    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is one
of several epigenetic mechanisms that cells use to control gene expression. DNA methylation<span> is a </span><span>biochemical process where a </span>methyl
group is added to the cytosine or adenine DNA nucleotides. The CpG sites are regions of DNA where a cytosine nucleotide occurs next to a guanine nucleotide. CpG islands are regions with a high
frequency of CpG sites. </p><p> In
the normal, healthy cells CpG islands are not methylated. Most of the
methylation occurs a short distance from the CpG islands rather than in the
islands themselves. In the cancer cells CpG islands are hypermethylated. </p><p>DNA methylation leads to silencing tumour
suppressor genes in cancer. The examples of hypermetylated CpG islands in gene  RB in
retinoblastoma, in gene MLH1 in colorectal cancer , gene  BRCA1 in breast cancer and gene  MGMT in gliomas and
colorectal tumours.</p><p>An intergenic region is a stretch of <span>DNA sequence
located between </span>genes. Intergenic
regions are a subset of Noncoding
DNA. Occasionally some intergenic DNA acts to
control genes nearby, but most of it has no currently known function. Intergenic
regions contain functionally important elements such as promoters and
enhancers. Also intergenic regions may contain as yet unidentified genes such
as noncoding RNAs. </p><p>Repetitive
DNA elements are found in multiple copies. Unlike
genes, most repetitive elements do not code for protein or RNA.</p><p>In normal cells
intergenic regions as well as repetitive elements are methylated.</p><p>Hypomethylation of intergenic regions
and repetitive elements in cancer cell lines is a common finding that can be
regarded as a biomarker of human cancers and leads to genomic instability that manifests as:  Illegitimate recombination between
repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and
disruption to neighbouring genes.</p><p> </p><p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic
imprinting <span>is an epigenetic phenomenon by which certain genes can be expressed in a parent-of-origin-specific
manner. </span><span>Igf2 and H19,
belonging to the same cluster of imprinted genes and regulated by ICR1, DMR2
and H19 promoter elements. </span> </p>

<p>H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated
on the paternal allele, and unmethylated on the maternal allele.</p>

<p>When maternal allele is unmethylated CTCF binds its insulator element,
and the enhancers will act on H19, but Igf2 will be silent for the maternal allele
and its expression will not be seen. </p>

<p>In paternal allele, the cluster is methylated and the enhancers can act
on Igf2, because CTCF is not binding to inhibit this, and Igf2 is expressed
from the pattern allele. </p>

<p>In cancer cell hypermethylation of the imprinting control region on the maternal
allele causes the expression of Igf2, so there is a double dose of Igf2 in comparison
to Igf2 contain in a normal cell. </p>

<p>Igf2 is both growth promoting, and this is associated with Wilm's
tumour. In Wilm’s tumour hypermethylation of ICR and Igf2
overexpression occurs.</p>

<p>In various tumour types alterations in DNA methylation at ICRs
(hypo or hypermethylation), can result in loss of expression of growth restricting
genes, overexpression of growth promoting genes<span>. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>

    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) sold as
Dacogen by Eisai, a Japanese company is a DNA-demethylating agent. It<span> is a </span>drug <span>for the treatment of </span>myelodysplastic
syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia a class of conditions where certain blood cells
are dysfunctional, and for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Decitabine chemically, it is a cytidine analog. Decitabine is
believed to exert its antineoplastic effects after phosphorylation and direct
incorporation into DNA and inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, causing
hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis. Decitabine-induced
hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cellular
differentiation and proliferation. </p>

<p> Epigenetic drugs alter the tumour
cells in some lasting way that made them more susceptible to standard
chemotherapy.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA hypermethylation intiates silencing of
tumor suppressor genes. An accumulation of genetic and epigenetic errors can
transform a normal cell into an invasive or metastatic tumor cell.
Additionally, DNA methylation patterns may cause abnormal expression of
cancer-associated genes.<br /></p><p><span>Altering DNA
methylation with drugs, can have effects on the epigenome even after drug
treatment. Muscle cells, neurons, liver cells, all cells in our bodies have the
same DNA, but differ by phenotype. This happens because of epigenetic marks.
Different cells, express different genes. These epigenetic marks (in this case
DNA methylation), are mitotically heritable. Muscle cells divide into other
muscle cells, and not neurons. Same happens when using drug treatment that
alter DNA methylation. </span></p><p><span>The methyl groups will be passed on continuously, leaving long
lasting effects in individuals. However, treating patients during sensitive
periods is inadvisable. Sensitive periods are phases of active remodeling of
the epigenome. Epigenetic marks get removed, and new epigenetic marks laid
down. Sensitive periods are present during germ cell development and during early
development. If we alter DNA methylation during these sensitive periods, it
would have a large effect on patients, leading to altered epigenomes, messed up
gene expression, and alterations in the phenotype.</span> </p></div>
