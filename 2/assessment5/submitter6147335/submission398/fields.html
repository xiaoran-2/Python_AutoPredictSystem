    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer, there are two main types of impairment in DNA methylation. The first one is the locus-specific DNA <strong>hypermethylation</strong>, which involved CpG island promoters (CIMPs) and CpG island shores of tumor suppresor genes.</p>

<p>The second type is the genome-wide DNA <strong>hypomethylation</strong>. This includes hypomethylation in repetitive regions and CpG-poor promoters. Disruption in DNA methylation could also lead to loss of imprinting, either due to hyper- or hypomethylation in ICR.</p>

<p>To understand how impairment in DNA methylation leads to cancer, we must look at the roles of DNA methylation.</p>

<p>DNA methylation is the basis for X-inactivation, imprinting, and heterochromatin formation. In general, it correlates to silencing of gene expression. In human genes, DNA methylation is almost exclusively found at CpG dinucleotides. CpG dinucleotides are usually methylated in intergenic regions and repeats, and kept unmethylated in CpG islands.</p>

<p>However, when those CpG islands are methylated, it led to gene expression silencing. It was found that in some cancer, the tumor suppressor genes are not mutated, instead they were hypermethylated at the CIMP. Therefore, DNA hypermethylation at CpG islands seems to be an alternative way to silence tumor suppressor genes.</p>

<p>In intergenic regions and repeats, the methylation of CpG dinucleotides plays a role in maintaining genomic integrity. For example, in intergenic regions, the function of methylation is to silence cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites. In repeats, methylation maintains silencing of repeats to prevent transposition, avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters, and avoid illegitimate recombination.</p>

<p>In cancer, the genome-wide hypomethylation found in repeats or intergenic intervals led to all kinds of genomic instability, such as illegitimate recombination, activation of repeats and transposition, and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighbor genes. Hypomethylation was also found in CpG poor promoters, and this causes oncogene activation.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">H19 contains an ICR (imprinting control region) that is methylated in paternal allele and unmethylated in maternal allele on normal cells. The unmethylated state in maternal allele led to the its expression and allows CTCF to bind. CTCF is an insulator protein that insulates Igf2 from the downstream enhancers.
The paternal allele is methylated and this will block the CTCF from binding. The lack of CTCF binding will allows DNA methylation to spread to the H19 promoter and silence it, and it also allows downstream enhancers to acces Igf2 to stimulate its expression.
<p>
In Wilms' tumor, the maternal allele is hypermethylated, which causes it to behave like paternal allele. Now, in maternal allele, as well as the paternal allele, CTCF cannot bind and this will allow enhancers to stimulate Igf2 and leads to double dose of Igf2. Igf2 itself is a growth factor that promotes growth and cell proliferation. With double dose of Igf2, the cells are stimulated to divide more and this contributes the development of neoplasm.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug that belongs to a class called DNMT inhibitors. </p>

<p>It is a nucleoside analogue, and by being a nucleoside analogue, it will get incorporated into DNA. After being incorporated in DNA, decitabine will bind irreversibly to DNMT. This causes DNMT to no longer be able perform its function, which is to maintain methylation in DNA.</p>

<p>DNA methylation is maintained during replication by DNMT1, which recognises and then methylates hemi-methylated DNA. Therefore, decitabine mechanism of action is replication-dependent, which means that the cells that will suffer most impact from this drug are cells that actively replicating, and as we know that is one of the hallmark of cancer cells, they are very actively replicating. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, meaning that altering it will cause epigenetic changes that will be inherited by its descendants. It's mitotically heritable mainly due to the work of DNMT1, which maintains methylation during replication, and because TET proteins (involved in active demethylation) are only expressed at very restricted times in development.</p>

<p>This led to hypothesis that epigenetic therapy that targets DNA methylation could have some lasting effects.</p>

<p>As for the periods where one should avoid treating patients with epigenetic drugs, these are called sensitive periods. Sensitive periods are the times when cells are very sensitive to changes in environment and susceptible to epigenetic alterations. There are two such periods in human, one is during germ cell development and the second is during early embryonic development. During these sensitive periods, epigenetic marks were cleared, except ones on the repeats and, in early embryonic development, the imprinted genes. The epigenetic marks need to be cleared in order to lay down new marks, and this is when it could go wrong. If a person was treated with drug that alter epigenetic state during these periods, there might be disruption in clearing or in laying down new marks. </p>
