    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is inversely proportional in gene expression. In normal cells, CpG islands are generally kept independent from methylation regardless of their state. However in cancer cells, CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated which causes silencing of underlying genes, ie. tumor-suppressor genes. CpG island hypermethylation is globally present in almost every tumor type. Once the CpG island is hypermethylated it will disrupt the cell cycle and allow cells to grow and produce rapidly that will result to tumor formation. Aside from CpG island hypermethylation, a global hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements is observed to some degree in all tumor types. The consequence of hypomethylation for intergenic and repetitive regions brings about genomic instability that is due to activation of transposable elements and loss of imprinting. In normal cells, transposable elements cannot be activated in an methylated environment. These genome wide hypomethylation results in a.) illegitimate recombination within repeats which cannot happen in normal cells, despite having similar regions, since the repeats are generally densely-packed. Identity and open chromatin are the primary requirements of recombination b.) activation of repeats wherein it makes a copy of itself that can be inserted throughout the genome resulting to disruption of coding or activation of neighboring genes  both of these results to deletion, insertion and reciprocal translocation in cancer cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cells, Imprint control region (ICR) in H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated in paternal allele and unmethylated in maternal allele. An insulator protein, CTCF is binded in the unmethylated maternal allele. Being an insulator protein, CTCF "insulates" Igf2 from downstream enhancers, thus the enhancers act on H19 rather than Igf2 (termed as chromatin looping). On the paternal allele, since CTCF is absent, DNA methylation from imprint control regions can spread downstream in H19 promoter resulting to silencing and the enhancers can freely access Igf2 resulting to its expression. Igf2 is expressed only in paternal allele and not in maternal allele (paternally imprinted).
A characteristic feature of Wilm's tumor is the overexpression of Igf2 due to hypermethylation of ICR in maternal allele. Once the maternal ICR is methylated, there is no CTCF binding thus the enhancers are free to activate Igf2, just like in the paternal allele resulting to a double dose of Igf2. Igf2 is growth promoting which is a characteristic of Wilm's tumor.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to a class of drugs known as DNA demethylating agents. We learned that DNA methylation is a major factor in the regulation of gene expression. In cancer, such as leukemia, there is an increase in DNA methylation that causes the silencing of genes responsible for regulation of cell division and growth. Decitabine hypomethylates the DNA, thereby re-activating the silenced tumor suppressing genes to restore normal cell growth and decrease tumor growth. Decitabine is also considered as anti-metabolite that is similar to normal substances in the cell but once integrated in cell cycle, can cause senescence on cancer cells.

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">A sensitive period is defined as a time window in an individual's development wherein a function, or gene development is most vulnerable to environmental factors which can have lasting effect not only for the lifetime of that individual but also its progeny. In mammals, there are generally two sensitive period- 1) primordial germ cell development to development of mature egg or sperm cells and 2) pre-implantation and early post implantation period, both these periods are stages of active remodelling of genome, removal and laying down of epigenetic marks.   DNA methylation plays a big role in laying down these epigenetic marks, if cancer patients are treated with DNA methylating drugs in these sensitive period, it doesn't solely affect the patient but can potentially affect up to the third generation especially when dealing with females that are pregnant with a female baby (grandmaternal effects). DNA methylation is mitotically heritable that's why it is said that it has enduring effect in the epigenome.</div>
