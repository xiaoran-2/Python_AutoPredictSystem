    <div class="field-value">Methylation of DNA is found on one of the four DNA bases: cytosin can be methylated yielding 5-methylcytosine. Together with it`s partner Guanin on the opposite DNA-strand it forms a CpG pair.<br /><br />In many promoter regions a lot of CpG pairs are densely packed together to form "CpG-islands", which in normal cells are unmethylated allowing the promoter to express the gene. In cancer cells these CpG islands are hypermethylated resulting in inactivation of the gene. As a result the promoters of tumor suppressor genes are also silenced. This leads to uncontrolled growth - a hallmark of cancer cells.<br /><br />In contrast to CpG islands dispersed single CpG's in intergenic regions and repetitive elements are mostly methylated. This contributes to silencing of tranposable elements which can disrupt the genome and avoids transcription from unwanted start sites. In cancer cells these regions become hypomethylated. Additionally, hypomethylation of regions which are normally silenced, can lead to a regrouping of genes from silenced compartments near membrane of the nucleus to more active compartments in the interior. Transposable elements jump to unwanted sites in the genome and alternative uncontrolled transcription occurs in intergenic regions. As a result the stabilty of the genome is compromised- another hallmark of cancer cells.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The H19/Igf2 cluster consists of a gene for the growth hormone Igf2, an imprinting control centre (ICR), a gene for the long non-coding RNA H19 and enhancers. (The role of H19 is not relevant in this context).<br /><br />In the paternal allele the ICR is methylated. The enhancers can act upstream on the Igf2 gene, which is expressed on the paternal allele.<br /><br />In the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated. The unmethylated status of the ICR leads to binding of an insulator protein CTCF. In is way the Igf2 gene is isolated from the enhancer and not expressed.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumor the maternal allele which normally downregulates the growth factor Igf2 and upregulates the tumor suppressor Cdkn 1c is compromised due to genetic or epigenetic changes and the expression of Igf2 on the paternal allele is upregulated. Together this leads to underproduction of tumor suppressors and overproduction of Igf2 which acts as an oncogene or growth promoter.<br /><br />Methylation of the ICR in the maternal H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer, because the lack of the insulator protein CTCF leads to production of Igf2 on the maternal paternal and allele. Unchecked growth hormones contribute to cancer development and growth.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is an epigenetic drug sold by an Japanese company. The drug is prescibed to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, a precursor of leukemia. Decitabine demethylates DNA and in doing so restores the expression of housekeeping genes that control the cell cycle, DNA repair and tumor supressors. Active tumor suppressors prevent cangerogenic cells from division and lead to cell death (apoptosis).  Because epigenetic changes are heritable, the DNA in treated cells remains demethylated and the housekeepind genes remain active after cell division.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic marks like DNA Methylation are mitotically inheritable. As a consequence the alteration of a cancer cell by treatment with an epigenetic drug, for instance a drug that removes DNA-methylation marks, will be passed on the the next cell generation even if the drug treatment is stopped.<br /><br />However, in the life cycle of organisms there are periods in which epigenetic marks are cleared and reprogrammed. These periods include epigenetic reprogramming in germ cell development and early development. During reprogramming most epigenetic marks are erased and refreshed. Any disturbance of the epigenetic processes during the sensitive periods can lead to major (often fatal) problems in the development of the organism due to disturbances in the epigenome. Drugs causing epigenetic changes should be avoided in the sensitive periods.<br /><br /></div>
