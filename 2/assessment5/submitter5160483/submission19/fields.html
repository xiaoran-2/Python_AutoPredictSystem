    <div class="field-value"><p><i>In
mammals about 60% and 96% of all CpG-islands are methylated. In
<u>normal cells</u> we find <u>hypomethylation in the CpG-islands
</u>whereas the i<u>nteregenic regions and repetitive elements show
</u><u>hyper</u><u>methylation</u>. In <b>cancer cells</b> we observe
a swap of methylation, leaving <b>CpG isl</b><b>a</b><b>nds
hypermethylated</b> and <b>intergen</b><b>i</b><b>c regions and
repetitive elements hypomethylated</b>. </i>
</p>
<p><i>As
we procede from normal cells to cancerous cells the global amount of
methylated 5mcs decreases, whereas CpG island methylations increases.
This results in transcriptional silencing which can be mitotically
inherited, and so can cause an activation of oncogenes by influencing
growth promoters, or an inactivation of tumor suppressors (silencing)
by decreasing apoptosis rates. </i>
</p>
<p><i>Research
shows that hypermethylation in cancer cells is a common phenomenon.
This allows diagnosis of diseases by e.g. comparing benign skin cells
to tumor cells derived from the same sample. Also, since
hypermethylation is associated with metastasis, this makes DNA
biomarkers favoured as sensitive cancer detectors. As
hypermethylation increases with tumorigenicity, the method of using
biomarker-panels for diagnosis and prognosis, e.g. CIMP, provides
clinicians with the possibility of identifying tumor types,
sub-types and primary tumor which are unknown (frequency of
hypermethylation), genom wide!</i></p>
<p><i>Hypomethylation
of intergenic regions and repetitive elements, which also seem to
occur in any tumor, on the other hand causes genomic instability.
Just as hypermethylation, hypomethylation progresses with
tumorgenicity. Instability activates repeats and causes them to
recombine or transposit. Phenomena as deletions, reciprocal
translocations and insertions can occur in genome regions which are
not densely packed (Heterochromatin). In addition the instability can
cause activation of cryptic promorers and disruption of neighbouring
genes. </i></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><i>In
a <u>normal cell</u> the <u>ICR</u> of the <u>paternal</u> allele is
<u>methylated</u>, which leads to a direct effect of the enhancers on
<u>Igf2</u>, which is thereby <u>expressed</u>. </i>
</p>
<p><i>In
the <b>maternal</b> allele the <b>ICR</b> is <b>unmethylated</b>.
This causes <b>CTCF</b> to <b>bind</b> to the imprinting control
region and causes an effect of enhancers on <b>H19</b>. <b>Igf2</b>,
in this case, stays silent and thereby <b>unexpressed</b>.</i></p>
<p><i>In
<b>cancer cells</b> both, the <b>ICRs</b> in the <b>paternal</b> and
<b>maternal</b> alleles are <b>hypermethylated</b>. This causes
enhancers to directly affect the <b>Igf2</b> regions. Igf2 is being
activated and thereby <b>expressed</b>. This leaves the organism with
a double dose of Igf2, compared to normal. Since Igf2 works as growth
promoter, <b>uncontrolled</b> cell <b>growth</b> is a direct result
of hypermethylation. </i></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine,
a DNA-demethylating agent,
is used to treat myelodysplastic
syndromes. The drug is planned to target
the <u>inhibition </u><u>of
</u><u>the overactive </u><u>enzyme
EZH2</u>, which
<u>attaches methyl groups to histone
proteins</u>. Due to <u>overmethylation,</u>
<u>neighbouring</u>
<u>genes</u>
and <u>tumor</u>
<u>supressor</u>
<u>genes</u>,
are <u>silenced</u>.
Research shows drastic decrease of histone methylation rate as well
as reduction of proliferation of tumour cells in both, cell cultures
and animalmodels
which were
treated with GSK2816126; GSK2816126 does
not show any impact on normal cells. 
</p><p>Another
approach tested that JQ1
(which
inhibits BRD4)
blocks the activity of Myc, which
encodes for a transcription factor,
which is known to be involved in the
gene expression of about 15% of all
human genes.
Animal models have shown a shut down of Myc-activated genes and
slowed proliferation of myeloma cells.</p><p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Treatment
with a histone-deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine, as in the
research conducted by Dr Stephen Baylin, seem to have great impact on
tumour growth in cancer patients. Administration of epigenetic drugs,
which cause epigenetic changes in the genome, has to be performed in
a <u>period sensitive manner.</u> Since <u>epigenetic markers</u> are
<u>passed</u> <u>during</u> <u>mitosis</u> they can be <u>manipulated</u>
and actively <u>deleted</u> from the <u>genome</u>. If epigenetic
marks have been removed once, they are not to be brought back. If
manipulation/deletion happens during sensitive periods, as
<u>pre-/post-implementation</u>, <u>PGD</u> or <u>tissue specific
differentiation periods</u>, the treatment can have serious effects
on the organism. In periods of somatic maintenance the cells are less
sensitive to alterations in DNS-methylation.</span></p><p>
</p><p><span>If
applied in appropriate time frames epigenetic drugs might cause
effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all
its cells.</span></p></div>
