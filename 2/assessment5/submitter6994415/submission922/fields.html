    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG Islands in normal cells silences gene expression primarily by causing an condensation of chromatin structure and in more limited cases by prohibiting transcription factor binding. CpG Islands are usually un methylated. In cancer CpG island hypermethylation ie an increase in methylation of specific CpG Islands. This silences tumour suppressor genes thereby selecting for tumour growth and can be one of the hits in the Knudsen hypothesis. The CpG islands affected varies by tumour type.</p>
<p><span>Normally there is widespread DNA methylation in intergenic regions and of repetitive elements. This maintains genomic integrity silencing repeats to prevent transposition, transcriptional interference and illegitimate recombination. In cancer this is disrupted genome wide hypo methylation is found in repetitive elements and intergenic regions this increases with tumorigenicity. The hypo methylation causes genomic instability via illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighbouring genes. Again the consequences of the hypo methylation depends on the location and is tumour specific.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>On the paternal allele imprint control region is methylated CTCF cannot bind and insulate therefore H19 remains silenced and enhancers promote igf2. On the maternal allele there is no methylation of the imprint control region CTCF can bind and the enhancers promote H19 so igf2 is not activated. In a wilms tumour imprinting is disrupted the maternal allele imprint control region is methylated so igf2 is activated on both maternal and paternal alleles giving a double dose of a growth promoting factor which then contributes to potential tumour growth.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent. Decitabine acts by reducing methylation on the genome targeting enzymes using small molecule DNA methyl transferase inhibitors. Nucleotide analogues are incorporated into the DNA of the tumour and then they bind the DNMT irreversibly so it cannot continue acting so as the tumour cell replicates it cannot maintain its methyl marks hyper methylation is reduced potentially reactivating tumour suppressor cells and reducing tumour growth.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">As cells divide the demethylating effect of the drugs will be maintained in new cells as epigenetic changes are heritable. The effect will therefore have an enduring effect on new tumour cells that will also have reduced hypermethylation. Sensitive periods are periods of development that are particularly important in the laying down or removal of epigenetic marks eg in early development or gametogenesis. Treating patients during these periods would be inadvisable as the demethylating drugs have a lack of specificity so will act on all cells and not just tumour cells. They could affect gamete formation eg imprinting, and have long term affects on normal cells as their method of action is still not fully understood.</div>
