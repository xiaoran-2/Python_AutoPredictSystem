    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value">CpG islands in gene promoter regions of normal cells are usually unmethylated and associated with normal gene expression. CpG island methylation is associated with gene silencing. Cancer is associated with CpG island hypermethylation and suppression of tumor suppressor gene expression favoring cancer development. Intragenic and repetitive elements in normal cells are usually methylated. This is thought to maintain genomic stablilty by silencing cryptic start sites or cryptic splice sites at intragenic regions, silence repeats and prevent transposition, avoid transcription interference for strong promoters, and prevent illegitimate recombinations. Hypermethylation at intragenic regions and repeats and genomic instabilty are found in all cancers. This can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes or over expression of growth promoting genes favoring the development of cancer. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">A common feature of cancer cells is loss of imprinting. Hypo- or hypermethylation of ICRs can result in loss of expression of growth restriction genes or over expression of growth promoting genes. When imprinting is lost, genes become expressed or silenced from both parental alleles. As an example Igf2 gene expression is ICR controlled.  In normal cells the maternal ICR is methylated, binds CTCF, which insulates the Igf2 gene from enhancers, preventing expression of Igf2, but alllows expression of the unmethylated H19 gene instead. The paternal ICR is methylated  as well as the H19 gene, does not express the methylated H19 gene, does not bind the insulator, allowing expresses the Igf2 gene. In Wilms tumor the maternal ICR is methylated causing it to behave like the paternal allele expressing Igf2. This results in a double dose of Igf2 which is growth promoting favoring the development of cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) effective in treating some hematologic malignancies. It is a nucleoside analogue which is incorporated into DNA when the cell is dividing. It irreversibly binds DNMT preventing DNA methylation. Although the precise mechanism of action is unclear it has a negative effect in cancer cell growth. One possible explanation is that hematological malignancies may be dependent on tumor cell suppressor hypermethylation (due to loss of tumor cell suppressor expression and activity).</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The epigenetic state is mitotically heritable.  DNA methylation can alter the epigenetic state and gene expresion of a tumor cell.  These changes would continue to be expressed in all of the daughter cells and subsequent cell divisions thus lasting beyond the drug treatment period.  Sensitive periods of human development are times of epigenetic reprogrammng (clearing and resetting epigenetic marks) which occurs in primordial germ cell and early embryonic development. Sensitive periods may also occur in later gamete maturation in reproductive males and especially females. Drugs that affect epigenetics should be avoided in these situations because alteration of the epigenome could have unknown (including harmful) effects on gene expression. Interference with DNA methylation during sensitive periods could disrupt normal clearing and setting of the epigenetic marks important for imprinted genes as well as pleuripotency and cellular differentiation.<br /></div>
