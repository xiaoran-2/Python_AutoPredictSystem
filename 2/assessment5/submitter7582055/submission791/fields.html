    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li><b>DNA methylation at CpG islands:</b></li></ul><b>Normal: not methylated.</b> CpG islands are often at promoters of genes and they are normally protected from methylation. Tumor suppressor genes are<b> ac</b><b></b><b>tive</b> because CpG islands are in promoters of those genes -- they are doing their job.<b><br />In cancer: becomes hypermethylated. </b>Methylation of CpG islands is mitotically heritable and is getting higher with time of cancer-genesis. Tumor suppressor genes become<b> inactive </b>because of hypermethylation of CpG islands. They are not functioning(stop controlling cell cycle and apoptosis) and that is one of the 'hits' in cancer initiation. <br /><ul><li><b></b><b>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements:</b></li></ul><b>Normal: methylated. </b>Intergenic methylation is found at repetitive sequences (satellite repeats, LINEs and SINEs). Methylation of intergentic regions and repetitive elements is very important because it helps to<strong> maintain genomic integrity</strong>. Methylation of these sites normally <span>repress transcriptional noise from alternative start sites, inhibit antisense transcription or direct RNA splicing, also is assotiated with replication timing</span><br /><b>In cancer: becomes hypomethylated.</b> This change of methylations could determine <strong>genome instability</strong> (more chromosomal mutations occur), which would lead to cancer development.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>In <strong>paternal</strong> allele of normal cells ICR (imprint control region) is methylated, H19 is methylated also (no expression) and CTCF can't bind ICR element. That's why enhancers can act directly on <strong>Igf2</strong> and promote it's <strong>expression</strong>. <br /></li><li>In <strong>maternal</strong> allele of normal cells ICR (imprint control region) is unmethyated and CTCF can bind it. So the enhancers in this case act on H19 but there is <strong>no expression of Igf2</strong> in this allele. <br /></li><li><strong>Wilm's tumor</strong>: There is <strong>hypermethylation of ICR</strong> not only in the paternal but also in the maternal allele. In that way the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted, because there is no expression of H19 and also<strong> Igf2 is </strong><b>over-expressed</b> (from both-parental and maternal-alleles).</li><li>If there is a disruption of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster, like described before, there would be <strong>double Igf2 dose</strong>. While <strong>Igf2 is a growth promoting gene</strong>, that would lead to <strong>tumor growth</strong> -- which is necessary for cancer development.</li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li><span>DNA methylation is a<b> very stable epigenetic mark</b>, which is<b> passed on to following cell generations </b>by mitosis. That's why it is important to think about further effects of altering the DNA methylation.</span></li><li>Sensitive periods of development is when<strong> reprogramming of DNA methylation occurs</strong>.<br /></li><li>Sensitive periods are during <b>gametogenesis</b> and <b>after fertilization.</b><br /></li><li>Because you could change (inhibit or promote) DNA methylation or other epigenetic marks of different genes permanently and that could lead to other, different diseases, health problems and, in fact, could be very harmful not only to this patient but also other generations (as we know that some of epigenetic factors are inherited).</li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent which belongs to <strong>DNA methyltransferase epigenetic inhibitors</strong>.<br /></li><li>It demethylates DNA.</li><li>It can <strong>hypomethylate CpG islands which are in tumor supressor gene promoters</strong> and that's how they can be expressed again and regulate cell cycle, apoptosis and regulation of DNA damages.</li></ul></div>
