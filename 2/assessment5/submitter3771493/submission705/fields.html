    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are cytosine-guanine dinucleides that are found gathered together into islands, usually at the promoters of genes, where transcription factors bind. They tend to be protected from DNA methylation, but  if they are methylated, that gene is silenced. In cancer, these CpG islands tend to be over (hyper-) methylated leading to silencing of the that gene. As these genes tend to be tumour suppressors (which put the "brakes" on cell division), silencing them will lead to loss of control of cell division. The cell will divide more rapidly and soon become dominant. This is a hallmark of cancer.<br /><br />Intergenic regions and repetitive elements can be detrimental if they are active as they can lead to genomic instability.  This includes recombination between chromosomes, genes "jumping" around the genome, etc. This can be mutagenic.  This activity can be prevented from happening by silencing these regions. This is done by heavily methylating and heterochromatising them. In cancer, these regions will be under (hypo-) methylated leading to them being reactivated.  This will will lead to genomic instability - deletions, insertions and translocations - all of which are found in cancer. There are also promoters that have a much lower level of CpG dinucleides in them. These are normally methylated and the gene silenced.  The gene in this case is an oncogene, one which acts as an "accelerator" on the cell cycle.  In cancer, these CpG poor promoters are hypomethylated, activating the oncogene and leading to uncontrolled cell division as before.<br /><br />In summary, the contribution of DNA methylation to cancer is a) genome wide demethylation leading to genomic instability and oncogene activation, and b) hypermethylation of tumour suppressors. This can vary depending on the tumour type and stage of tumourigenesis.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">You have two alleles: one from your mother and one from your father. On some genes, one of these will be silenced in a parent-of-origin, specific manner. This happens via areas called imprint control regions (ICRs), the imprint is associated with methylation of these ICRs. The consequence of this imprinting depends on the cluster/locus where it has occurred. One example of an imprinted cluster is the H19/IGF2 cluster. In a normal cell, only the paternal ICR is methylated. The  maternal ICR is unmethylated allowing an insulator protein called CTCF to bind to it. This will prevent downstream enhancers binding to the Igf2 gene, instead they will bind to H19. This means that Igf2 is silent. In the paternal allele, the CTCF cannot bind to the ICR, and the enhancers are free to act on Igf2. <br /><br />This imprinting goes astray in Wilms tumour, a paediatric kidney tumour. In this case the maternal allele is also methylated so CTCF cannot bind which allows the enhancers to act on Igf2. This leads to double the amount of IGF2 (a growth factor involved with growth promotion during gestation) being produced. This will stimulate uncontrolled growth of cells leading to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In recent years, drugs have been designed to target the aberrant epigenetic machinery found in cancer. These "mistakes" are a hallmark of every cancer. These drugs include inhibitors of the following: DNA methyltransferase (DNMT); histone deacetylase (HDAC); histone methyltransferase (HMT); histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and histone demethyltransferase (HDM). Decitabine (sold as Dacogen by Eisai Pharmaceuticals) is used for treating myeloplastic syndrome - a precursor to acute myelogenous leukaemia. It is a member of the DNMT inhibitor family and is a nucleoside analogue which gets incorporated into the daughter strand during DNA replication (division dependant). When DNMT1 comes along to methylate the daughter strand, it binds irreversibly to the analogue. This prevents DNMT1 from methylating the daughter strand leading to hypomethylation. This in turn will lead to reduced silencing of tumour suppressors leading to their increased activity.  As cancer cells divide much more rapidly than normal ones, they will be affected more strongly.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetics is the study of mitotically heritable changes in gene expression. The term "mitotically heritable" means that these changes will be passed down to the daughter cells on cell division. These changes include DNA methylation marks.  If these marks are changed somehow during treatment with epigenetic drugs, then these alterations will be permanent and will also be inherited by the daughter cells. <br /><br />However, there are periods when these marks will be removed and new ones applied.  This is called epigenetic reprogramming.  There are two main phases of reprogramming; the first is  during the period between fertilisation and implantation of the embryo, when sperm and egg marks are removed and new marks reset in a lineage specific manner. The second is in the mid gestation when cells that will become sperm or eggs are derived from somatic cells. The primordial germ cell marks are reset. <br /><br />These periods of reprogramming are very sensitive to environmental factors (including  epigenetic drugs) as these can interfere with the reprogramming and could have disastrous effects on the epigenome. These changes will be mitotically heritable. These are sensitive periods and because of the potential risk to the epigenome, epigenetic drugs should not be given at these times.</div>
