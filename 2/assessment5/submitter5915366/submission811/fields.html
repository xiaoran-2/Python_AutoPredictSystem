    <h1>Submission 811 from Anon (session_user_id: 65c87646efa9b3418feeaf1f9e16351844be4782)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">One theory regarding cancer is that the inappropriate methylation of histones results in the silencing of genes including tumor suppressing genes.  Without the tumor suppressing genes's being able to monitor and control growth of cells, the abnormal cell growth results in a cancerous tumor.  Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent which would work to unlock the histones and therefore allow the tumor-suppressing genes to activate and diminish the tumor.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A mutation, a change in the DNA itself, is not available for alteration in the way that epigenetic changes can be impacted.  The epigenetic process is one of turning genes on and off through methylation or demethylation.  Once in place, the epigenetic change is continued in the daughter cells as the cells reproduce. A sensitive period refers to periods in early development when epigenetic reprogramming is taking place or when epigenetic marks are being established.  This includes preconception, early development, post implantation. Altering this process, for example during pregnancy, would permanently alter the development of the fetus in ways that may be unpredictable and possibly fatal. A counter point is that even in adults a single cell can have a "sensitive period" in which an alteration happens that down the road can result in cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is essential to maintaining the stability and integrity of the genome by balancing genes to be activated and those to be silenced. CpG islands are control switches for downstream genes.  When CpG islands are inappropriately methylated,  tumor suppressor genes, for example, are silenced allowing uncontrolled cellular growth resulting in a cancerous tumor. The hypermethylation of CpG Islands progresses with time.  Methylation becomes reversed so that active areas in the normal cell become methylated and methylated areas become activated.  Other disruptions occur such as inability of cellular repair genes to repair chromosomal damage. Some genes develop lengthy repeats which further unbalance the system, tumor cells become immortal, illegitimate recombinations, abnormal karyotypes,</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprinting silences a gene and in the case of the H19/lgf2 cluster, the maternal gene for lgf2 is methylated resulting in the Enhancer stimulating H19.  On the paternal gene, CTCF is methylated as well as H19 which results in the Enhancer stimulating lgf2.  If in error, the maternal CTCF and H19 are methylated, the Enhancer then skips over to the Maternal lgf2 and activates expression.  This results in overexpressioin of lgf2 leading to Wilm's tumor and cancer.</div>
