    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>In general, DNA methylation is inversely related to the
expressiveness of the related genes. Normally, the CpG islands in the promoters
of tumour suppressor genes are hypomethylated. This means that these genes are
expressed and can stop uncontrolled cell growth.  In cancer, these CpG islands tend to be
hypermethylated.  This results in
silencing of these tumour suppressor genes. Futhermore, since DNA methylation
is mitotically heritable, this leads to the growth of malignant cells where
these genes are silenced.</span></p>

<p><span>In contrast to the normally hypomethylated CpG islands,
intergenic regions of the genome as well as repetitive elements are normally
hypermethylated. DNA methylation in this case helps maintain genomic stability
and prevents deleterious deletes, inserts and/or translations.  For example, these regions contain
transposable elements that might cause these kinds of mutations.</span></p>

<p>Furthermore, there are genes in intergenic regions that if
not silenced might transcribe in an antisense direction. These could interfere and
block important genes upstream resulting in transcription error to the latter. Similarly,
in repetitive elements, there are strong promoters that if not suppressed might
interfere with normal transcription as well. </p>

<p>Finally, methylation prevents splicer proteins from
incorrectly splicing regions where the sequences resemble normal splice sites.</p>

<p>In cancer, these regions especially in the repeats that are
normally methylated are hypomethylated. As mentioned above, the non-silencing
of these regions can wreck havocs to the normal transcriptions of the genome.</p><span>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell, the imprint control region (ICR) of the
paternal allele is methylated. Because of this, the ICR is not insulated by
CTCF protein and downstream enhancers can act on the growth factor gene Igf2
allowing it to be expressed. <br /><br />On the other hand, in the maternal allele, the ICR
is not methylated. This allows the CTCF protein to bind and insulate that
region. As a result, the enhancers downstream cannot act on the Igf2 gene effectively
silencing it.

<br /><p>In Wilm’s tumour (a childhood kidney tumour), the maternal
allele’s ICR is methylated similar to the paternal allele’s. This allows the
maternal allele’s enhancer to act on its Igf2 gene causing it to be expressed.
As a result, the dosage of Igf2 is doubled that of the normal cell. Since Igf2
promotes growth, this is a factor in the proliferation of cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine also known as Dacogen is a type of DNA
methyltransferase inhibitor drugs (DNMTi). Decitabine is targetted for a blood
type cancer called Myelodysplastic syndrome that has progressed to Acute
Myeloid Leukemia (AML). This disease caused the bone marrow to not make enough
healthy blood cells. 

<br /><p>Decitabine is an FDA approved drug
that acts to remove DNA methylations that are silencing tumour suppressor
genes. This drug is a nucleoside analogue which gets incorporated into
DNA through replication. It binds with DNMT leading to cell death. Since cancer
cells are fast replicating, this drug affects cancer cells more than normal
cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. This means that
methylation is passed on from cells to their daughter cells. Because of this, a
drug that affects the methylation state might initially show little promise
during trials only to have very positive effects on tumour cells after the
trial period.

<br /><p>Sensitive periods are periods of epigenetic reprogramming
where the epigenetic marks are cleared and reset.  Primarily, this happens during early embryonic
development as well as during the development of primordial germ cells (eggs
and sperms). Outside of these, there are also sensitive periods during cell
differentiation. </p>

<p>Treating a patient during such periods might cause errors
with the resetting of epigenetic marks. In particular, if this happens during
germ cells development, the error might propagate into future generations.</p>

Because of this, it is important to avoid treating patients during these
periods.</div>
