    <div class="field-value"><div>DNA methylation is the addition of a methyl group to the DNA, and this happens at cytosines.In mammals, DNA methylation occurs almost at Cs that are followed by Gs.This is called a CpG dinucleotide where p is  the phosphate bond.These dinucleotides are symmetrical when you look at the other side, the other strand of DNA, and this allows them to be maintained through cell division and you remember this is one features of epigenetic modifications and is caused by DNA methylase.<br />Its regulates transcription and known for silencing of gene expression.DNA methylation is an inactive epigenetic mark. DNA methylation patterns –
hypermethylation and hypomethylation compared to normal tissue – have been
associated with a large number of human malignancies. Hypermethylation
typically occurs at CpG islands in the promoter region and is associated with
gene inactivation. A lower level of leukocytes DNA
methylation is associated with many types of cancer.Global
hypomethylation has also been implicated in the development and progression of
cancer through different mechanisms. <br />There is hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes and
hypomethylation of oncogenes. Normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic and repetitive elementss is genome stability which is disrupted in cancer due to hypomethylation at CpG islands. <br /><div>Different tumours have different dependencies like Driven by tumour suppressor hypermethylation, then depletion of DNA methylation appears to suppress tumorigenesis and Driven by chromosomal instability, then depletion of DNA methylation appears to enhance tumorigenesis.</div></div><p></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon by which certain genes can be expressed in a parent-of-origin-specific
manner.It may ensure transposable elements remain epigenetically silenced
throughout gametogenic reprogramming to maintain genome integrity.It is process that involves DNA methylation,histone modification resulting monoallelic gene expression without altering sequence. These
epigenetic marks are established in the germline and can be maintained
through mitotic divisions.Hypomethylation is found in imprint control regions,this depends on imprint control region and function of the genes found within this region. In case of IGF2 there is hypermethylation of imprint control regions in some instances and hypomethylation in other control regions in others.This cluster is methylated on paternal allele,it's unmethylated on the maternal allele.When it's unmethylated CTCF binds insulator element,it means that enhancers will act on H19. But Igf2 will be silent for maternal allele,so no expression.On paternal allele,due to methylation enhancers can act on IGF2,as CTCF is not binding to inhibit this,IGF2 is expressed.With loss of imprinting and hypermethylation of imprint control region on maternal allele,expression is seen of Igf2.So there is double dose of Igf2 in comparison to normal.Igf2 is growth promoting,and causes Wilm's tumour.It occurs at very early stage.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor and is hypomethylating agent.It incorporates into DNA upon replication,and then,when DNA methyltransferasecomes alongto bind,DNMT1 comes along to bind that nucleotide anf copies methylation to daughter strand.DNA methyltransferase is bound irreversibly and canno longer be released.Action of DNA methyltransferase inhibitor is division dependent so you have to have the cell replicating.Cancer cells are dividing much more rapidly than most other cells in the bodyand will be more severely affected.When there is increase in DNA methylation,it results blockage of suppressor genes that regulate cell division and growth.Suppressor genes are blocked,cell division is unregulated,allowing or promoting cancer.Decitabine has anti-tumor effects that its work is by demythylation.By this action,normal funtion of tumor suppressor genes is restored,restoring control over cell growth.Decitabine is anti-metabolite.When cells incorporate these substancesinto metabolism ,they interact with targets within cell to produce direct cytotoxic effect causing death of rapidly  dividing cancer cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation switches genes on or off depending on its action on transcription site.This nature suggests epigenetic processes are susciptible to chemical intervention.So if methyl group is blocked and prevented fron binding on histone thus affect chromosome packaging.This causes gene silencing and role of tumor suppresoor genes is also affected.<br />Dr Baylin showed that combination of histone deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine slowed umor growth.It helped against solid tumors where drug has to be penetrated in tumor.And in some cases there was later good response of chemotreraupeutic drugs which were later given.So some epigenetic drugs had long lasting effect that made them more susciptible to standard chemotherapy.These can be passed to further generations until erased.So these drrugs may affect at very early stages and may affect epigenetic marks  that is in sensitive perios(It is when epigenetic marks are eastablished) and so these drugs may alter epigenetic makeup.So its anadvisable as they affect all cells and can cause harmful affects on epigenetic machinery and can cause effects later.</div>
