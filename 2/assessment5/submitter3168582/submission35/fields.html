    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are not normally methylated,
since DNA methylation at CpG islands normally means silencing of gene
expression. </p>

<p><span>However, in cancer cells CpG islands are
usually hypermethylated. This 
hypermethylation can result in silencing of tumour suppressor genes.
Since methylation is mitotically heritable, this is a very good locking down
mechanism in terms if epigenetic silencing. This DNA methylation can be one of
the hits in the Knudson hypothesis. </span></p>

<p><span>On the contrary, in intergenic regions and
repetitive elements DNA is usually methylated contributing to genomic
stability, though the heterochromatin structure. However, in cancer cells these
regions are hypomethylated (genome-wide hypomethylation). DNA hypomethylation promotes genomic instability, </span><span><span>illegitimate recombination between repeats,
deletions, insertions, reciprocal translocations, activation of repeats and
transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring
genes, </span>activates tumour-promoting genes and leads to loss of imprinting.</span><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>H19/Igf2 cluster is an example of
enhancer blocking. In the paternal allele DNA methylation at imprinting control
regions (ICR) blocks binding of CTCF, which is an insulator protein and
insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. Without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads
to H19 (long non-coding RNA) promoter to silence and enhancers can access Igf2
to activate. In the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated, hence CTCF can
bind. The enhancers activate H19 expression on the maternal allele. Therefore,
Igf2 is only expressed from the paternal allele.     </span></p>

<p><span>In Wilm’s tumour, there is loss of imprinting due
to hypermethylation of the imprint control region on the maternal allele as
well, therefore there is also expression of Igf2 from the maternal allele as
well. Hence there is a double dose of Igf2 compared to the normal cell. Igf2 is
a growth factor, that is it promotes growth, hence it is associated with Wilm’s
tumour.  </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitors (DNMTi). </span></p>

<p>Decitabine at low doses sequesters and degrades DNMTs after
incorporation into DNA, leading to global DNA demethylation and consequent
reactivation of promoter hypermethylated genes, including aberrantly silenced
tumour suppressor genes. Their non selective action depends on DNA replication, and since
tumour cells divide more rapidly than the other cells in the body they will be
more severly affected from this drug since they are replicating more. Still, its long term effects on normal cells
and mechanism of action is unclear. </p>

<p><span>It probably has an effect on hematological
malignancies, such as AML, since these are dependent on tumour suppressor gene
hypermethylation, through reactivating many epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor genes. </span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The reversibility of epigenetic abnormalities makes the epigenetic
enzymes responsible for establishing these modifications good targets for
therapeutic intervention. DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, hence it
can have enduring effects on the genome, meaning that epigenetic changes are
passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they
are actively erased.</p>

<p>Although DNA methylation is a very stable
epigenetic mark, which is passed on to subsequent cell generations,
reprogramming of DNA methylation occurs during gametogenesis and after
fertilization or after artificial reprogramming of somatic cells into induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSC).</p>

<p>A sensitive period is when clearing and
resetting of epigenetic marks occurs, such as primordial germ cell development
and early emryonic development. </p>

<p><span>It would be inadvisable treating patients
during sensitive periods, such as primordial germ cell development, because
these drugs inhibit the epigenetic machinery, and these changes might be
inherited to other generations as well.
