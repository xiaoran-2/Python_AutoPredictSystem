    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">At CpG islands DNA is normally unmethylated. In cancer DNA methylation of CpG is disrupted and instead of being unmethylated is hypermethylated, thus resulting in transcriptional silencing. This contributes to the development of cancer due to the transcriptional silencing of tumour suppressor genes and the promotion of oncogenes.<br />The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to maintain genomic integrity by silencing the genes and forming heterochromatin which is inactive. DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer as the CpG methylation of oncogene  promoters and parasitic repeat sequences is often decreased and the DNA is hypomethylated, contributing to cancer as the chromosomes become unstable through loss of imprinting and transposable elements are reactivated.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The paternal allele in the imprint control region is methylated so the protein CTCF cannot bind and the enhancers promote Igf2 expression. The maternal allele is unmethylated and bound by the protein CTCF which insulates Igf2 and H19 is expressed.<br />Imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm's tumour causing over expression of growth promoting genes and under expression of tumour suppressor genes. Disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer because over expression of H19 causes genomic instability and is linked to cell ploidy. If there is under expression of H19 and increased Igf2 expression this can promote oncogene growth.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the DNMT inhibitor class of epigenetic inhibitors. It is a hypomethylating drug. It reduces DNA methylation by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect as it allows the tumour suppressor genes to be expressed and reactivated.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is reversible and modifying the cancer cell epigenome with drugs can cause enduring effects. <br />A sensitive period is when epigenetic reprogramming occurs and also slow growth periods.<br />Sensitive periods of development occur at zygote formation, the formation of embryonic stem cells and also slow growth periods, in males from 9 to 12 years of age and in females from 8 to 10 years of age and around birth.<br />If patients are treated during sensitive periods their DNA could be damaged leading to mutations and disease in both the individual and also in future generations.</div>
