    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation of promoter regions is inversely correlated
with gene expression of the specific genes. But on CpG islands, which are found
in about 60% of promoters this is not the case. Since they have have a high CpG
density, so they are usually free of methylation. However, in cancer cells
promoter CpG islands generally are hypermethylated, which causes silencing of
the underlying gene. In cancer cells the main changes
in DNA methylation include a genome-wide loss and a regional gain of DNA
methylation which causes genomic instability,  deregulation of
tissue specific and imprinted genes and silencing of tumor
suppressor genes which generally control cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair by
hypermethylation of their promoter CpG islands.</p><p>Human repetitive elements are almost make half of the human genome and contain almost 50% of all CpG dinucleotides. Generally in adults the repeat regions are hypermethylated in order to maintenance of chromosome structure and genome integrity. Hypomethylation of repeat regions is generally seen in cancer cell lines. Also, it has been seen cancer cells exhibit widespread loss of intergenic DNA methylation with gain of methylation at many gene-associated CpG islands. These lead to overexpression of repetitive elements and intergenic regions in cancer cells.</p><p><br /></p><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Genomic imprinting, resulting in parent-of-origin-dependent gene expression, is mainly achieved by DNA methylation. IGF2 and H19, belonging to the same cluster of imprinted genes and regulated by ICR1, DMR2 and H19 promoter elements, play a major role in fetal/placental growth. These genes IGF2 and H19, are oppositely imprinted such that IGF2 is expressed from the paternal allele while H19 is expressed only from the maternal<div>allele. Methylation pattern of paternal allele affects the expression levels of IGF2 gene. But methylation pattern of maternal allele does not affect gene expression levels of IGF2 in fetal/placental growth. In Wilms tumors the maternal IGF2 imprint is relaxed such that the gene is expressed biallelically which has been found to be associated with undetectable or very low levels of H19 expression. The relaxation of IGF2 imprinting in Wilms tumors is also been found to be involved in a concomitant reversal in the patterns of DNA methylation of the maternally inherited IGF2 and H19 alleles.</div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to <span> DNA-demethylating agents</span> class of epigenetic inhibitor. It helps by demythylation of DNA, which can reduce the methylation on promotor regions of tumor suppressor genes, leading to help patient fight the growth of patient.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Since epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. So the epigenetic drugs which alter DNA methylation levels in cancer cells rejuvenate the cancer cell by erasing the DNA methylation , which is once erased do not return.<br /></p></div>
