    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are normally not methylated in normal cells, but they are usually methylated in cancer cells. As adding methyl groups is a silencing signal, when these CpGs islands are upstream tumor suppressor genes, if methylation silence them, it contributes to cancer (and it can be consider as one of the reasons that cause the disease, "one of the hits of Knudson hypothesis").<br />On the other hand, if we consider methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is the other way around, in normal cells they tend to be methylated, but in cancer cells we observe the loss of these methylation marks. This hypomethylation can cause different consecuences depending on where it occurs. This loss in repetitive elements and intergenic regions contributes to cancer because it generates genomic instability, and it can cause mutations such as inversions, reciprocal translocations, deletions... And cancer can have genomic and epigenomic causes.<br />We can also find hypomethylation in CpGs poor promoters, where the loss of methyl groups can activate genes that weren't supposed to be active, such as oncogenes (we see that in some cancers such as gastric or some glioma)</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In this case, the paternal allele is the one that express Igf2 because its imprint control region is methylated whereas the maternal allele express H19 and its imprint control region is not methylated. As it isn't methylated, CTCF binds there and make impossible the union of the enhancers to Igf2, so H19 is expressed instead.<br />When there's an hypermethylation and the maternal allele imprint control region gets methylated, its Igf2 also express, so the dosis is twice that of a normal cell. This gene (Igf2) is associated with growth promotion, so there's more growth that it should be, and it can lead to a cancer, such as Wilm's tumour, a very common kid's kidney tumour. In this case, both alleles are expressed, so there is an overdose of the product of Igf2.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a medicine that belongs to DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, it is a nucleoside analog that gets incorporated to the DNA sequence, during replication and when the DNA methyltransferase binds to it, it gets incarcerated so it can't do its function of adding methyl groups anymore. So the methylation can no longer take place and the silencing of tumor suppressing genes won't exist so these genes will be able to perform its role of avoiding tumors.<br />The problem can be than Decitabine gets incorporated to all replicating cells, not only cancer cells but all, however, this is used in old patients when doctors are more worried about giving them a good quality and longer life expectancy than in the side effects.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Changes in the epigenome can be transgenerational inheritable, and they are mytotically inheritable, so a change in early stages can be in lots of tissues of the grown up.<br />Changes are particularly important during the sensitive periods, during the development of the early embryo (until it gets to blatocyst more or less) and when the primordial germ cells are developing in the fetus. So if we treat a pregnant mother for example, it doesn't affect only her but the incoming generation, and the side effect could be affordable for an adult but not for a new developing body.<br />Drugs that can alter the DNA methylation can have lasting effects because the changes they produce are mytotically inheritable or like in the article, they can help to better responses to the standard treatments with normal chemotherapy. That's why new studies are being perform with combinations of epigenetic drugs and chemotherapeutic drugs.</div>
