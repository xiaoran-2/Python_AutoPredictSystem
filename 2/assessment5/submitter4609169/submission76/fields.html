    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an important regulator of gene transcription, and its role in carcinogenesis has been a topic of considerable                     interest in the last few years. Alterations in DNA methylation are common in a variety of tumors as well as in development. However, global hypomethylation has also been recognized                     as a cause of oncogenesis. New information concerning the mechanism of methylation and its control has led to the discovery                     of many regulatory proteins and enzymes. The contribution of dietary folate and methylene terahydrofolate reductase polymorphisms                     to methylation patterns in normal and cancer tissues is under intense investigation. As methylation occurs early and can be                     detected in body fluids, it may be of potential use in early detection of tumors and for determining the prognosis. Because                     DNA methylation is reversible, drugs like 5′-azacytidine, decitabine, and histone deacetylase inhibitors are being used to                     treat a variety of tumors. Novel demethylating agents such as antisense.</p><p>DNA methylation is a covalent chemical modification, resulting in the addition of a methyl (CH3) group at the carbon 5 position                     of the cytosine ring. Even though most cytosine methylation occurs in the sequence context 5′CG3′ (also called the CpG dinucleotide).Therefore the CpG dinucleotide                     should occur with a frequency of approximately 6%. However, the actual presence is only 5% to 10% of its predicted frequency.This CpG suppression may be related to the hypermutability of methylated cytosine.In contrast to the rest of the genome, smaller regions of DNA, called CpG islands,have distinctive properties. These regions are unmethylated, GC rich (60%), have a ratio of                     CpG to GpC of at least 0.6, and thus do not show any suppression of the frequency of the dinucleotide CpG.Approximately half of all the genes in humans have CpG islands,and these are present on both housekeeping genes and genes with tissue-specific patterns of expression.</p><p></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span><span><span></span></span></span><p>In a cell around the H19/Igf2 locus we ordinarily see the methylation of the paternal allele at the</p><p>
</p><p>ICR, and no methylation for the maternal allele. The CTCF complex binds to the allele on the</p><p>
</p><p>maternal strand and the downstream enhancers act on H19 as a result. The CTCF complex</p><p>
</p><p>does not bind to the paternal allele due to the methyl marks, which leads to silencing of the H19</p><p>
</p><p>gene as the enhancers instead drive expression of Igf2. Thus, in a regular cell you observe a</p><p>
</p><p>normal dose of both H19 from maternal strand, and Igf2 from paternal strand. However, when</p><p>
</p><p>this ICR becomes hypermethylated, both strands appear to be of paternal origin and get</p><p>
</p><p>expressed as such. That is, the system gets a double dose of (growthpromoting) Igf2 (as well as no dose of H19). This is associated with Wilm's tumour.</p><p></p><p></p><p><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span></span><p>Decitabine belongs to a class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, and thus contributes to</p><p> hypomethylation of DNA. This turns out to be particularly useful in treating myelodysplatic syndrome </p><p>(conditions under which the bone marrow produces deformed blood cells), which is aprecursor of </p><p>acute myelogenous leukemia. In case of Decitabine, the antitumour effect has been linked to </p><p>reactivation of epigenetically silenced tumor supressor genes, induced by thehypothemylation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span></span><p>DNA methylation is a particularly attractive form of regulation to target in treatments because it</p>
<p>can be manipulated once, and enduring effects are ensured as the DNA methyltransferase</p>
<p>enzymes preserve methyl marks during mitosis. However, these global interventions may</p>
<p>interfere with ordinary functioning of the system, especially during critical periods periods</p>
<p>of time where extensive epigenetic reprogramming occurs. In particular, it would be inadvisable to</p>
<p>prescribe these treatments to pregnant mothers (including a few months before conception) as</p>
<p>a lot of reprogramming happens in early child development as well as during the formation of </p><span></span><p></p><span></span><p></p><span></span><p></p><p>gametes (both male and female).</p></div>
