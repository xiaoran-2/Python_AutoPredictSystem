    <h1>Submission 527 from Anon (session_user_id: 0821b1a074ef5487c7a80b69edf12c21888e7537)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. Exsposure to decitabine leads to lack of dnmt, which results to passive DNA hypomethylation, through the DNA replication in the cell division process. DNA hypomethylation can result to upregulation of anti-tumour genes expression. This can be effective within tumours driven by tumour supressor hypermethylation. It is currently approved for treatment of <span>myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cell CpG islands are normally unmethylated, when intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated. Cancer can disrupt both pathways, introducing hypermethylation of CpG islands and CpG island shores; and genome-wide hypomethylation.<br />Hypermethylation of CpG islands usually associated with genes supression, which provokes tumour growth in case of silenced tumour supressor genes. Hypomethilation of intergenic regions and genome in general, leads to genomic instability and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer by upregulating the expession of specific genes, while  silencing other genes.<br />In normal cell H19/lgf2 cluster expressed differentelly for maternal and paternal alleles:<br />In paternal allele ICR is methylated, therefore H19 is silenced and Igf2 is expressed.<br />Maternal allele, on a contrary, contains unmethylated ICR, which leads to H19 expression and Igf2 silencing.<br />In Wilm's tumour cells, both maternal and paternal alleles have methylation on its ICR. As a result, both alleles have silenced H19 and expressed Igf2 gene, providing the cell with double dosage of Igf2. Igf2 has growth-regulating activity (IGF stands for "Insulin like Growth Factor"). Though Igf2 overexpression itself seems to be not lethal (at least in mice), it can, in combination with other factors, contribute to tumour development and growth. <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, i.e. it is preserved through the normal lifespan of somatic cells and the process of cell division. This means, that changes made to the epigenome during epigenetic drug exposure can persist beyond the period of drug treatment.<br />There are two "sensitive" periods in organism development process, when epigenome goes through the extensive reprogramming process, which removes most of methylation marks, and re-establish them later. Specifically, it happens in the early embrio development phase, and in the primordial germ cell development process. Any interference to this reprogramming process can lead to very serious outcome for the embrio, even death. It also could affect the second generation (grandchildren), if disruption were made during the primordial germ cell development. <br />Therefore, epigenetic drugs treatment would be inadvisible during pregnancy and pre-fertilisation period (probably for both: female and male). Also, such kind of treatment should be very conscious for the patients of a young age, since any alteration of epigenome will probably be kept through their life, and can cause severe damage on a long term perspective.<br /></div>
