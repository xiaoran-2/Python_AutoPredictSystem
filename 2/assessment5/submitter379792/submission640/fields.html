    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Decitabine may be used to treat cancer by de-methylating over-methylated areas, and could also possibly result in cell death, thus slowing down or stopping the tumor, or even killing it outright. Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, and so when applied to over-methylated DNA, it will help bring methylation levels back down to normal. When applied to DNA with more normal methylation levels, it will strip off the methylation, leaving it open to possible death. Patients who were treated with Decitabine or other DNA-demethylating agents also showed better responses to conventional treatments, making this a good looking option for people with otherwise low expected outcomes.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In cancer cells, in general, CpG islands are more likely to be methylated, and intergenic regions and repetitive elements are more likely to be un-methylated. Normally, CpG islands are mostly un-methylated. Methylation at CpG islands causes gene silencing. For example, in several cancer types, one of the silenced genes is the tumor suppresser gene. As you can guess from the name, it's one of the genes that is supposed to stop this sort of thing from happening. Kinda loses its purpose after it's silenced.<br /><br />As for the intergenic regions, they are normally methylated, to try to stop unwanted transcription. For example, a normal gene that's expressed 'downstream,' and an upstream promoter downstream from the first gene. If the second promoter starts transcribing, then the gene starts being transcribed, then the two enzymes will run into each other, and the gene won't be properly expressed. The repetitive elements on the other hand, try to either cut and paste or copy and paste themselves into other areas of the genome. They also have a strong promoter on the other end, pointing away from the RE, which causes downstream genes to be expressed no matter what, unless the promoter is methylated. In cancer, these areas are also often un-methylated, causing "jumping" genes, and unnatural gene expression near these repeats.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">When parental imprinting gets disrupted, it can cause many problems. One such problem is receiving two copies of the same gene or genome segment. Specifically, in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, and Wilm's tumor, this is due to having two paternal-like alleles at the H19/Igf2 cluster, and at Kcnq1. Kcnq1 is a 'tumor suppressor' gene, which means that it regulates the growth of the cell. It is only expressed from the maternal strand, not the paternal one. Igf2 on the other hand, is a growth gene. It creates growth hormones that, when gone unchecked, can create mass growth, and cancer. Igf2 is only expressed from the <em>paternal</em> strand. Combine all three of those facts, and you get two paternal strands, with no Kcnq1 (suppressor) expression, and double the Igf2 (growth hormone) expression, which can easily lead to cancerous growths.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The main way for DNA methylation to last beyond the period of drug treatment is that the change in methylation is mitotically inheritable. Meaning that it gets preserved between cell generations. An example of this is X-inactivation; once established, X-inactivation is "saved" between cell generations, and it's this that produces the calico appearance in some female cats.<br /><br />You should never change anything epigenetically when the epigenetic marks are in a 'sensitive period.' For example: in the pre-implantation and primordial germ cell (egg/sperm) development, or during childhood in rats, when the mother's licking is causing epigenetic changes. Messing with epigenetics during that time is really dangerous, because the organism doesn't know what the "correct" state is yet. Changing anything during these periods could have disastrous consequences.</div>
