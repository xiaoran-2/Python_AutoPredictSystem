    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation helps X inactivation, chromatin formation and imprinting
but in CpG islands, poor in methylation, it is correlated with gene expression
(low methylation = low expression).<span><br />
In
cancer CpG islands are hypermethylated that causes silencing of the underlying
genes. More precisely CGIs are hypermethylated depending on the type of tumour but progress with time and age. It's often correlated with a decrease of 5mC<br />The
problem is that these under expressed genes are tumor suppressor genes. This
contributes to the arising of cancers due to the loss of their control. According to Knudson hypotheses cancer is the result not only of the loss of one loss of these tumour suppressor gene but of multiple hits to DNA.<br /><span>Repetitive
elements such as LINEs and SINEs or intergenic regions are highly methylated in normal cells.
This methylation helps to stabilize the genome by silencing the genomic instability (illegitimate recombinations, activation of repeats and transpositions...) into heterochromatin. <br /> On the contrary cancer cells are hypomethylated.</span>This could lead to an activation of the promoters of these genes and transcriptional aberrations.<br />Weber
(2010) showed that global hypomethylation in cells may trigger the activation
of such element expression which may cause activation of some proto-oncogenes.
As an example LINEs methylation patterns can be analyzed to study the degree
carcinogenesis. Moreover in mice,</span>
<i>Dnmt1</i>
(DNA methylatransferase I) controls methylation. When <i>Dnmt1</i> is deleted, the induced h<span>ypomethylation leads to genomic instability. Similarly,  inactive variants of <i>DNMT3B </i>gene in humans leads to a genomic instability, characteristic of ICF (immunodeficiency and cranio-facial defects) syndrom.</span><span><br /></span></p><p><span>Combination of hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes and hypomethylation of intergene regions and repeat sequences highly favors tumorigenesis.<br /></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A better understanding of the variability of heritable phenotypes in cancer involves epigenetic mechanisms.<br />The insulin-like growth factor-2 (Igf2)-H19 gene on chromosome 11 codes for a member of the insulin family of polypeptide growth factors, which are involved in development and growth.<br />Non-coding mRNA obtained by transcription of H19 is a precursor of
several microRNAs that inhibits cell proliferation. Methylation of the paternal chromosome (paternally imprinted) and a lack of methylation on
the maternal chromosome, regulates expression of both of these genes. More precisily Igf2 is transcribed only from the paternal chromosome, DNA methylation blocking ICR and expression of H19. H19 is only expressed from the
maternal chromosome: by the bind of CTCF on the unmethylated region stimulating enhancers and expression of H19 but inhibiting expression of Igf2. <br />Furthermore, recent evidence indicates that
erasure of imprinting (hypomethylation) of the Igf2-H19 locus on both
chromosomes, which leads to downregulation of Igf2 and upregulation of H19
expression, plays an important role in regulating quiescence of pluripotent
stem cells in adult. In contrast,in Wilm's tumour, hypermethylation of this locus on both chromosomes (loss
of imprinting) results in Igf2 overexpression ("double dose") and is observed in several
others malignancies.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is DNA-demethylating agent (hypomethylating agent) and belongs to the DNMTi family (DNA methyltransferase inhibitors).<br />It is thought to induce antineoplastic activity via two mechanisms:<br /> - inhibition of DNA methylation: by blocking methyltransferase activity at low doses, causing hypomethylation of DNA<br />- direct cytotoxicity in higher doses in haemotological malignancies in the bone marrow through its incorporation into DNA and RNA at high doses, resulting in cell death. <br />Decitabine, due to its structural conformation close to a nucleic base is integrated into the DNA. Then the DNMT1 bind this molecule to copy the methylation to the other strand. Once bound the methyl transferase is irreversibly stuck and can't be released. DNMT1 is more active during cell replication and more in cancer. This could explain a part of efficiency of this drug against tumours. Even if the whole mechanism is still unclear, this drug is particulary efficient in myelodysplastic syndrom patients.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can influence other genes such as those implicated in immunomodulation, signaling pathways, lineage commitment but also it can favor the reexpression of tumor suppressor genes. <span> As an example low doses of AZA and DAC lead to the reexpression of genes silenced by aberrant DNA methylation. <br /></span>The sensitive period for a such therapy is about all related to DNA epigenomics reprogramming: for example in female during pregnancy (there is an active remodelling of epigenetic marks during differentiation) or in male during preconception.<br />During germ cell development: marks on paternal and maternal genomes are cleared and reset. For the imprinted genes the paternal and maternal imprints are removed and reset.<br />During pre-implantation development the paternal and maternal genomes are reset too but imprinted genes maintain their specific marks form the germ cells.<br />Treating patients during these periods could lead to :<br /> - in pregnant female, congenital malformations<br /> - in male, during preconception, it may increase embryofetal loss in their mated female.<br />More generally you can have imprinting disorders.<br />And a lot of side effects not yet explored...</div>
