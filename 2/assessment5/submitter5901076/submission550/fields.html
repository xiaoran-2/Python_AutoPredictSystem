    <h1>Submission 550 from Anon (session_user_id: 4f6cff4e61697900e9380dd233d6bf75e17f1537)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1. DNA methylation at CpG islands would suppress gene expression.</p><p>2. CpG islands are usually un-methylated in normal cells. But they are methylated in cancer cells.</p><p>3. methylated CpG islands leads to gene silencing and silencing of tumor-suppression genes can lead to cancer formation.</p><p>4. DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements can help maintain genome stability.</p><p>5. In cancer, DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is lost (no methylation in those regions).</p><p>6. Lost of methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements would cause genome instability, leading to disruption of normal gene expression pattern. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1. ICR is methylated on the paternal allele and this methylation prevents CTCF binding to the ICR. Then methylation can spread to H19. Downstream enhancer therefore works on the alternative target- Igf2.</p><p>2. ICR is not methylated on the maternal allele and CTCF can bind to ICR. H19 is also not methylated. Downstream enhancer works on H19 instead of Igf2.</p><p>3. ICR of the maternal allele is methylated ( acts like paternal allele) in Wilm's tumor.</p><p>4. Both maternal and paternal alleles are methylated and leading to double doses of Igf2 expression and hence more cell growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1. Decitabine is DNMT inhibitor (DNA methyltransferase).</p><p>2. Decitabine is nucleoside analog. After incorporation into DNA, when DNMT comes to add methyl group and gets stuck at the site since the binding of DNMT to Decitabine is irreversible.</p><p>3. Decitabine can decrease methylation by binding to DNMT irreversibly. Hence it is effective to treat tumors with hypermethylation (on tumor suppressor genes).</p><p><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1. Because DNA methylation is mitotically inheritable. Once a cell losts the methylation at a specific site, cells divided from it will still have no methylation at that particular site.</p><p>2. A sensitive period is the time when epigenetic marks are erased and re-established.</p><p>3. early embryonic development and germ cell development (two main periods).</p><p>4. since during sensitive periods, treating patients with epigenetic modification drugs can affect the epigenetic marks globally.</p></div>
