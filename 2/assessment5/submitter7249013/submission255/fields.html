    <div class="field-value">In normal cells the CpG islands are hypomethylated but the intergenic regions, repetitive elements and intragenic regions are hypermethylated. In cancer cells the level of methylation decreases as cells progress from normal state to metastatic state whereas the methyltion of CpG islands increases. <br /><br />DNA methylation is brought about by the enzyme DNA methyl transferase and as it is mitotically heritable it is passed onto the daughter cells. The methylation of DNA in intragenic and intergenic regions is needed to maintain genomic stability. It results in silencing of the cryptic transcription sites or splice sites and chromosomal abnormalities like duplication, insertion, deletion and translocation of chromosomes will not take place. <br /><br />In cancer the hypermethylation in the CpG islands of promoters of tumor suppressor genes leads to silencing of the genes leading to cancer. In case of CpG poor promoters hypomethylation will cause activation of genes and is undesirable in oncogenes as it leads to cancer. There is also hypermethylation of multiple genes -CIMP and CpG island shores. In cancer cells the genomic instability will be caused by either insertion, deletion, duplication and translocation of chromosome. <br /><br />In case of repetitive elements, the normal cells have CpG islands that are methylated. The repetitive elements flank the pol and gag proteins. The proteins cause transposition of the repeats to other sites in the genome causing genomic instability but is avoided in normal cells due to methylation. The transcription of strong promoters reading into the neighbouring genes and disrupting them is also avoided in normal cells. The methylated Cytosine because of deamination will result in thymine and prevent transposition of repeats. Also recombination of similar repeats on realignment is avoided due to methylation. However all these undesirable changes which are not seen in normal tissues are seen in cancer. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In imprinting there is expression of the allele derived either form the mother or the father. In cancer the loss of imprinting results in both alleles being expressed or silenced and this depends on the methylation status and the function of the gene containing the imprint control region. <br /><br />In the Igf2/H19 cluster, the paternal allele has an imprint control region which is methylated. Therefore CTCF protein will not bind to the imprint control region and hence the enhancer will act on Igf2 leading to its expression. In the maternal allele the CTCF can bind to the unmethylated imprint control region and the enhancer acts on H19 causing its expression and silencing of Igf2. <br /><br />In cancer, loss of imprinting causes hypermethylation of the imprint control region on both the alleles. Thus there will be expression of Igf2 from both alleles. Igf2 is a growth promoting gene and is seen in Wilms tumor which is a childhood kidney tumor. It occurs as an early event in preneoplastic tissue before it can be considered as a frank tumor. This suggests that methylation events at the imprint control regions may be early events in tumerogenesis.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a class of drug that inhibits DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) and are known as DNMTi. It is approved by the FDA and is among the first which targets the epigenetic changes in the genome. It is used in cases of myelodysplastic syndrome that has progressed to acute myeloid leukemia. This drug is a nucleoside analogue and hence can enter the DNA on replication. DNMT1 binds irreversibly to the nucleotide when it comes to the daughter strand to pass on the methylation mark and so action of the inhibitors is replication dependent. The drug is given in a dose that causes DNA demethylation i.e. effective on cancer and has no toxic side effects and their action on normal cells will be less. Other than demethylation presently it is not known if there is any other mechanism involved. <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">A sensitive period is where the genome is subject to major epigenetic reprogramming. This occurs during early embryonic development and primordial germ cell development. The methylation marks present in the sperm and egg are removed on fertilization till it forms a blastocyst (preimplantation period). It then undergoes reprogramming and is maintained in the somatic cells  to ensure totipotency. At the time of formation of sperm and egg it again undergoes reprogramming. <br /><br />Methylation is established and 
maintained by DNA methyltranferases 1, 3a and 3b and is essential for 
genomic stability, telomere length, embryogenesis, development, and 
predetermined gene expression states. Epigenetic changes are easier to reverse than the mutations and are passed onto the 
daughter cells till they are effectively erased. Once erased 
they will not return back. The drugs therefore effect changes which stop the cancer growth but not kill normal cells. This was seen in the experiment using GSK2816126 which is known to reduce the methylation mark on histone proteins. Treatment in the sensitive period would be inadvisable as the treatment would be ineffective or lead to undesirable changes. It would interefere witn the reprogramming and may thus affect the geentic stability and thereby normal development of cells.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
