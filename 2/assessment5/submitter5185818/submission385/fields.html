    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism in which a methyl group is added mainly in the C5 position of cytosine. It is found in greater amount in three different types of regions within the genome: CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements. <br />Firstly,<strong> CpG islands</strong> are found in promoter regions and their methylation is linked with silencing of gene expression. In normal cells most CpG islands are kept free of methylation, but CpG islands of cancer cells are hypermethylated. As a result many genes that can act as tumour suppressors are not expressed in cancer cells and that gives them an extra advantage to proliferate uncontrollably. For example, in many colorectal tumours, the mismatch repair gene MLH1 is silenced due to DNA methylation of its promoter. In that way, genetic mutations can arise more easily in these cells, because the efficiency of mismatch repair system is diminished.<br />On the other hand, <strong>intergenic regions</strong> and <strong>repetitve elements</strong> tend to be hypermethylated in normal cells and DNA methylation in these regions keeps the chromatin compact (heterochromatin), prevents transposition and recombination and silences the expression of the repetitve elements. All these events contribute to the genomic stability in normal cells. However, in cancer cells these regions are hypomethylated and abnormal karyotypes can be found because of the genomic instability. In other words, reciprocal translocations, deletions or insertions can be detected in the chromosomes. Also, many genes can be activated or disrupted as a result of the unpackaging of chromatin, the activation of cryptic promoters or the fusion with the promoter of a repetitive element. Finally, the creation of new oncogenes via fusion can also contibute to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In H19/Igf2 locus, an <strong>insulator-mediated imprinting</strong> is found. <strong>In the paternal allele</strong>, the Imprinting Control Region (ICR) is methylated and consequently the insulator CTCF cannot bind at it. Also, H19 is methylated and as a result the enhancers access better the Igf2 gene enhancing its expression. <strong>In the maternal allele</strong>, ICR is unmethylated and bound with CTCF and also H19 is unmethylated. Hence, in the maternal allele the enhancers cannot access Igf2 due to the presence of the insulator and Igf2 is not expressed.<br /><strong>In Wilm's tumour</strong> the maternal allele is found methylated in the ICR and in the H19 locus. Actually, the maternal allele becomes similar epigenetically to the paternal allele and as a result CTCF cannot bind neither the maternal nor the paternal ICR and Igf2 is expressed in double levels in Wilm's tumour cells. But, Igf2 is a protein similar to insuline that has mitogenic activities and can promote cell growth, especially in early age. As a result, the increased levels of Igf2 promote the uncontrollable proliferation of the cells and favour their turning into malignant cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><strong>Decitabine</strong> is an epigenetic drug that can be used against certain types of cancer, like MDS and AML. It belongs in the class of DNA Methyl Transferases inhibitors (<strong>DNMT i</strong>) and it can irreversibly block the action of DNMTs after it is incorporated in DNA within replication. By inhibiting DNMTs, decitabine reduces DNA methylation that it is found within the genome of cancer cells. This is quite important for the therapy of cancer types where CpG island hypermethylation is a poor indicator for the tumourigenicity. In those cancer types (like MDS), the inhibition of DNMTs probably restores the methylation pattern in the CpG islands of many promoters and helps in the expression of essential tumour suppressor genes, that where previously silenced because of the CGI hypermethylation. This whole action can hinder cancer cells from further growing.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><b>DNA methylation</b> is a reversible process that is mitotically heritable. So once it is restored, it can be maintained for many generations. That's why drugs that alter DNA methylation can have lasting effects beyond the period of treatment.<br /><b>Sensitive period</b> is a period where cell types are developping and establishing their epigenetic marks (reprogramming). In this period, the epigenome of these cells is more susceptible to changes by environmental influences. There are two main sensitive periods within lifetime: <br />a] early embryonic development (after the formation of zygote) and<br />b] primordial germ cell development<br />Epigenetic drugs are distributed throughout the body system and thus their use should be made with <strong>caution</strong> in people who have cells that are in sensitive periods. For example, epigenetic drugs should not been given in young patients that have still developping germ cells or in pregnant women. In those cases, epigenetic drugs can alter the epigenome of the germ cells or the embryo respectively and may lead to stable mitocally heritable alterations. These alterations can affect the expression of key-genes and cause detrimentous effects (e.g. cancer) in the embryo that will arise from the germ cells or that is already implanted in the mother.</div>
