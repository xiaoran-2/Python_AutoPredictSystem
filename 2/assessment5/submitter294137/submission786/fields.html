    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell CpG islands are usually not methylated while in cancer cells CpG islands are more likely to be methylated. CpG islands are the location of tumor suppressant genes. When CpG islands are methylated in cancer those tumor suppressing genes are silenced and can, thus, not code for proteins that are important for the normal functioning of a tumor-free cell.<br />Intergenenic regions are usually methylated in a normal cell. In cancer cells they are less likely to be methylated. This leads to genomic instability like illegitimate recombination, activation of repeats and transposition, or activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the paternal allele the imprint control region will be methylated and the methylation will spread to H19 which will silence the H19 promoter. With H19 silenced, the enhancers can access and activate expression of lgf2. In a normal cell the maternal allele will show an unmethylated imprint control region which will allow the CTCF protein to bind to it. This will block the methylation of the H19 promoter. Various enhancers will act on CTCF and H19. CTCF will insulate lgf2 from the enhancers and lgf2 will not be expressed. <br />Patients with Wilm's tumor may suffer from Beckwidth-Wiedeman Syndrom, where the maternal allele will act like a paternal allele. In both alleles the imprint control region will be methylated, the H19 promoter will be silenced and lgf2 will be over-expressed. This overexpression of lgf2 will lead to fetal and post-natal overgrowth, including tumor growth.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a <span>DNA-demethylating drug, i.e., it removes DNA methylation by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. By doing so it can clear DNA methylation on CpG islands which silences tumor suppressant genes in cancer cells, thus, restoring cells to their normal function. </span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, i.e., the methylation marks are usually passed on from a somatic cells to its daughter cells during cell division. There are two sensitive periods of development were methylation marks are cleared and re-set: during early embryonic development and during primordial germ cell development. Therefore, treating pregnant patients with drugs that alter DNA methylation can disrupt the process of clearing and resetting of methylation marks in the embryo and in the embryo's primordial germ cells. Thus, the treatment may not only impact the patient but also the embryo and any potential offsprings in the third generation.</div>
