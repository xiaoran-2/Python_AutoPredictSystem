    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell two forms of
methylation are mostly seen. The CpG islands are usually unmethylated and this
form allows them to successfully act in regulatory regions, while other areas
including intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated. Their
heavy methylation accompanied by heterochromization stops these areas from
recombination.</p>

<p>In cancer cells DNA-methylation is
disrupted. The CpG islands become methylated (hypermethylation can make CpG rich
sites called CIMP or CpG island methylator phenotype), as a result a
transcriptional silencing of their underlying genes occurs because a
hypermethylated promoter is rarely expressed. These silenced genes that are
inherited by daughter cells during mitotic division, include tumour suppressor genes,
that once silenced can no longer control cellular actions like DNA repair, cell
cycles and apoptosis, causing cellular division to get out of control. All
other areas including intergenic regions and repetitive elements switch places
with CpG islands in terms of methylation and become hypomethylated. Losing
their methylation can cause them to misalign, and they might become unreadable
as well as they are no longer densely packed into heterochromatin. Another
effect is the repetitive elements can become active as a result of
hypomethylation and start making copies of themselves and moving around the
genome, which can then lead to the activation of neighbouring genes (transcriptional
aberrations) or possible change in codes with unwanted consequences where they
insert themselves in different areas. </p>

<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive
elements hypomethylation (starts earlier) can cause genomic chromosomal
instability (deletions, reciprocal translocations and insertions) and the
deregulation of tissue specific genes and loss of imprinting, while CpG islands
hypermethylation (can be secondary) can stop tumour suppressor genes from
working (hypermethylation is linked to promotors). The result can be a change
from normal tissue to hyperplasia, then neoplasia and finally invasive tissue
because of methylation at CpG islands.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Hypermethylation
or hypomethylation of imprinting control regions (ICRs)
can cause a loss of imprinting control so both parental alleles are
expressed or silenced. The genes controlled in this
way are usually growth promoting and the resulting extra growth can lead to
tumour-genesis.</p>

<p>In the H19/Igf2 cluster of a normal cell, in the paternal allele the
ICR is methylated and CTCF can’t bind to the insulator,therefore
the enhancers will act on Igf2 (H19 is silent.) The
maternal allele is unmethylated and CTCF binds to the insulator, therefore the
enhancers will act on H19 (Igf2 stays silent).</p>

<p>If a loss of imprinting happens, hypermethylation of
the ICR occurs, the maternal imprint control will also be methylated
and CTCF can’t bind to that either. Now the enhancers will
act on Igf2 in both parental alleles, and H19 will stay silent. When
the enhancers only act on both Igf2s , it will have a double dosage
compared to normal cells, and as such genes are growth promoting it will cause an extra growth named Wilm’s tumour.</p>

<p>A
loss of imprinting is an early event and mostly identified in pre-neoplastic
tissues (before the tissue becomes a tumour). Therefore, ICR changes might be
early events in tumour-genesis.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an enzymatic epigenetic
regulator that acts as a DNA Methyl Transferase inhibitor. It is known as a
hypomethylating agent used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome that has
progressed to acute myelogenous leukemia. </p>

<p>Decitabine causes hypomethylation of
DNA. When used in low doses it acts as a nucleoside analog and places itself in
the DNA when it’s being replicated. Now it has become part of the DNA it is copied.
When DNA methyl transferase attaches itself to the analog incorporated in the
DNA to replicate it, it gets stuck and can’t separate and becomes blocked.
Changing the methylation by unmethylating it can cause an anti-tumour effect by
reactivating epigenetically silenced tumour suppressor genes as seen in
laboratory tests. In humans it could have epigenetic alterations and induce
apoptosis. As with epigenetic changes it is continued in daughter cell after
division and because cancer cells divide faster, it affects them more.<br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA-methylation is an epigenetic change and like
all epigenetic changes can be passed to daughter cells after mitotic division
until they are actively erased, causing a longer affect even after finishing
the drugs. Such a long term effect can be seen as long as the cells continue to
divide. As cancer cells are known to divide faster than normal cells they will
be more affected. However, there are periods that are more sensitive to such
effects (compared to less sensitive ones) where extensive epigenetic
reprogramming is taking place. Early embryonic development and germ cell development
are critical periods of epigenetic inheritance. Also, when particular cell
types or organs undergo development and establish their future epigenetic marks
a sensitive period occurs. Each organ has different stages of development and
afterwards some form of remodeling in development, all these periods are
sensitive. Mostly in children/infants (and occasionally younger adults) undergoing development, cells will be undergoing faster division. Therefore, drugs might affect more normal cells through
mitotic division and disrupt normal DNA-methylation in healthy cells. Any
form of disruption might activate silenced genes, lead to chromosomal
instability, the deregulation of tissue-specific genes and loss of imprinting
or stop tumour-suppressor genes from working.</p>
