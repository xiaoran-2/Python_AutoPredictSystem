    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation is
silencing a gene, resulting in the gene’s inactive or some other gene’s active,
as the mehtylated gene may be a noise or inhibitor. CpG
island of oncogene is hypermethylated or CpG island of tumor suppressor is
hypomethylated. If CpG island of tumor suppressor gene is
hypermethalated, the cell will divide rapidly and frequently, making it a tumor
cell. If CpG island of oncogeng is hypomethylated, the chromosome may be
unstable and have abnormal division, resulting a tumor cell. DNA methylation in intergenic regions makes
the gene stable, make sure there is only 1 derection in transcription, and silencing
useless splice site. In repetitive elements, it makes the genome integrity as
it silencing some repeats to prevent transcription, prevent activating strong
promoters, and prevent wrong recombination. In cancer, hypomethylation in intergenic
regions contribute to deletion, insertion, and recipracal translocation. Hypermethylation
in repetitive elements may activate strong promoters of oncogene and makes the
gene unstable.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In paternal allele, inprinted control
region is methylated, there is no CTCF clustered, resulting methylation spread
to H19, so the enhancer downstream is activating Igf2 rather than H19. In maternal allele, inprinted control
region is not methylated, so it can cluster CTCF, an insulator protein which
insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. So the promoter downstream activate
H19. When inprinted control region of maternal
allele is mehtylated, maternal allele activate Igf2 like the paternal one, double
the dose of Igf2 in cell. Igf2 can promote growth, and too much growth makes
Wilm’s tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to 5hmC. Decitabine lower the level of methylation
on CpG island. It can act as DNA glycosylases, decrease
level of 5mC, passive demethlation. It may cluster protein such as CTCF , cohesion
or chromatin to promoter or enhancer. At low dose, it can bind to DNA methyltransferase and make it inactive. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation is inheritable.  After duplication, the DNA strain is semi-methylated.
Then DNMT1 bind to the strain and lay down methylation on the other stran to maintain
methylation. Sensitive period is the time when organism has a low inprinting
mark level, cleared previous inactivation to have 2 activated X chromosomes, including
inner cell mass in pre-implantation phase, , and primordial germ cells. Treating
patients during sensitive period may change maternal or paternal print or other
epigenetic mark, resulting a inheritable change or a genetic change or cancer,
these changes are unpredictable and dangerous, so the treatment would be
inadvisable.</span></p></div>
