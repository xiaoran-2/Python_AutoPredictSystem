    <h1>Submission 310 from Anon (session_user_id: 7d4c546f522cc131cae0d881144e61df80fda954)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-methyl-transferase inhibitor (DNMTi) , it is a nucleoside analogue which, after being incorporated into the tumor cell DNA, irreversibly binds DNMTs which then cannot be released to continue methylating other parts of the DNA. <br />As it requires incorporation into the cell's DNA, Decitabine is replication dependent.. The irreversible binding of the DNMT would mean overall hypomethylation of the tumor cells' DNA, which in tumors that rely on tumor suppression gene hypermethylation and therefore silencing of the tumor suppressor, would mean better functioning of the tumor suppressor gene and therefore suppression of the tumor.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNMTi are nucleoside analogues which will be incorporated in all dividing cells of the body. The therapeutic principle for all chemotherapeutic agents in cancer is that the cancer cells are dividing faster and therefore incorporate more of the nucleoside analogues than other cells in the organism. However, other relatively rapidly dividing cells such as skin, gut or indeed, in males, germ cells, will also have DNMT nucleosides incorporated in their DNA and therefore have their methylation status altered.. Sensitive periods include the clearing of epigenetic markers in primordial germ cells and also, after fertilisatin, in the period leading from fertilisation to the blastocyst stage. This would mean that the re-establishment of epigenetic markers in those phases can be altered by the presence of DNMTi, this would happen in very early pregnancy, often before the woman patient would be aware of her pregnancy, caution would therefore have to be applied even pre-conceptual. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Methylation of the C5 position of Cytosine in promoter regions usually leads to decreased function of the promoter. In promoters containing CpG islands, the cytosines tend to be kept free of methylation, regardless of their activity state. In cancer cell, however, the CpG regions are often found to be hypermethylated, which may cause silencing of the gene. If that promoter promotes the expression of a tumor suppressor gene,the suppressor does not work and the tumor cells can now divide uncontrolled.<br />Intergenic methylation is found in satellite repeats, for example in telomeres, and in retroviral insertion materials. This would lead to suppression of transcription of these sequences but the expression of such sequences due to hypomethylation may lead to alternative starting sites, inhibition of antisense transcription and  RNA splicing. This may then lead to overexpression of cell division promoters or, alternatively, to the silencing of promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">On the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated, while the opposite is true for the maternal allele. this means that there is paternal imprinting. The methylation of the the paternal ICR prevents the insulator protein CTCF from binding to the ICR on the paternal allele. On this allele there is also hetrochromatine spreading of methylation which silences the H19 locus further downstream on the paternal allele. This in turn enable the Igf2 enhancers even further downstream to be expressed and the products can now bind to the Igf2 gene itself and promote its expression.<br />On the maternal allele the CTCF  binds to the unmethylated ICR which insulates the Igf2 locus from the enhancers downstream. Because the enhancer products can now not bind to the Igf2 locus, they instead enhance the expression of the H19 locus which on the maternal allele is also unmethylated which is a source of a lncRNA. If the ICR on the maternal allele is also imprinted, the CTCF can't bind and the maternal Igf2 locus becomes activated and a double dose of Igf2 is produced. As  the product of this gene is a growth factor, tumors can be promoted, in particular Wilms tumor in children.,</div>
