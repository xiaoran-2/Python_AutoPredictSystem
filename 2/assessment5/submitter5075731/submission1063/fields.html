    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are gene-promotor regions which controls the expression of a gene. If they are methylated then the promoted gene would be silenced and not expressed. If not methylated - the gene would be expressed. Canser usually implies silencing of tumour supressor genes, and actually this is observed - cancer cells have methylated CpG islands at those tumour supressor genes. So if there is some aberration in epigenetic/genetic machinery which causes vast methylation of CpG islands it can eventually lead to silencing those tumour supressor genes and cause cancer.<br />On the other hand in intergenic regions and repetitive elements you would normally expect methylation because those are expected not need to be expressed (as for repeats) or need not be attached with epigenetic machinery (as with intergenic regions). In cancer cells the situation is the opposite - those regions tend to be unmethylated. Unmethylation of such regions of DNA leads to abnormal expression of wrong genome places and abnormal repeats expression. This leads to genomic instability and can lead to oncogenes activation. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">On the paternal allele imprint control region is methylated and particular epigenetic machinery involved in this imprinting process lead to expression of Igf2 and supression of H19. On maternal allele normally it is the opposite - imprint control region is unmethylated, so H19 is expressed and Igf2 is not. In Wilm's tumour hypermethylation occurs so that on both allele imprint control regions are methylated thus leading to supressing of H19 on both maternal and paternal alleles and expression of double dose Igf2. This contributes to cancer because Igf2 is growth promoting and thus can lead to cancer growth. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to DNMT inhibitors and is actually a form of azacitidine. It is a DNA-demethylating agent. It targets enzymatic epigenetic regulator DNMT and irreversibly binds it after it is incorporated into DNA. DNMT is needed to land methylation marks when cells divide so this binding-inhibiting can only occur while replicating. And in the case of cancer that is what we need - cancerous cells divides more rapid than other cells, so this drug prevents growth of cancer cells thus causing anti-tumour effect.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is actually a heritable trait and it's heritability is due to epigenetic mechanisms. It is "heritable" in a sense that it is transfered by epigenetic machinery when cells divide. Cancer cells divide more rapidly than other cells so epigenetic mechanisms and affecting these mechanisms plays a big role in treatment. Epigenetic drugs that alter methylation lead to new cells be different from their parent-cell. In a grown-up person cells divide rarely, so affecting DNA methylation causes low impact on their normal cells, but it affects tumour cells that divide more rapidly and thus the net effect is progress in the treatment. But when a child is developing and growing his cells do divide rather frequent and thus affecting DNA methylation can cause more severe effects on children. Those developmental periods are also called sensetive periods. So when treating children we should consider this and it is mostly inadvisable to perform such a treatment on them because it can lead to severe growth disorders, etc. </div>
