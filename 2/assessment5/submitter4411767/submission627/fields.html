    <h1>Submission 627 from Anon (session_user_id: 55c272726dcff0526d004373e37b28976bdf3358)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. This means that Decitabine will demethylate the genes for a tumor suppressor, thereby, activating tumor suppression for patients suffering from myelodysplastis syndromes.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are normally unmethylated, but are often methylated in cancer, thereby suppressing that part of the gene. The intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated and are therefore they are normally silenced. In cancer, however, these regions are unmethylated and therefore are expressed, when they shouldn't be.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the H19/Igf2 cluster, H19 is normally paternally methylated, but maternally unmethylated. On the paternal side, this means that H19 is silenced and Igf2 is activated. Whereas, on the maternal side, H19 is active and CTCFF binds to Igf2, so Igf2 is silenced. In Wilm's tumor, Igf2 is over-expressed, because it is active on both the paternal and maternal side. This creates overgrowth, as Igf2 promotes growth. Disruption in this imprinting causes Igf2 to be active both paternally and maternally, which means there are two active copies and excessive growth.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation would affect the tumor cells after treatment because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, so it is maintained in the daughter cells. A sensitive period is a period during development when cells are most sensitive to changes. The most sensitive periods are between primordial germ cells and the gamete stage and then again in the stage between gamete and epiblast. It would be inadvisable to treat during these times, because the cells would have a higher chance of developing lasting negative effects from these treatments. During the sensitive periods the long term effects of the treatment need to be considered much more.<br /></div>
