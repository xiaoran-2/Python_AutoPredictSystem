    <div class="field-value">The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to silence the gene expression. This is done by the transferring of methyl groups onto the DNA, which then compacts the chromatin and prevents activators attaching to the gene - thereby silencing it.<br />DNA methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer because the CpG islands become hypermethylated, thereby silencing tumour suppressor genes. The specific site of the CpG island that is hypermethylated is specific to a tumour type.<br />The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to silence these areas that have the potential to cause loss of genomic stability and integrity. This silencing of the repetitive elements lowers the risk of transposition, illegal recombination and mutations, where the silencing of the intergenic regions prevents cryptic transcription start and splice sites.  <br />DNA methylation in these two regions is disrupted in cancer because it becomes hypomethylated. It loses methyl groups, thereby turning off the silencing and leaving these regions and elements available for transpositions, illegal recombinations, spliced transcription and mutation.<br /><br />This disruption leads to genomic instability, stress to the cell and the resulting opportunity for mutation.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the paternal allele, methylation occurs at the Imprinted Control Region, which spreads to the H19 promoter, which is then silenced allowing the enhancers downstream to access the lgf2 gene and thereby activate it's expression.  <br />Whereas, in the maternal allele, there is no methylation of the H19 promoter because CTCF protein insulates lgf2 from the downstream enhancers, which in turn does not activate lgf2 but does activate H19's expression.<br />In Wilm's tumour, both of the parent allele's have an ICR and the associated methylated H19 promoter. This results in lgf2 being expressed in both allele's causing double the growth promotion from the overexpression of lgf2.    </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the Demethyltransferase inhibitor class, which by blocking the transfer of methyl groups onto the DNA, prevents methylation, and because there is no methylation, the genes are not silenced but expressed. In this case it is the tumour suppressor genes that are expressed, thereby having an anti-tumour effect.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the genome, because these changes in methylation can turn on or off genes that are critical to life, or the quality of life.  There are large regions of the genome, intergenic regions and repetitive elements that must remain methylated to prevent mutations etc. and associated diseases - genomic instability and lack of integrity.  <br />A sensitive period is that time in the cycle of growth from sperm/egg to birth, where there is the resetting and laying down of epigenetic marks.<br />If these alterations occur during the two most sensitive periods of reprogramming, those of early development and primordial germ cell development, there are consequences for the embryo's health and also that of subsequent generations.  <br />So if we "treat" patients during these sensitive periods, it is likely that we can make permanent changes to their genome, due to failure to reset epigenetic marks, or lay back down the required marks.  If this treatment occurs during the primordial germ cell development, we can effect not only the gestating generation, but the next as well, as these changes have occurred to the germ cells as well.</div>
