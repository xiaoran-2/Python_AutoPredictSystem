    <div class="field-value">The DNA methylation is common in zones with CpG, but not in the CpG islands, we don't use to find this silencing mark at the CpG islands, so its hypomethylated. <b></b>But in some ocasions, we can find this CpG Islands with many methyl groups, so hypermethylated, and this is common in cancer. So when we have this CpG Islands hypermaethylated, we know that DNA methylation is an epigenetic silencing mark, so it makes more difficult to access to some genes, including that ones that can supress tumors, so we find that this CpG Island hypermethylation contributes to silencing tumor supressor genes. <br />But we just don't have this DNA methylation alteration, we have an alteration also in the intergenic regions and repetitive elements. In a normal cell, we use to find it hipermethylated, and this is because to mantain genomic instability. we need to have this CpG of the intergenir regions and repetitive elements to avoid deletions, reciprocal translocations and insertions on the genes. If we have this specific regions hypermethylated, then we would find these gened aberration, and even we could lead to oncogenes activation, and this is what occurs in cancer. This wrong recombination of the genes could disrupt the coding region of a gene, and alsoactivate neughboring genes, and the activation of the oncogenes involve the growth promotion of the cells, giving them immortality and allowing to continue dividing. <br />So, if we would have this DNA hypomethilation in intergenit regions and repetitive elements, we would find a convination between the activation of the oncogenes and genomic instability, and this is used to be found in cancer. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Meanwhile we find methylation on the H19/Igf12 on the paternal allele,on  the maternal allele it's unmethylated. On a normal cell, when it's unmethylated CTCF binds an insulator element, and so the enhancers will act on H19, so Igf2 will be silenced, but if it's methylated the enhancers act on the Igf12 and will be expressed. So, if we would have both alleles, maternal and paternal, methylated, then it would be an overexpression of the Igf2, wich means that you ahve double dose on Igf2, Igf2 is both growth promoting, and we find this in Wilm's tumor. <br />Alterations in DNA methylation at ICR can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes, so overexpression of growth promoting genes. Loss of imprinting occurs in many kind of tumors, and it occurs very early, often in preneoplasic tissues, so maybe this hyper and hypomethilations in that ICR might be early events in tumor regenesis. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a drug used to treat cancers as an epigenetic inhibitor, concretly is a DNA demethylase agent. So Decitabine conytibutes on demethylating the DNA, afecting the enzyme EZH2 wich is hypermethylated, so it remove the methylation of this enzyme, and then it would deactive it. So removing methylation, then is possible to reactive tumor supressor genes, and they could end up with cancer cells. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation alterations can have enduring effects on the epigenome, due to depending on the alterations, they could contribute in cancer, and so we could see altered a lot of epigenetic mechanisms, and this situation could be so long, even it could remit. This changes on the epigenome, this alterations on the DNA methylation could occur in a sensitive period, which is just this period when we have the DNA recombination, in this moment all the silencing epigenetic marks are off, so the environment could have sereval influence in this sensitive periods. <br />We find two sensitive periods in the development, the first one is on the gametes, when the our parents would be in a embryonic stage and they are developing their sexual cells, and the second one is on the very early development, at the beggining of being embryos. <br />So, just for this reason, for this sensitive periods, someone with cancer would be enable to recive treatment during that time. So, if we treat a pregnant women, all the drugs for the treatment that we would give to her, they would go to her son, and to her grandsons to, causing effects on their epigenomes. <br /></div>
