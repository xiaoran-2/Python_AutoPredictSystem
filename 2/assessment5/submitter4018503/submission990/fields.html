    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are
usually hypomethylated in normal healthy cells. However, in cancer cells
promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which causes silencing of
the underlying gene, for example tumour suppressor genes (TSGs) which regulate
cell division and growth thereby resulting in uncontrolled cell proliferation. This
DNA methylation is recognised as one of the potential hits in the Knudson
hypothesis. Hypermethylation of CpG islands is found frequently in tumours and
is also mitotically heritable. Unusually high frequency of DNA methylation at
CpG rich sites is termed CIMP (CpG island methylator phenotype) and was first
identified in colorectal cancer. However, CIMP can now be found in other
tumours including specifically <i>MGMT</i>
in gliomas and colorectal tumours, <i>RB</i>
in retinoblastoma, <i>MLH1</i> in colorectal
cancer and <i>BRCA1</i> in breast cancer, which
in certain cases allows for a sub-classification of tumours, determines
metastatic potential and whether a patient will respond to certain
chemotherapeutic agents. CpG islands become more densely methylated as the tumour
progresses and levels are highest in metastatic tumours. Overall, hypermethylation
of TSGs enhances tumourgenesis. </p>

<p>Intergenic
regions and repetitive elements are usually hypermethylated in normal healthy
cells. However, in cancer cells both the intergenic regions and repetitive
elements are usually hypomethylated. This can lead to genomic instability, such
as the illegitimate recombination between repeats (deletions, insertions,
reciprocal translocations) as chromatin is no longer densely packed into
heterochromatin, activation of repeats and transposition, and activation of
cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes. Hypomethylation has
been shown to lead to genomic instability in both mouse models and in human
diseases. Deletion of <i>Dnmt1 </i>in
specific tissues in mice has been shown to increase genomic instability. In
humans mutation of <i>DNMT3B</i> results in
immunodeficiency, centromeric region instability, facial anomalies syndrome
(ICF). Overall, hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements enhances
tumourigenesis. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprint control region
(ICR) is unmethylated on the maternal allele and methylated on the paternal allele,
which means it is paternally imprinted as DNA methylated imprinting is on the paternal
chromosome. On the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated and therefore bound
by a protein called CTCF, which is an insulator protein. This insulator protein
insulates Igf2 from the downstream enhancers and therefore Igf2 is silenced. When
CTCF blocks the binding of these enhancers to Igf2, the enhancers loop to H19 resulting
in H19 expression. On the paternal allele this ICR is methylated therefore CTCF
can no longer bind, which leaves these enhancers free to act on Igf2 and
promote Igf2 expression from the paternal allele. H19 is no longer active on
the paternal allele due to DNA methylation spreading from the ICR to the H19
promoter silencing expression of H19. In Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS), where
there is loss of imprinting, the maternal allele behaves like the paternal
allele. This results in overexpression or double the dose of Igf2, which is an oncogene
and therefore promotes growth without any inhibition. These individuals have a
predisposition to embryonic/childhood tumours, in particular Wilm’s tumours
which is a tumour of the kidney.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the
class of epigenetic inhibitors referred to as DNA-demethylating or
hypomethylating agents. DNA methylation is an important regulator of gene
expression and appears to play a key role in the pathogenesis of hematologic
malignancies. Methylation of DNA in the proximity of a gene promoter results in
stable transcriptional silencing of its expression. Hypermethylation has been
associated with tumour progression and arrest of differentiation, through the
silencing of certain genes, including tumour suppressor genes (TSGs) which
regulate cell division and growth. When these TSGs are silenced, cell division
becomes unregulated. Decitabine is a cytosine nucleoside analog that, once
incorporated into DNA, inhibits further DNA methylation by inhibiting
methyltransferase (enzymes which catalyse the transfer of a methyl group to
DNA), resulting in hypomethylation. This leads to the reactivation and
expression of genes previously silenced including TSGs which are critical for
the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically
heritable. Based on this any alterations in DNA methylation would be passed on during
cell division to subsequent daughter and granddaughter cells until these marks
are actively erased, therefore drugs that alter DNA methylation would have
effects beyond periods of drug treatment. Epigenetic control is important
throughout development. However, sensitive periods are during development where
epigenetic reprogramming is occurring. Most sensitive periods are during primordial
germ cell development and early embryonic pre-implantation development. During
these periods particular epigenetic marks are laid down as these highly
specialised structures require specific epigenetic marks. An example of this is
generation of the sperm and egg, where particular epigenetic marks are very
important as these highly specialised structures require unique epigenetic
marks to carry out their particular functions. During these two sensitive
periods of development it would be advisable not to treat patients with these
drugs, as these drugs are systemic so every cell has the potential to be
affected. If given to patients who are pregnant this could lead to early
embryonic lethality (miscarriage) and if given to younger patients who have
developing germ cells this could lead to inappropriate control of the egg and
sperm resulting in infertility.</p></div>
