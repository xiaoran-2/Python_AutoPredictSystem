    <div class="field-value">I encountered some problems with plagiarism as outlined below and reported you for them. Up to the end of question 1, I was going to let you off with a warning, but question 2 threw you over the edge. I gave you zeros in any pieces where you did not use your own words.
Q1. According to my plagiarism checker, 77% of your content is unique, meaning you copied about 23% word for word. I'd say it's probably a bit higher than that. If I can find your sources easily (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10688866, http://www.evolutionnews.org/2013/07/more_clues_that_1074451.html), you've copied too much. Also, the language that you have used is so scientific, it leads me to believe you haven't actually understood the material and instead just copied stuff from the lectures or other sources. The purpose of using your own words is precisely to show that you have understood the material. I gave you a zero for the first part because, even though the answer is in there, the sentences that it's in are copied word for word. In the second point, I gave you a zero because, even though you correctly stated that there is hypermethylation of CpG islands, you incorrectly suggest that this may be due to "chemical such as bisulfite (in laboratory practices) might insult CpG islands and have it methylated or there is disruption during sensitive period(s). " Again, I feel like you have not understood the material, and just pasted this from what you heard in the lectures, whether it made sense in this context or not. You made zero mention of genetic stability, so I didn't give you any points for those parts of the question. Yet again, you're not showing me you have understood the concepts. In part 5, you answered the question in your words, I think, and I gave you full credit even though you did miss a piece of the question - mainly that there's genome-wide hypomethylation.  "Due to the changes in CpG island, intergenic region, and repetitive elements, causing extremely replicated cells (higher expression of oncogenes) while the tumor suppressor is "shut down" (lower expression of tumor suppressor). In this case, cancer (or cell malignancy) is inevitable." I'm not completely sure what you're saying here, but it doesn't sound right. It sounds like you're saying that by shutting down the one tumor-supressor gene, cancer is inevitable. First of all, there is more than one tumor-suppressor gene, and second, most of the time we don't know when cancer is inevitable - certainly not when generally speaking about cancer - with some specific cancers, we might, but I don't know this for a fact. Up to this point I had not made a decision to flag your assignment for plagiarism.
On to Q2. You started off well. You could've explained the first part a bit better, but the concepts were there. Most importantly, you used your own words and showed me you generally understood what you were talking about. Then you copied. My plagiarism checker shows 44% of the material plagiarized. It's actually a bit more than that - a whole paragraph almost literally copied word for word. Yes, you cited the source, but you didn't use quotation marks, and even if you had, I would've called you on it because you should not be answering most of the question with a piece of text copied and pasted from another source. Again, it doesn't show you understood the material. So I'm giving you zero points for the rest of this question. I think the answer is there, but why should I make an effort to understand the complex scientific writing that someone else used when you didn't make the effort to answer the question yourself? 
Q3 - Wow! Apparently here you didn't copy. Good for you! And just like that, I gave you full credit. See how easy that was? I didn't read anything about the bone marrow thing, and I would've liked you to have focused more on the demethylation of the tumor suppressor genes, but the answers were generally there, so I was happy to give you the points.
Q4. Part I, I can see you were having some problems with the language, but the answer is there - it's mitotically heritable. 2 points for you! The next three parts, same thing. Although I have been generous here, because there is a part of your answer that I'm not sure is correct. Mainly "Medication works in specific are of epigenetic which might causing specific changes." My guess is that this is wrong. If it worked only on specific regions, it would not be a problem to use it during sensitive periods, don't you think? Along the same lines, I think this sentence is also at least partially wrong, "to preserve the epigenetic modification, the time and type of medication should be matched." Unless you are talking about using medications that DO NOT alter epigenetics in any way, and I'm not understanding what you're saying. Then again, I decided to be generous and give you the points anyway, because you really made an effort to show me you understood what was going on.
Overall, you would've done fine if you haven't copied anything.</div>
