    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>DNA methylation 
within the context of the CpG dinucleotide, has profound
                     <b>effects on the mammalian genome</b>. DNA methylation would<b> impact the transcriptional repression</b> via inhibition of transcription 
factor binding
                     or the recruitment of methyl-binding proteins and 
their associated chromatin remodeling factors, <b>X chromosome 
inactivation</b>. <br /></li><li>It is still not clearly understand why certain CpG islands are hypermethylated in 
cancer cells while others remain
                     methylation-free. However, chemical such as bisulfite (in laboratory practices) might insult CpG islands and have it methylated or there is disruption during sensitive period(s). <br /></li><li>Normal cells, CpG island is hypomethylated, while in intergenic region and repetitive element are methylated. <br /></li><li>Cancer cells have (most likely) <strong>methylated CpG</strong> island but <strong>hypomethylated</strong> in <strong>intergenic region, repetitive element</strong> and even in <strong>exon(s)</strong>. <br /></li><li>Even at first <strong>intergenic regions</strong> are recognized as junk DNA "long non coding DNA". They <b>are now known to perform myriad functions through diverse mechanisms</b> ranging from the <b>regulation of epigenetic modifications</b> and gene expression to acting as <b>scaffolds</b> for <b>protein signaling</b> complexes. <strong>Repetitive DNA</strong> sequence elements are also fundamental to the <strong>cooperative molecular interactions forming nucleoprotein complexes</strong>. <br /></li><li>Due to the <strong>changes in CpG island, intergenic region, and repetitive elements</strong>, <strong>causing extremely replicated cells</strong> (higher expression of oncogenes) while the tumor suppressor is "shut down" (lower expression of tumor suppressor). In this case, cancer (or cell malignancy) is inevitable. However, the <strong>cancers are (epi)gene specific</strong>, the different region would give different expression of cancer.</li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"> I will describe first, the differences of paternal and maternal allele in H19/Igf2:<br /><ul><li>Maternal : unmethylated imprinted region (bound by CTCF protein) --&gt; causing of H19 promoter expression but not in Igf2 (activated by the enhancers)<br /></li><li>Paternal : methylated imprinted region (no CTCF), methylated H19 promoter --&gt; causing expression of Igf2</li></ul>In most Wilm's Tumour (WT) (18/25), H19 RNA was reduced at least 20-fold from fetal 
kidney levels. Of the expression-negative tumours ten retained 11p15.5 
heterozygosity: in nine of these, H19 DNA was biallelically 
hypermethylated and in two cases hypermethylation locally restricted to 
H19 sequences was also present in the non-neoplastic kidney parenchyma. 
Igf2 mRNA was expressed in most but not all WTs and expression patterns 
were consistent with Igf2/H19 enhancer competition without obligate 
inverse coupling. These condition implicate genetic and epigenetic 
inactivation of H19 in Wilms' tumorigenesis. <em>Nat Get.</em> 7(3):440-7 (1994)<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is in a class of medications called hypomethylation agents. 
As hypomethylation agents, it works by switching off a protein called <a>DNA</a> methyltransferase. This switches on genes (tumour suppressors, higher expression) that stop the cancer cells growing and dividing. Decitabine wokrs by helping the bone marrow produce normal blood cells and by 
killing abnormal cells in the bone marrow.<br /><br />Unfortunately, we can not compare the same/similar mechanism by the article (suggested) above (GSK2816126, JQ1, histone-deacetylase inhibitor, and azacitidine) due to different mechanisms.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>The uniqueness of epigenetic changes is even if epigenetic is "possibly changed" but it's mitotically heritable too. "Epigenetic" would be inherited to daughter cells (and for the next generations as long there's no disruption). By this finding the medication of tumour/cancer by epigenetic changing would produce mitotically identical epigenetic sets to the daughter cells.</li><li>However, there is limitation to do these epigenetic changes (medication context). The period of medication should be accurate and on the right time. Medication works in specific are of epigenetic which might causing specific changes. While the time of medication should not be done in sensitive periods.</li><li>The sensitive periods happened in pre-implantation (early development of cell) and primodial germ cell period. In these period the methylation/demethylation processes occurred in high level(s). Because some certain medication might be working as hypomethylation agents, acetylation agents, etc. The interference by medication due to these period would affect epigenetic re-programming which might causing "unexpected output".</li><li>So, to preserve the epigenetic modification, the time and type of medication should be matched.<br /></li></ul></div>
