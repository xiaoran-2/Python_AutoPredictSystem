    <h1>Submission 305 from Anon (session_user_id: 8a1f4b7b1727b3418d8804fd5bf73e3d3f6f202c)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent. It is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, which are precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. It is a cytidine analogue that works by binding DNA methytransferases, thereby decreasing DNA methylation. Since many cancers are a product of h<span>ypermethylation of CpG islands in promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes, which decreases the activity of tumor supressor genes, returning the methylation to normal levels would have an anti-tumor effect, as tumor suppressor genes would become mroe active and better regulate the cell cycle.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation turns genes off, and proper methylation is needed for proper gene expression. In a healthy genomre, CPG islands are not very methylated, and are thust transcriptionally active, while intergenic regions are methylated and silenced. In cases of CPG hypermethylation, if it occurs in a promoter region, it can lead to inactivation of certain tumor-suppressor genes, which in turn leads to uncontrolled cell division and mutation, resulting in tumor growth. At intergenic regions and repeats, the purpose of DNA methylathion is to ensure that there is less unnecessary or harmful transcription. When global hypomethylation occurs, it can lead to overall genomic instability, with activation of repeats, recombinations between repeats, and activation of cryptic promoters. This can lead to an inrease in mutations that can contribute to cancer. <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the H19/Igf2 cluster, the paternal imprint control region is methylated and Igf2 is expressed from the paternal allele, whereas the maternal imprint control region is unmethylated and active, allowing CTCF to bing and for H19 to be expressed while Igf2 is not expressed. In Wilm's tumor, there is a loss of imprinting and the maternal allele becomes hypermethylated, producing an over-expression of Igf2.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and thus changes that are induced by epigenetic drugs can have a lasting effect. Because of this, treatment during certain sensitive periods should be avoided. Sensitive periods are times of epigenetic reprogramming. Clearance and reprogramming of epigenetics marks occurs during the blastocyst stage and germ cell development. If DNA methylation during these two stages is disturbed, it can result in various diseases.</div>
