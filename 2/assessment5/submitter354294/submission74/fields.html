    <h1>Submission 74 from Anon (session_user_id: 50d4a8d575306af240c9aad9041e9eb593e7bf38)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is  a DNA-demethylating agent.  It decreases DNA methylation  by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase.  It has an anti-tumor effect because increased methylation silences tumor-suppressing genes which leads to tumors.  Decitabine lessens this unwanted methylation, and then tumor suppressor can act as usual and prevent tumors.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic marks are passed through generations until they are erased, but they cannot return once they are erased.  Since epigentic drugs remove excess methylation (extra marks), these marks will not be restored in subsequent generations.  Thus altering DNY methylation with epigenetic drugs can have endiuring effects on the epigenome even after the treatment is finished.<br /><br />A sensitive period is a period of epigenetic reprogramming: the clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks.<br /><br />Sensitive periods in humans would be very early pregnancy when epigenetic marks are cleared and reestablished in the developing fetus and the early teen period when germ cells undergo the same process.<br /><br />Treating patients during these periods will disrupt normal methylation which will then be inherited by their offsprings.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cells DNA methylation at CpG islands regulates gene expression.  When an island is not methylated, the gene it controls expresses freely.  In cancer CpG islands are more likely to be methylated.  This leads to inactivation of tumor-supressing genes and contributes to cancer.<br /><br />In normal cells In cancer  intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated.  This prevents illegitimate recombinations between repeats, activation of cryptic promoters, and activation of repeats and transposition.  In cancer intergenic regions and repetitive elements are more likely to be hypomethylated.  This disruption will lead to activation of genes that are normally silenced, like growth genes, and that will lead to uncontrollable growth, which is essentially cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">On the paternal allele the imprint control region is methylated and CTCF can not bind. There is no insulator action and enhancers are free to act on Igf2 and promote Igf2's expression from the <br />paternal allele.  Methylation also spreads downtream into the H19 promoter and thus blocks H19 expression.<br /><br />On the maternal allele the ICR is not methylated and CTCF binds.  It prevents the enhancers from acting on  Igf2 and it's not expressed.  Because the ICR is not methylated, methylation does not spread from there to H19 promoter, it's free to act, and H19 is expressed.<br /><br />H19 is a tumor-supressor gene and Igf2 is an oncogene.  In Wilms' tumor the ICR is methylated on both maternal and paternal alleles.<br /><br />This results in H19 not being expressed and not acting as a tumor supressor, whereas there is a double dosage of Igf2 expressed.  This leads to tumor development.<br /></div>
