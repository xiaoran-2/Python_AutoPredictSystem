    <div class="field-value">Normally CpG islands tend to be protected from DNA methylation. Although, sometimes they need to be methylated mostly for reasons of controlling the gene expression or for dosage compensation just like in the X inactivation. In cancer, we tend to found either hypermethlation in tumor suppresor genes and so they become silent, or hypomethylation in oncogenes which now become active. This means that not only growing factors will start to be overexpressed, there will also not be present suppresor proteins to stop them. (Usually both need to happen in order for the cancer to grow.)<br />In the intergenic regions, DNA methylation contributes to genomic stability and integrity. In repetitive elements, DNA methylation helps to prevent illegitimate recombination and transcriptional inteference. In cancer, demethylation of intergenic regions can either occur by failure of expressing DNMT1, which is the "key" enzyme in mitotic heritability of DNA methylation marks (passive demethylation), or by contribution of TET proteins which in this case are expressed when not needed (active demethylation). When that happens, then genome is much more likely to show deletions, insertions or reciprocal translocations. In addition, repetitive elements which are found throught the whole genome and in some cases are complementary, so when unmethylated, illegimate recombinations tend to happen. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The H19/Igf2 cluster consists of an imprint control region which is paternally imprinted and the Igf2 gene some bases upstream. After the ICR, there is a long non-coding RNA called H19 and is normally being produced just from the maternal allele. Whwn ICR is unmethylated just like at the maternal allele, an insulator protein called CTCF binds to it, and as a result Igf2 is insulated from the downstream enchancers and therefore is not expressed, and now H19 is prefered by this enchancers and it is now being expressed. In the paternal allele, ICR is methylated and so CTCF can not bind to it. This means that there is no insulator action and the enchancer can normally bind in their first choice, Igf2.<br />In Wilm's tumor impiriting can be disrupted by genetic abnormalities like a mutation or a deletion, by uniparental disomy or by epigenetic disruption for loss of imprinting. The three above, each one with it's own way, basically lead to the same thing. Overexpression of the paternal allele and no expression of the maternal allele. So the Igf2 growth promoting factor is overexpressed and with combination of loss of expression of Kcnq1 (tumor suppresor), leads to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a nucleoside analog DNA methyltransfer inhibitor. That means that it acts against enzymes (like DNMT1) which lay down DNA methylation. And it does so, by binding in the specific locus by the same the DNMT1. But, DNMT1 is bound irreversibly at this nucleotide and so it no longer can act. In order for all of that to happen, the cell must be replicating. And it is this over-replication process which distinguish cancer cells from normal cells, making them more susceptible to the specific DNMT inhibitor. So, when DNA methylation is inhibited, the specific marks that led the cell to be a cancer cell are erased, and once they're erased the can't be reinstablished. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">It is well known that DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. So when somethong happens by mistake, and aberrant DNA methylation starts to happen, all of the following daughter cells will be affected. Although, when this aberrant DNA methylation is inhibited by a specific drug, it will permanently be erased and not reinstablished in the daughter cells, meaning that the drug will have an effect and after the period of treatment. <br />There ase some specific periods in the lifetime, where epigenetic reprogramming is being established. These are called sensitive periods beacause of the fact that if something changes or goes wrong this specific time, will have an impact for the whole life of the patient. These sensitive periods are during the primordial germ cell development and the early development of the embryo (or the pre-implantation early development). So, a big change would be using drugs that inhibit DNA methylation and "block" the epigenetic machinery. We do know that, for now at least, these drugs aren't target-specific and so the concequences of using them during sensitive periods would be catastrophic. </div>
