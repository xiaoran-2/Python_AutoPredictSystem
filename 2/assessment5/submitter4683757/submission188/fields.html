    <div class="field-value">A normal, healthy cell can control its gene expression and genomic stability. DNA methylation is one of the tools it uses to do this job, and it is a very powerful tool indeed. At the CpG islands, which are mainly located in the gene promoters, the methylation silences the gene, which means it will not be expressed and there will be no protein product of the gene in the cell. The methylation can also silence the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements, which are not needed for the cell life, and when active can disrupt the whole genome.<br /><br />In a cancer cell, generally speaking, everything goes wrong. <br />The genes (so called tumour-suppressor genes) that are needed for normal cell development (limited growth, limited number of cell divisions) are silenced at the CpG islands in their promoters. The cancer cell grows too big, divides itself too often, or too quick, and builds a tumour. <br />To the contrary, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are not silenced, and are actively disrupting the genome, for example by leading to abnormal chromosomal architecture (deletions, insertions, translocations between chromosomes). The cancer cell is apt to divide in an uncontrolled way, and is getting more and more unstable, building finally a tumour.<br /><br />Summing up, in cancer, DNA methylation is affected in two ways: the CpG islands are hypermethylated, which results in silencing the tumour suppressor genes AND promoting the tumour development; on the other hand, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated, which results in genomic instability AND tumour development. Two ways, and the same final outcome.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The ICR of the H19/Igf2 cluster is paternally imprinted, which means it is methylated at the paternal allele, and unmethylated at the maternal allele. The methylation of the ICR prevents binding the CTCF protein to the ICR. When CTCF is not bound, the enhancer sequences located downstream of the region act directly on the Igf2 gene, stimulating its expression.<br />Summing up, due to the methylation at the ICR Igf2 is expressed only from the paternal allele.<br /><br />In the Wilm's tumour the ICR is methylated on both alleles (maternal and paternal) which results in doubled expression of the Igf2. Igf2 promotes cell growth, consequently, its overexpression leads to cell overgrowth. This in turn may end up with a tumour.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is one of the DNA methyltransferases inhibitors. As such, it will decrease the level of DNA methylation, by preventing the normal work done by methyltransferases.<br />In cancer, the tumour-suppressor genes are not active because of the methylation of their promoters (see Q1). By decreasing the DNA methylation level Decitabine may re-activate the tumour-suppressor genes and inhibit the tumour growth.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation pattern is mitotically heritable, which means it is preserved during normal cell divisions. Consequently, the effects of drugs that alter DNA methylation are also heritable, and affect the daughter cells which appear even long after the period of treatment.<br />A sensitive period, in the context of epigenome, is a period when epigenetic marks are massively changed, or deleted and re-established. There are two main sensitive periods in the development of an organism: one just after fertilization, when the epigenetic marks characteristic for the gametes are deleted to build a zygote, and the second one, when the embryo developes its own gametes which need specific marks. However, it is crucial to note that in each tissue there may be specific sensitive periods when the tissue undergoes, for example, quick development or reorganisation.<br />Using said drug treatment during a sensitive period may disrupt the DNA methylation pattern in a massive, uncontrolled way, which would be bound to cause serious side-effects. What is more, these effects of drug treatment would be inherited by the daughter cells, as I have already mentioned. As a result, the side-effects would be established, and the patient would need separate treatment.</div>
