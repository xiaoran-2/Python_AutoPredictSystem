    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>The
normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to silence gene
expression. In cancer, promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated and
so, the underlying gene will be silenced. As these silenced genes are tumor
suppressor genes, hypermethylation at CpG islands contributes to loss of tumor
suppression. The normal function of DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to provide genomic
stability. In cancer, there is hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive
elements leading to genomic instability which enhances tumorigenesis.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>In the paternal allele of the H19/Igf2
cluster, the DNA at the imprinted control region is methylated and therefore
blocks binding of the CTCF protein. If CTCF is not binded, the H19 promotor is
silenced by DNA methylation and that makes it possible for enhancers to access
Igf2 and activate Igf2 for expression. <br />
                In the maternal allele, CTCF
binds to the imprinted control region and therefore the H19 promotor is not
silenced by methylation, but expressed. This blocks the working of enhancers to
express Igf2. <br />
                In Wilm’s tumor, the
imprinted control region of the maternal allele is methylated and therefore, the CTCF protein is not binded. This causes silencing of the H19 promotor and therefore, the working of
enhancers to express Igf2 is not blocked as it should be in the maternal
allele. This causes a double dose of Igf2 (one dose  from the paternal allele and one dose from the maternal allele). This disrupted imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster
contributes to cancer as it results in overexpression of Igf2, a growth promoting
gene. This example shows that disruption of imprinting can contribute to
cancer.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine belongs to the DNMT inhibitors.
Decitabine causes DNA demethylation. Cancer is accompanied by tumour suppressor
hypermethylation causing loss of expression of tumour suppressor genes. DNA
demethylation causes less hypermethylation of the tumour suppressor genes and
by this increases the expression of tumour suppressor genes.  </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>DNA
methylation is mitotically inheritable, so in this way, drugs those alter DNA
methylation could have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment
that alter DNA methylation. A sensitive period is a period in which epigenetic
marks are being established (epigenetic reprogramming  takes place in a sensitive period). Periods of
early development and germ cell development are sensitive periods. Treating patients
during sensitive periods would be inadvisable as it would alter the epigenetic
state of the patients and this could have unwanted effects for now and in the future/the next generation(s).  </span><span><br /></span></div>
