    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation has an important role in gene expression providing cellular differentiation. Mehyl group links DNA regions with high frequency of citosine (C) and guanine (G), called CpG island, into regulatory gene region. Methylated genes have their expression inhibited (in most the cases), silenting embryo genes during adult life organisms, for example. Therefore, most of the CpG island are not methylated in normal cell, othewise the intergenic regions and reptitive elements used to be methylated. But cancer cells present methylated CpG island but introns, intergenic and repetitive regions are hypomethylated. In general, intergenic regions contain remnants of endogenous retrovirus and should be silent with methylation.  Epigenetic abnormalities can silent tumor supress gene, inhibiting 
controled cell cycle. On the other hand, some genes that promote 
division cell can be hipomethylated and, consequently, are more expessed
 promoting uncontroled proliferation. Importantly, epimutation (that seems to be more ferquently than genetic mutations in cancer and increase with aging) can be reversible using therapeutic methods. Tumor cells used to express embryonic genes in high levels, but genes involved with cell cycle (Myc gene discribed in "Cancer epicenter's" article, for example)  are target of bizarre cells. <br />. <br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Cancer cell dysplay loss of imprinting, in other words, genes that should be monoallelic expressed are not. Normal cel has imprited pattern allele that silent gene Igf2 and maternal allele that expresses Igf2 protein. When hypermethylation affects both alleles, so there is no imprinted gene, providing Wilms tumor. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine are nucleoside analog and belongs to a class of demethylating or hypomethylating agents. This analogs are incorporated into the DNA upon replication inhibiting DNA methyltransferase, thus DNA turns hypomethylated. So cancer cells that used to proliferate faster than normal cells will be more severely affected. Decitabine are used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia, reverting hypermethylation in regulatory gene and, consequently, controling cell cyclea and improve clinical prognostic.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">While methylation are removed some regulatory genes return their normal function and tumors presents low proliferation become "more susceptible to standard chemotherapy". Hystone deacethylase inhibitor has potential to difficult DNA acess and also can slow tumor growth. During treatment in cancer with epigenetic drugs, a sensitive period (a period of reprograming epigenetic marks) must be lead in consideration, because this period were considered more sensible of environment insults.<br /></div>
