    <div class="field-value">Typically, if promoter regions of DNA are methylated, the gene is less likely to be expressed.  This, however is not the case at CpG islands (which make up 60% of promoters).  These high-density CpG regions are usually unmethylated regardless of their activity state.  It is different in cancer.  Here, these CpG islands are OVER methylated, silencing the gene.  If the CpG islands are hypermethylated in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes, those are less likely to be expressed.  This methylation can be one of the "hits" in the Knudson hypothesis (where cancer is the result of multiple hits to DNA).<br /><br />In a normal cell, the intergenic regions are methylated as well as the repetitive elements (even the introns within the genes are methylated).  In a cancer cell, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements (as well as introns) are unmethylated.  This happens to some degree in all tumor types, and it progresses over time.  It most commonly happens at repeats.  The consequence of this intergenic and repetitive element hypermethylation depends on location.  It allows for illegitimate recombination between repeats and activation of repeats and cryptic promoters, potentially disrupting neighboring genes.  This creates deletions, insertions, and reciprocal translocations in the DNA, leading to genomic instability.  This instability has been shown to lead to animal and human cancers.<br /><br />Sources:<br />Epigenomics of Cancer article<br />Hypermethylation of CpG Islands in Cancer lecture<br />Hypomethylation Genome Wide in Cancer lecture</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the paternal allele of this cluster, the imprint control region (ICR) of the H19 gene and the H19 gene itselt are methylated.  With these blocked/insulated, the enhancer of this cluster enhances the promoter of the Igf2 gene.  Unlike the paternal allele, the maternal allele has the H19 gene expressed because CTCF at the ICR blocks the enhancers from accessing the Igf2 promoter, and they instead promote H19 expression.  In a Wilm's tumor, the mother's allele is methylated as well, so it acts like the paternal allele.  Essentially, there is a double dose of Igf2 expression.  Igf2 is a growth-promoting gene.  With double the gene expression for growth promotion, tumorigenesis is more likely.<br /><br />Sources:<br />Hypermethylation of CpG Islands in Cancer lecture<br />Hypermethylation of Sets of CpG Islands in Cancer lecture<br />Hypomethylation Genome Wide in Cancer lecture<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor.  Mimicking nucleotides, it irreversibly binds DNA methyltransferase after it is incorporated into DNA during the replication of DNA so that the enzyme can no longer do its job copying methylation marks to the replicated daughter strands.<br /><br />If a tumor suppressor gene has been heavily methylated, Decitabine can restore its normal function, allowing control of cell growth.  It can prevent incorrectly methlylated genes from being replicated, letting the tumor suppressor gene do its job.<br /><br />Sources:<br />Cancer Epicentre aritcle<br />Drugs that Target the Epigenetic Machinery as Chemoreceptors lecture</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because methylation marks on DNA are mitotically heritable, meaning they are passed on to daughter cells.  Once epigenetic marks are set during sensitive periods, they are copied over when the cell divides.  A sensitive period, in terms of epigenetics, is a time in which the epigenome is reprogrammed and is so is potentially able to be influenced by factors in the environment.<br /><br />Two crucial epigenetic sensitive periods happen, at the time of primordial germ cell development and in early embryonic development.  This makes early pregnancy very important; children of both genders in early embryonic development and female babies in particular when they are making the oocytes for the next generation.<br /><br />Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because the proper epigenetic programming may not occur.  On a broad level, imprinting and perhaps X inactivation (in the case of a female child) could go haywire.  On a more general level, treatment during sensitive periods could cause random hypermethylation and hypomethylation, causing inappropriate gene expression.<br /><br />Sources:<br />Week 5 lectures</div>
