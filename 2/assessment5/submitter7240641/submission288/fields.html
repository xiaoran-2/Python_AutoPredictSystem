    <div class="field-value"><br />DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mark that involves methylation of cytosine residues typically at CpG dinucleotides. This methylation is put in place by DNA methyltransferase enzymes (DNMT3a and b) and is symmetrical, therefore it can be maintained during cell division. When DNA is replicated, the daughter strand will be methylated by DNMT1, which recognizes hemimethylated DNA. Clusters of CpG dinucleotides can be found especially in gene promoter regions, and though they tend to be protected from methylation, methylation of "CpG islands" (CpGIs) occurs and generally causes silencing of downstream genes. Silencing is an important part of cell differentiation when it happens appropriately. <br /><br />It is now known that cancer is impacted by epigenetic mechanisms in addition to genetic mechanisms. Both activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressors can occur by either mechanism.<br />Cancer is associated with genome wide hypo methylation, but regional hyper methylation at CpG Islands <i></i><b></b>and the region immediately surrounding the affected CpG Islands. <br /><br />Normally, DNA methylation of promotor regions is associated with reduced gene expression. CPGIs are relatively free of methylation and are enriched in promoter regions, CpGI  methylation can be expected to affect gene transcription, silencing affected genes. This can have an oncogenic effect if genes involved in tumor suppression or cell cycle and differentiation are silenced. Methylation can affect binding of repressor proteins as with CTCF binding at the ICR impacting Igf2/H19. H19 is silenced and downstream enhancers act to increase Igf2 expression on the paternal allele.<br /><br />Normal methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements are thought to inhibit alternative start sites and antisense transcription. If these regions are hypo methylated, then misreading may occur as alternative start sites are employed. This also can lead to expression of oncogenes. <br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic control of imprinting is crucial during embryogenesis because many imprinted genes relate to growth and cell cycle. If such genes become dysregulated, they act as oncogenes, promoting growth when and where it is not appropriate.<br /><br />In the H19/Igf2 cluster, the paternal allelle is imprinted (methylated) at the ICR. Because the ICR is methylated, the suppressor protein CTCF cannot bind to the ICR. Methylation spreads to H19, suppressing expression of H19. The downstream enhancers are able to act on Igf2, promoting expression. If this happens when it is not appropriate, cells will be exposed to excess growth factors, which can tip the scale towards cancer. In Beckwith Weiderman Syndrome, overexpression of Igf2 combined with loss of a maternal growth inhibitor causes patients to be prone to childhood, but not adult tumors, such as Wilm's tumor. Wilm's Tumor is caused by a loss of the inhibitory Cdkn1c combined with an overexpression of Igf2 due to paternal disomy.<br /><br />CTCF acts by insulating Igf2 from downstream enhancers on the maternal allele.  This leaves enhancers free to act on H19, which encodes a LNC RNA. When the system is working properly, Igf2 is expressed from a single copy of the paternal allele.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a name for azacitidine, a DNA de-methylating agent that has been used to treat is used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome. Methylation of DNA is a common epigenetic mark, and many cancers involve aberrant epigenetic signals. Methylation is often associated with gene silencing <br /><br />Decitabine acts via reduction of DNA methylation and also has a cytotoxic effect on rapidly dividing cells. Reducing methylation can restore normal expression of genes relating to cell differentiation and proliferation.<br /><br />DNA methylation patterns can be conserved in daughter cells which makes this a tantalizing area for pharmaceutical research.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation patterns are heritable. Once in place, they are maintained by the action of DNMT1 each time the DNA is replicated.<br /><br />A sensitive period is a time when methylation marks are reprogrammed, such as during early embryogenesis and gametogenesis It is important to maintain pluripotency of germ cells while allowing other tissues to differentiate<br /><br />DNA methylation patterns are fairly stable in somatic cells, but undergo reprogramming during primordial germ cell development and early embryogenesis. These are the sensitive periods during which changes in epigenetic marks could set a person up for future cancers, for example. The importance of the various epigenetic marks involved in imprinting indicate that one should avoid treating pregnant and those trying to become pregnant with these agents. Even fathers-to-be are contraindicated.<br /><br />Information found in this test is taken from:<br />Marnie Blewitt's lectures<br />Cancer's Epicenter, The Economist April 7, 2013<br /><span>Hassler MR, Egger G.
