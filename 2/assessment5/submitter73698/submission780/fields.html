    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">- DNA methylation at CpG islands inhibits access to the proceeding portion of DNA by the DNA polymerase inhibiting transcription of that DNA region and thus silencing it.<br />- In cancer, methylation of CpG islands is enhanced, DNA being hypermethylated.<br />- Hypermethylation of CpG islands can result in silencing of antioncogenic or tumor-supressor genes.<br />- Methylation of intergenic and repetitive DNA regions is essential in silencing these non-coding regions, in avoiding their transposition and enhancing the general stability and separation of the coding DNA.<br />- These portions of non-coding, repetitive and intergenic DNA are identified and methylated according to certain specific nucleotide sequences, indicative of the regions nature.<br />- Transposition or de-silencing of these regions can lead to transcription of prooncogenic genes or the silencing of antioncogenic genes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">- Decitabile is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor.<br />- Decitabine's reduced histone methylation.<br />- Histone methylation of antioncogenic or tumor-supressor genes leads to their silencing. Decitabine reverses this process, allowing these genes to be expressed.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">- The paternal Igf2 allele is typically expressed due to the methylation CpG islands at H19, allowing the transcription of downstream enhancers.<br />- The maternal Igf2 allele is usually silenced because H19 is not silenced, thus allowing CTCF to inhibit Igf2 transcription and expression. <br />- In a Wilms tumour, imprinting of this cluster is disrupted due to a mutation that leads the maternal allele to act identically to the paternal allele.<br />- This imprinting disruption is responsible for the silencing of Cdkn1c, a tumor-supressor gene upstream of the H19/Igf2 cluster, and the overexpression of Igf2, which is prooncogenic.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">- During the maintenance period (representing almost the entire life of an organism), epigenetic markers are typically never modified.<br />- A sensitive period describes a period of epigenetic reprogramming, when epigenetic markers are removed and reset.<br />- Sensitive periods include early development of the fertilized egg up until it's maturation as an epiblast and during the formation of primordial germ cells.<br />- Treating patients during this period of epigenetic reprogramming could produce aberrant epigenetic markers which could lead to the silencing of vital or essential genes or the expression of harmful segments of DNA </div>
