    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG Islands (CGIs) is universally
associated with gene silencing. This silencing is achieved in two ways: first,
because CGIs are generally found at the promoter regions of genes, methylation
can physically impede the binding of transcription factors; and second,
methylated DNA can bind to proteins called methyl-CpG-binding domains that
interact with other proteins to compact the DNA (making it still less
accessible to transcription factors). In cancer, DNA methylation is altered by
the hyper-methylation of CGIs at specific loci in combination with a
hypo-methylation seen genome-wide. Although the specific CGIs that are
hyper-methylated varies by tumor type, common alterations include those for
tumor suppressor genes (thus leading to the silencing of those genes).</p>

<p>DNA methylation at intergenic regions and
repetitive elements (repeats) is also associated with transcriptional silencing
and helps to maintain genomic integrity. For example, silencing of these
regions reduces the expression of cryptic start or splice sites, and reduces
the transposition of repetitive elements. In cancer these regions are often
hypomethylated, most commonly the repetitive elements. The erroneous expression
of repeats can lead to a variety of damage to the genome, including
illegitimate recombination of repeats and disruption of neighboring genes. Hypomethylation is
also associated with the activation of oncogenes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The paternal allele is usually methylated at the imprint
control region (ICR), which prevents the binding of insulator protein CTCF and
allows the expression of Insulin-like Growth Factor (IgF2). The unmethylated
maternal allele allows the binding of CTCF, which insulates IgF2 from
downstream enhancers, preventing the expression of IgF2 and directing the enhancers
instead to act on H19 (a long non-coding RNA). In Wilms tumor there
is a disruption of imprinting that causes methylation (paternal imprint) of both alleles. This
leads to an over-expression of IgF2, and thus to uncontrolled cellular growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a cytidine analog used for the treatment of
myelodysplastic syndromes (a type of blood cell disorder) and related leukemia.
Decitabine acts as a hypo-methylating (de-methylating) agent by inhibiting DNA
methyltransferase. A common feature among cancers is the erroneous methylation
(and thereby silencing) of tumor suppressant genes; the drug is effective
presumably because it inhibits the maintenance of this erroneous methylation
which allows the re-expression of tumor suppressant genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation state is mitotically heritable because of
DNA Methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), an enzyme that recognizes hemi-methylated DNA
and methylates the unmethylated strand. Most of these methylation marks are
established at the end of what are called “sensitive periods,” periods during
which the epigenome is susceptible to changes caused by environmental signals.
This occurs during pre-implantation development of an embryo and during germ
cell development, when the epigenome is reprogrammed: most of the DNA methylation
and the histone marks are removed to begin tissue-specific epigenetic marking.
Treating patients during these periods or (really when their future offspring are
engaged in these periods) could be harmful to potential offspring by altering epigenetic
marks that would otherwise be correct. Whereas in somatic tissue a given cancer
drug is most likely to be effective against cancer-related epigenetic marks,
during a sensitive period the drug can act to promote or inhibit marks that are
essential for the health or viability of the offspring. <br /></p></div>
