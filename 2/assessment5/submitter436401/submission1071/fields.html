    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is the basis for different epigenetic phenomena such as imprinting, X chromosome inactivation or the formation of heterochromatin<span>. <br /></span>Exceptions are CpG islands, which are found in about 60% of promoters. They have a high CpG density and are usually kept free of methylation independent of their activity state. However, in cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene.<br />The epigenome of cancer cells displays numerous alterations in comparison to the epigenome of their normal counterpart. Changes in DNA methylation include a genome-wide loss and a regional gain of DNA methylation. This causes on one hand genomic instability and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes and on the other hand silencing of tumor suppressor genes – controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair – by hypermethylation of their promoter CpG islands<span>.<br /></span>target of aberrant DNA methylation in cancer are CpG island shores, defined as approximately 2 kb regions surrounding CpG islands. These regions were initially identified hypermethylated in colorectal cancer and represent regions of tissue specific methylation in normal tissues<span>. Methylation of shore regions is related to gene expression and has also been detected in different tumor cell lines and nerve sheath tumors.<br /></span>Targeting mechanism of epigenetic modifications relies on lncRNAs, which function as “adaptor platforms” for interactions between chromatin and chromatin remodeling complexes and are able to recruit and direct chromatin remodeling complexes to specific loci in the genome. The longest-known examples for this are lncRNAs involved in epigenetic silencing and imprinting, such as the X-inactivation promoting lncRNA XIST, which recruits the Polycomb repressive complex (PRC) to silence the X chromosome from which it is transcribed<span> and TSIX, which is transcribed from the opposite strand and regulates XIST levels during X-inactivation.</span><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. A hypomethylating agent is a drug that inhibits DNA methylation.When there is an increase in DNA methylation this can result in the blockage of the activity of "suppressor genes" that regulate cell division and growth.  When suppressor genes are blocked, cell division becomes unregulated, allowing or promoting cancer. Decitabine's anticancer effects are believed to be twofold.   One way that it works is by demethylation or interfering with the methylation of DNA.  By this process of demethylation, normal function to the tumor suppressor genes is restored, thus restoring control over cell growth.<br />Cells in the presence of Decitabine incorporate it intoDNA<span> during replication and </span>RNA<span> during transcription. The incorporation of Decitabine into </span>DNA<span> or </span>RNA<span> inhibits methyltransferase thereby causing demethylation in that sequence. This adversely affects the way that cell regulatory proteins are able to bind to the </span>DNA/RNA<span>substrate.</span><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>The imprinted H19 gene, which encodes an untranslated RNA, lies at the end of a cluster of imprinted genes in the mouse. Imprinting of the insulin-2 and insulin-like growth factor 2 genes, which lie about 100 kilobases upstream of H19, can be disrupted by maternal inheritance of a targeted deletion of the H19 gene and its flanking sequence. Animals inheriting the H19 mutation from their mothers are 27% heavier than those inheriting it from their fathers. Paternal inheritance of the disruption has no effect, which presumably reflects the normally silent state of the paternal gene. The somatic overgrowth of heterozygotes for the maternal deletion is attributed to a gain of function of insulin-like growth factor 2, rather than a loss of function of H19.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
