    <div class="field-value">       DNA methylation in CpG islands has the function of silencing gene expression; for example the inactivation of X chromosome in order to have the same dosage of genes on the X chromosome in males and females. Methylated CpG can also be bound by CpG binding proteins like MeCP1 and MeCP2 which represses transcription and condenses the chromatin and can prohibit Transcription Factors binding which leads to silencing. DNA methylation has an important role in maintaining genomic stability. In a normal cell CpG islands are hypomethylated, and the intergeneic regions, introns and repetitive elements are hypermethylated. <br />       In cancer a reverse pattern is observed. DNA hypermethylation at CpG islands silences tumor suppressor genes. DNA hypomethylation of repeats and intergenic intervals can lead to illegitimate recombinations, which in normal cells can not happen as they are heavily methylated, heterochormatinised. The repeats can be activated and can transpose and disrupt the coding region of a gene or activate neighboring genes, like in the case of the Axin fused and Agouti viable yellow allele. Deletions, insertions, reciprocal translocations are the result of the hypomethylation, in other words, genetic stability is lost. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">        Igf2 expression is active on the paternal allel because the imprinting control region (ICR) is methylated and allows the enhancers to act on Igf2. On the other hand on the maternal allele the ICR it is not methylated and CTCF binds to it which means the enhancers will act on H19 and Igf2 will be silent.<br />        Disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer. An example would be the methylation of the ICR on the maternal allel which leads to a double dose of growth promoting genes, therefore associated with Wilm's tumor. Disruption of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 leads to overexpression of Igf2 which has growth-promoting<div>properties, therefore it enables and stimulate cell proliferation and tumorigenesis.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent, a DNMTi - DNA methyl transferase inhibitor which incorporates into the DNA upon replication and when DNMT1 comes along to bind the nucleotide in order to copy the methylation to the daughter strand the DNMT1 is bound irreversibly and can not be released. The action of Decitabine is division dependent so cancer cells which replicate more will be effected. It reactivates epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor genes through hypomethylation.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>DNA methylation can be manipulated and enduring effects are ensured as the DNA methyltransferase enzymes preserve methyl marks during mitosis.The treatment is not advisable in the sensitive periods because that is when epigenetic reprogramming is occurring. These sensitive periods are the pre-implantation period/early child development and primordial germ cell development in males and females.<br /></div></div>
