    <h1>Submission 973 from Anon (session_user_id: 5597d24ba9386d397c9a9edd2356335adf0e6404)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent(or DNMT inhibitor) which works by inhibiting DNMT1. By inhibition of DNMT1 this drug can decrease methylation of DNA during cancer cell replication. In cancer cells,  aberrant methylation may have occurred at a promoter region controlling transcription of a tumor suppressor gene. If methylation is decreased at this site by a DNMT1 inhibitor such as decitabine then the tumor suppressor gene may be transcribed more and act to slow growth of the tumor and possibly induce apoptosis.<br />Mechanistically, less methylation of its promoter would increase transcription of the tumor suppressor gene via decreased binding of MeCpG 1 and 2 .  MeCpG 1 and 2 act to condense chromatin thereby inhibiting transcription.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">By definition, to have an epigenetic effect  a drug has to have an effect that is mitotically heritable. Therefore the effect of the drug will persist for a prolonged period.  DNA methylating agents convert a cytosine residue to a 5 methyl cytosine. Then during mitosis when the DNA is replicated DMNT1  recognizes a hemi-methylated DNA at a CpG and then methylates the associated CpG on the  DNA daughter strand. This is repeated in further cell divisions.<br />Epigenetic "sensitive periods" occur at times when most epigenetic marks are removed and then laid down again. This occurs during early embryogenesis and  during the formation of the primordial germ cells.  Additionally, during periods of cell differentiation there can be tissue-specific sensitive periods such as the period during which the hippocampal cells in rat pups were epigenentically sensitive to the maternal care  behaviour that the rat pups were exposed to.<br />These sensitive periods, especially during early embryogenesis and  the formation of the primordial germ cells, are the times that the epigenome will be most sensitive to environmental influences. So introduction of an epigenetically active agent such as decitabine could inhibit normal denovo methylation globally on the epigenome resulting in multiple deleterious effects. <br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In cancer there is a general trend occurring across all tumor types for  CpG islands to become hyper-methylated and the intergenic regions and repetitive elements to become hypo-methylated<br />DNA methylation of CpG islands (CGIs) is rare in normal DNA but where it occurs is related to gene silencing where the CGIs are associated with gene promoters as they frequently are.  In cancer CGIs tend to become progressively hyper-methylated. In cases where the hyper-methylation occurs at promoters for tumor suppressor genes then these genes can be silenced leading to decreased production of the tumor supressor.  This in turn leads to increased growth on the part of the tumor.<br />At intergenic regions, normally DNA methylation of CpG dinucleotides results in silencing of cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites.  Thus these DNA methylations function to protect genetic stability and prevent inappropriate transcriptional interferences.<br />In cancer these sites can be hypo-methylated resulting in genetic instability.<br />In normal cells  repetitive elements are silenced by DNA methylation to: prevent transcription of proteins such as gag and pol whose expression can lead to inappropriate transpositions of genetic material,  silence transcriptional interference from strong promoters and to prevent illegitimate re-combinations by inhibiting open chromatin structure at these repetitive elements.<br />In cancer cells  repetitive elements tend to be hypo-methylated which leads to increased deletions, reciprocal transpositions and insertions because of decrease of the normal controls referred to above . This is associated with the cancer hallmark of genetic instability.<br />In tumors one can imagine that as epimutations or genetic mutations occur those changes associated with faster growth will be selected for within the various clones of cells in the tumor. This variation of "natural selection" may contribute to  carcinogenesis and increasing aggressiveness of the tumor.  <br />     <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Loss of imprinting can contribute to cancer as demonstrated in the case of Wilm's tumor.  Normally, on the paternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster the Imprint Control Region(ICR) is hyper-methylated.  This blocks the binding of CTCF to the ICR allowing downstream enhancers to enhance transcription of the upstream IGF2 gene. Whereas in the case of the normal maternal allele the ICR is not methylated and thus  allows binding of CTCF which then blocks the transcription of the IGF2 gene.<br />However, in Wilm's tumor the ICR in the maternal allele is hyper-methylated similarly to the paternal allele so in both alleles the IGF2 gene is transcribed.  This results in a double dose of the gene product of the IGF2 gene, a growth promoter.  An increased level of a growth promoter can cause or contribute to carcinogenesis.   <br /></div>
