    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><strong>CpG islands</strong><br /><ul><li>DNA methylation is laid down by DNMT3a and DNMT3b, and subsequently maintained by DNMT1. CpG islands tend to be protected from methylation (methylation at CpG island = silencing of gene expression).  </li><li>In cancer, CpG island could become hypermethylated. </li><li>This would lead to silencing of tumour suppressor genes, behaving as 2nd hit (or multiple hits) in the Knudson hypothesis in the cancer development.</li></ul><strong>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements</strong><br /><ul><li>These regions are usually hypermethylated, to prevent genomic instability. Silencing of repeats is important to prevent transposition of transposable elements, and thus preventing illegitimate recombination. </li><li>In cancer, these regions become hypomethylated. </li><li>As a consequence, this would lead to genomic instability, resulting in illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes. </li></ul><br /><br /><strong></strong></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">H19/Igf2 cluster in normal individuals<br /><ul><li>Imprint control region (ICR) separates the Igf2 and H19.<em></em></li><li>ICR is usually methylated on paternal allele, blocking the binding of CTCF, which is an insulator protein. Without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads from H19 promoter to silence this, and allow the downstream enhancers to access <strong>Igf2 to activate</strong>. </li><li>ICR is usually unmethylated on maternal allele, allowing the binding of CTCF, and insulate the Igf2 from the downstream enhancers. Hence, <strong>Igf2 is silenced</strong>. On the other hand, H19 promoter is active, </li></ul>H19/Igf2 cluster in cancer<br /><ul><li>In Wilm's tumour, hypermethylation occurs at the ICR. Both paternal (usually methylated) and maternal (usually unmethylated) allels are now methylated. </li><li>This would allow the expression of Igf2 from both the paternal (usually active) and maternal (usually inactive) alleles, leading to the overexpression of Igf2, resulting in excessive growth promotion. </li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent, also known as hypomethylating agent. It is a nucleoside analogue, irreversibly bind DNMT after it is incorporated into DNA, therefore it is replication dependent. It progressively leads to DNA hypomethylation with each cell cycle replication. However, it induces genome-wide demethylation without region specificity. <br /><br />The mechanism of anti-tumour effect is uncertain. It seems to work preferably in haematological malignancies. <br /><ul><li>Cell replication dependent, and thus preferably affecting tumour cells with fast cell turnover. </li><li>Allows re-expression of methylated tumour suppressor genes. </li><li>Example: H19/Igf2 imprinted locus is strongly demethylated by decitabine in AML cells, and might contribute to the haematopoietic self-renewal program. </li><li>Prolonged treatment at non-cytotocic 'hypomethylating' dose seems to inhibit the renewal of leukaemic cells. <br /></li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome. This is because e</span>pigenetic changes are mitotically heritable, i.e. the altered DNA methylation in tumour clone could be passed on the daughter cells, and the converse is true that the altered DNA methylation from drug therapy could be passed on, until they are actively erased by another mechanism. <br /><span><br /></span>In epigenetic, sensitive period is defined as a period where there is clearing and re-establishment of epigenetic marks, i.e. epigenetic reprogramming. <br /><br />There are two identified sensitive periods of development:<br /><ul><li>Early development during pre-implantation period.</li><li>Primordial germ cell development.</li></ul>Treating patients with epigenetic modulators during sensitive periods would be inadvisable, such as young patients (during germ cell development) as this would lead to major disruption of epigenetic reprogramming with long-lasting effect, affecting the remaining of lifespan, or possibly the next generation(s) via the gamette. Several examples were given during this course:<br /><ul><li>Assisted reproductive technologies</li><li>Cloning</li><li>Somatic cell reprogramming</li><li>Environmental influence e.g. diet, maternal care, chemical exposure</li></ul></div>
