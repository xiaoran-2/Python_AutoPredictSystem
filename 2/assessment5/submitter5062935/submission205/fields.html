    <div class="field-value"><p>In the DNA
bases, the methyl group is normally found on the thymine nucleotide of the
pyrimidine base. However, DNA methylation results in the addition of the methyl
group to the 5’ carbon atom of the cytosine in the cytosine-guanine
dinucloetide in the mammalian genomes by the help of a methyltransperase
enzyme, DNMT1. </p>

<p>In a normal
cell, the CgP islands are hypomethylated ie unmethylated whereas the other parts
of the cell like the intron, repetitive (RE) elements and intergenic regions
(IR) are methylated. Recall that methylation means silencing. Therefore, DNA
methgylation entails the silencing or the inactivatyion of the underlying
epigenetic marks. And this could be sustained because DNA methylation has been
found to be mitotically heritable.</p>

<p>Therefore a
normal cell in which the CpG islands are not hypo methylated will inactivate
the Oncogenes, while activating the Tumour suppressors. </p>

<p>In contrast,
a cancer cell has a hyper methylated CpG islands and hypo methylated Repetitive
elements, Intergenic regions, introns etc, thereby resulting in the activation
of the Oncogenes and inactivation of Tumour suppressors.</p>

<p><span>In a normal
cell where the Repetitive elements and the Intergegic regions are
hypermethylated, repeats do not happen, since the condition requires genetic
similarity as well as euchromatin. But in cancer cells, hypomethylation of the
RE and IR could result to illegitimate re combination of different chromosomes
because they are not densely packaged into heterochromatins. Furthermore,
hypomethylation can activate RE to recopy themselves and get transposed into
other genomic regions causing possible disruptions in the neighbouring genetic
coding process and transcriptional aberration, like deletions, insertions,
reciprocal translocation etc, all culminating into genomic instability.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The Igf2 is
methylated in the paternal allele, meaning that the DNA methylation imprint is
on the paternal chromosome. The methylation of the ICR in the paternal allele
prevents the binding of the insulator protein CTCF, thereby allowing the
downstream Enhancers to activate and promote Igf2s expression.DNA methylation
in the ICR in the paternal allele also spreads downstream to the H19 promoter
to silence its expression because in this case, H19 is a CpG island promoter. </p>

<p>In the
maternal allele, ICR is non methylated which is due to the action of an
insulator protein, CTCF which binds the ICR, insulating Igf2 from the
downstream Enhancers along the genome, making it possible for them to rather
activate and enhance the H19 expression.</p>

<p>Loss of
imprinting in the ICRs leads to Uniparental Disomy. An alteration in the DNA
methylation at the maternal ICR can result in overexpression of growth
promoting genes i.e. oncogenetic. This early stage disruption can result to Wilm’s
tumour. </p>

<p><span>Therefore the
disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 – the Hypermethylation of ICR in both alleles
can lead to cancer – an aberration in the genomic stability. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine as a drug is a form of DNA
methyltranferse inhibitor. Decitabine targets particular enzymic epigenetic
regulators through DNA methylation. This it does by binding irreversibly with
DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA.</p>

<p><span>At an appropriate low dose, Decitabine
could have a very good anti-neoplastic effect on aberrant genes in killing the
tumour cells, because they are capable of bringing about DNA methylation.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Recall how we had already stated in question 3 above
that altering DNA methylation with a drug like Decitabine could have a lasting
effect on decimating cancer causing tumour cells, which is achieved by binding irreversibly with DNMTs after they are incorporated
into DNA.</span></p>

<p>Sensitive periods are periods of active remodelling of
the epigenome and as such when changes in the environment will have the most
significant effects on the epigenetic make-up in the cell.</p>

<p>In humans’ development two sensitive periods could be
distinguished which are period of Germ cell development &amp; Early embryonic
development.</p>

<p>As stated earlier, sensitive periods are periods of
active removal and relaying of epigenetic marks in the genome. It has also been
established that certain drugs can affect epigenetic processes. Therefore treating
patients during sensitive period could lead to certain unwanted aberrations or
epigenetic changes chemotherapically which could be passed on eventually to the
next generation as has been proven that epigenetic modifications could be
mitotically inheritable.</p><p><br /></p><p>Reference:</p><p>Hassler MR, Egger G.
