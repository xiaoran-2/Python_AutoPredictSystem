    <div class="field-value">DNA shows altered patterns of methylation from normal, with genome-wide loss and region specific gains of methylation seen in cancers.<br /><br />CpG islands (CGI) appear protected from methylation and in a hypo-methylated state in normal cells, but in cancer cells they are hyper-methylated. CpG island shores (regions approx. 2Kb upstream and downstream from CGIs) also appear hyper-methylated in cancer. CGIs are frequently at gene promoters where methylation acts to silence tumour suppressor genes.<br /><br />In contrast, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hyper-methylated in the normal state, but hypo-methylated in cancer. This reduction in methylation results in genomic instability. Not only does hypomethylation make repeated regions more closely resemble other repeated regions, but in conjunction with reduced heterochromaticity, more open chromatin is available, allowing undesirable recombinations and other transpositions, which are inherently drawn to regions of similarity. Repeats can also be activated, resulting in repeats being copied or moved about the genome, into genes or promoters, causing dysregulation. Hypomethylation can also increase transcriptional noise from alternate start sites/cryptic promoters -- disrupting neighboring genes; derepress antisense transcription, redirect RNA splicing; and throw off replicative timing.  All of these events could contribute to progression of cancer.<br /> </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Loss of imprinting can result from either hypermethylation or hypomethylation of Imprint Control Regions (ICRs). Depending on context, this will either repress growth restricting genes or enhance growth promoting genes, producing aberrant expression in either case. With respect to the H19/Igf2 cluster, hypermethylation of the ICR on the maternal allele can lead to pathology.<br />  <br />The normal paternal allele ICR is methylated, preventing the CTCF insulator protein from binding to the ICR. DNA methylation at the ICR facilitates heterochromatin spreading to the H19 promoter, silencing it. This resulting chromatin configuration favors upstream enhancers reaching and activating the Igf2 promoter, resulting in expression of Igf2. <br /><br />The normal maternal ICR is unmethylated, allowing CTCF to bind there and insulate the Igf2 promoter from enhancers, blocking expression of Igf2. Enhancers are then free to activate the H19 promoter. <br /><br />When imprinting is lost, as seen with Wilm's tumour, the maternal ICR is hypermethylated,  and produces a methylation configuration like the paternal ICR,  doubling production of Igf2.  Igf2 is a growth promoting gene, and its overexpression through loss of imprinting can behave like an activated oncogene, resulting in uncontrolled growth and cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent (DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor). It is a nucleoside analogue which is incorporated into DNA and appear to DNMTs as cystosine, but binds irreversibly to DNMTs as they attempt to copy methylation to daughter strands in replication (so this agent is replication dependent). The result is a loss of DNA methylation. Decitabine can be deployed at the appropriate (low) doses to treat myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), a cancer where hypermethylation of CpG islands is associated with a poor prognosis for MDS patients. It is possible that for MDS, and possibly other CIMP (CpG Island Methylator Phenotype) cancers, demethylation can have an anti-tumour effect.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable -- daughter and granddaughter cells can carry results of an epigenetic treatment through cell divisions. There are "sensitive" periods where epigenetic marks are cleared and reset, critically, pre-implantation early development and gametogenesis (primordial germ cell development). Treating patients during these periods can disrupt epigenetic reprogramming stages like imprinting, resulting in aberrant development, including defects like Beckwidth-Wiedmann, Angelman, or Prader-Willi syndromes.</div>
