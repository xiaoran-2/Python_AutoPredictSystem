    <div class="field-value"><b>When DNA methylation happens in gene promoter regions, results in </b><b> inversely </b><b>correlated gene expression, usually gene silencing is the ultimate outcome. But unlike CpG islands,  DNA methylation cannot occur</b><b> in usual normal cells</b><b>. The reason is to maintain the constant regulated synthesis of the household gene encoded proteins. However in case of cancer cells, CpG islands tends to become hypermethylated, resulting gene silencing. The function of tumour suppressor genes is to restrain the tumorous condition. But when the tumour suppressor genes cannot hold back the condition, tumours progress. In DNA methylation, there is an enzyme called EZH2, which is responsible to cause DNA methylation. In cancerous condition, usually the enzyme EZH2 encoding gene is found to be mutated. As a consequence, in tumour suppressor genes EZH2 is over expressed causing hypermethylated condition of histones which in turns cannot stop to control overgrowth of cells and causes cancer. Intergenic regions do not contribute to protein encoding genes, however they are critically important ultraconserved regions found in human. In cancerous cells of adult chronic lymphocytic leukemia, colorectal and hepatocellular carcinomas and neuroblastomas, these ultraconserved regions have found to express aberrantly.</b></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><b> Chromatin and chromatin remodelling complexes are linked by </b><b>Inc RNAs, which work as an adapter molecule</b><b> and it has the ability to recruit chromatin remodelling complexes at the specific loci of the genome. Paternally expressed Inc RNA RNAs are responsible to silent maternally expressed some of the proteins, which are not necessary to maintain cell’s normal function and thus causes “blastema” in Wilm’s tumor. For example IGF2 supposed to be expressed from paternal allele and H19 shoud be expressed from maternal allele, however if these are found in both to be expressed from both parents indicating towards serious expression aberrancy. This kind of genetic expression mistake can contribute to tumours like Wilm’s tumour through blastema formation.</b></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span><strong>Decitabine is one of the hypomethylating agent of JQ1 group drugs that have proved to exert clinical effects on DNA methylation associated tumours. Decitabine inhibits an epigenetic regulator called BRD4, blocks the activity of Myc encoded protein called “transcription factor”, a part of DNA-regulation system. As a hypomethylating agent, Decitabine hypomethylates the unusually hypermethylated regions of DNA which caused diseases including tumours. Therefore, if Decitabine is applied in a tumour patient, it will try to suppress the hypermethylated regions resulting activation of tumour suppressive genes to suppress the progressing tumour eventually.</strong></span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span><strong>There might be two ways to explain this-

1.    Epigenetic changes induced in tumour cells by those drugs firstly changes the epigenomic behaviour used to cause tumour or other diseases. So after using the drugs, the clinical evidences will be reduced or completely gone. Another factor is, the epigenomic changed induced by drugs will be passed to the next generations without returning back to its original tumorous condition.

2.    When chemotherapies are applied to patients who have already been treated with epigenomic long lasting drugs, it will act better to recover from the cancerous condition. Because now the drugs have already started to activate tumour suppressing genes, which are working against tumour besides chemotherapy. 

Sensitive periods are the most crucial periods of human development. Usually upto 6 years is considered as a sensitive period of human development.During this critical period treatmetn of patients is inadvisable because the drugs or therapies used in this period can severyly damage the growth and specific organs through alternating the epigenomc approachs.</strong></span></div>
