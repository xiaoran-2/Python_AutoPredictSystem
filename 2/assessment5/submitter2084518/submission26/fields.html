    <div class="field-value">*DNA profiling of normal vs cancer cells indicates that in normal samples, DNA is hypomethylated at CpG islands of gene promoter, while in cancer samples, DNA is hypermethylated at the CpG islands.<br /><br />* Disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands (CpG island shores, CpG island methylator phenotype CIMP) is considered as mutation of the epigenome, which silence the tumor suppressor genes, leading to uncontrol of cellular proliferation, tumor growth and cancer formation. <br /><br />* DNA profiling of normal vs cancer cells indicates that in normal 
samples, DNA is hypermethylated at  the intergenic regions and 
repetitive elements, while in cancer samples, DNA is hypomethylated at the intergenic and 
repetitive regions.<br /><br />* Disruption of DNA methylation at intergenic regions, repetitive elements and CpG poor promoters causes genomic instability and oncogenic activation, contributes to cellular proliferation, tumor growth and cancer formation.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Studies showed that disruption of imprinting pattern in ICR of the H19/Igf2 cluster genes can contribute to tumor formation and leading to cancer.<br /><br />* The imprinting control region (ICR) on the paternal allele is hypermethylated,  thus is not interacted with CTCF, promote region of H19 gene. As a result, enhancer directly activates and over-expresses upstream Igf2 gene, but suppresses H19 gene expression.<br /><br />* In contrast, the ICR on the maternal allele is hypomethylated and thus interacts with methylation-sensitive CTCF, causing enhancers to activate and over-expresses H19 gene, while silence Igf2 gene<br /><br />* In Wilm's tumor, both ICRs on paternal and maternal alleles are hypermethylated and not interacted with CTCF. H19 gene therefore is not expressed. The enhancers directly activate and over-express upstream Igf2 genes on both alleles, promote growth and tumor formation.<br /><br />* Disruption of DNA methylation at ICRs can cause instability to the genome, loss of expression of tumor suppressor genes or promote over-expression of growth enhancer genes, leading to tumor progression and cancer formation.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">* Decitabine is a FDA approved cancer drug which belongs to DNA Methyl-tranferase Inhibibor (DNMTi) class of epigenetic inhibitors.<br /><br />* Decitabine is a nucleoside analog, which can incorporate into double stranded DNA and irreversibly binds to DNA methytranferase, inhibits the enzyme to transfer methyl group for de novo DNA methylation<br /><br />* Decitabine incorporates into DNA double helix causing interruptions of the DNA replication in tumor cells. This drug also irreversibly binds to DNA methyltranferase, inhibits the DNA methylation at CpG islands. Hypomethylation at CpG islands, CpG island shores, CpG island Methylator Phenotype (CIMP) normally activates tumor suppressor genes promoting anti-tumor effect and safe-guarding cellular proliferation. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">* Altering DNA methylation, including CpG island hypermethylation, genome-wide hypomethylation, LRES, LREA, LOCKs, histone modification, nuclear architecture and non coding RNAs can cause genomic instability, aberrant DNA repair function, leading to point mutations, translocations, amplification, deletions and/or copy number variants. These will have enduring effects on both the epigenome and the genome, in worse case would cause disease formation and cancer development.<br /><br />* Sensitive period is when epigenetic marks_ such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, nuclear architecture.._ are established and/or reprogrammed in the genome and epigenome.<br /><br />* Sensitive periods of development include pre-implantation period early development and primordial germ cell development.  Pre-implantation period early development involves active and rapid demethylation in the paternal genome but passive demethylation in the maternal genome, while primordial germ cell development involves differential resetting of spermatogenesis and oogenesis.<br /><br />* It would be cautious and inadvisable to treat patients during these sensitive periods because the pharmacological effect of the treated drug during the establishment of the epigenetic marks will have a long lasting impact not only on the life-time of the patients' genome, but also on the genomes of his/her offsprings of many generations afterward. </div>
