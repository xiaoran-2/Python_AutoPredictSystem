    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands (CGIs) is the silencing of gene
expression, primarily by the formation of a repressive chromatin structure but
also through the prohibition of transcription factor binding.  However active genes are not normally
methylated at CGIs.</span></p>

<p><span>In cancer DNA
methylation of CGIs occurs at genes which are not normally methylated or become
unmethylated in genes that are normally methylated.  <span>Thus methylation at CGI’s turns off tumour
suppressor genes which are normally unmethylated and therefore active and
unmethylates</span>  and so turns on oncogenes
which are normally methylated and so inactive. Methylation  can also happen in sets of genes and this is
known as CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP).</span></p>

<p><span>Normally
intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated to provide genomic
stability and prevent loss or gain of chromosomes, or illegitimate
re-combinations between chromosomes. In cancer intergenic regions and
repetitive elements become unmethylated, that is the regions lose their methylation.
This loss of DNA methylation in the intergenic regions and repetitive elements
causes loss of genomic stability allowing re-combination between repeats, the
activation of repeats, transposition, the activation of cryptic promoters and
consequent disruption to neighbouring genes, including transcriptional
aberrations. This loss of stability in one or all of its forms may lead to
cancer through either genetic mutation or the switch on of oncogenes and/or switching off of tumour suppressor genes.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinted genes
are those whose expression is determined by the parent that contributed them.
In humans the IGF2 allele inherited from the father (paternal) is expressed and
the maternal allele is not.</p>

<p>On the paternal
allele <span>methylation of the imprint control region
blocks CTCF binding, silences the <i>H19</i> promoter, and allows activation of
paternal <i>IGF2</i>
transcription by the downstream enhancers.</span>  On the maternal allele the imprint control region is
unmethylated which allows binding of CTCF and expression of H19 because of the
action of the enhancers on H19. Because the enhances act on H19 and not IGF2,
IGF2 is silenced.</p>

<p><span>In Wilm’s
tumour both paternal and maternal imprint control regions are methylated, CTCF
binding is blocked and H19 silenced and therefore both enhancers act to express
IGF2 on both alleles. As IGF2 is a growth promoter gene, expression from both alleles
that is overexpression of the growth factor causes accumulation of pre-neoplastic
tissue and ultimately neoplasia.<span class="_wysihtml5-temp-placeholder"></span></span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is
an FDA approved DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi), referred to in the
article “Cancer’s Epicentre” as a DNA-demethylating agent. It is approved for
the treatment of Myelodysplastic syndrome which progresses to Accute Myeloid
Lymphoma. It acts to inhibit DNA methylation of tumour suppressor genes thus
allowing the genes to express normally to inhibit tumourigenesis.</span></p>

<p><span>The anti-tumour
effect is achieved because Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue that
incorporates into the DNA structure and irreversibly binds the enzyme (DNMT)
and so inactivates it and does not allow it to methylate DNA. It’s effects are
therefore replicated on cell division. As mentioned above, because of this the
suppressor gene is not DNA methylated and remains active against tumourigenesis.<span class="_wysihtml5-temp-placeholder"></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation
is a stable epigenetic mark, which is passed on mitotically and so endures
in the epigenome, for example in the case of X chromosome inactivation and
imprinting. Changes in DNA methylation
which include genome-wide hypomethylation and specific regional
hypermethylation can cause genomic instability and lead to neoplasia. Mouse studies of the AVY allele indicate that DNA
methylation is unlikely to be an inherited epigenetic mark, however genetic
studies of the plant <i>Linaria vulgaris </i>suggest
phenotype variation caused by heritable DNA methylation at the <i>Lcyc</i> gene.</span></p>

<p>A sensitive
period is where epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation are being reset during
mitotic and meiotic division and during tissue remodelling. The
sensitive periods are primordial germ cell, germ cell development and early
embryonic development. There can be reprogramming differences between these
periods. For example imprinted genes undergo reprogramming in primordial germ
cells but not in early development.</p>

<p><span>Treating
patients during sensitive periods may result in the incomplete resetting of
epigenetic marks, including DNA methylation. It is also known that epigenetic
patterns are initially established as a consequence of developmental cues
(Hassler and Egger, 2012) Younger patients may therefore be
particularly susceptible to treatment during germ cell development. </span></p></div>
