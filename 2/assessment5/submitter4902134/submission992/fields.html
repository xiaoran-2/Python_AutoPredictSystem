    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><div>Normally, CpG islands at promoters are mostly hypomethylated, and few of methylated CGIs often mean gene expression silencing. While in cancer, most CGIs are hypermethylated, resulting in the silencing of tumour suppressor genes. This state of hypermethylation progresses during cancer development. DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, so that these CGIs remain hypermethylated and the silencing state is kept during cell divides. That particular cell without tumour suppressor genes expressed is readily ends up in tumour.<br /><br /></div><div>In intergenic regions and repetitive elements, DNA is usually methylated. This state of methylation helps to maintain genomic integrity. While in cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to become hypomethylated, and the methylation level decrease as the cancer worsening. The hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements bring about genomic instability, such as deletions, insertions, transposition, illegitimate recombination, reciprocal translocations and transcriptional interference from strong promoters. Some cancer is driven by chromosomal instability, and this hypomethylation state enhances tumourigenesis.</div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>On the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated and cannot be bind by CTCF. Without insulator protein CTCF, the enhancers access Igf2 and promote its expression. DNA methylation is also seen at H19 promoter, so that H19 gene is silenced and long noncoding RNA H19 cannot be produced.<br /><br /></div><div>On the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated and free to bind CTCF. CTCF insulates Igf2 from enhancers, so that Igf2 on maternal allele cannot be expressed. Instead, enhancers act on H19 because of chromatin looping, so that H19 gene is expressed and IncRNA H19 is produced.<br /><br /></div><div>In Wilm’s tumour, both ICRs on paternal and maternal alleles are hypermethylated. The expressions on paternal allele are not changed since its ICR should be methylated, while the expressions on maternal allele change totally – Igf2 is expressed and H19 is not – just like what happens on paternal allele. This loss of imprinting results in over expresses of Igf2 and none expresses of H19.<br /><br /></div><div>Igf2 is an oncogene which promotes growth. Too much of Igf2 enables cell replicates immortally which is one of the hallmarks of cancer.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to DNMT inhibitor class. It is a nucleoside analogue. When incorporates into the DNA, it will never release DNMT1 that comes to bind and lays down DNA methylation, so that DNA methylation cannot be maintained. Hemi-methylated DNA is the substrate of DNMT1, so Decitabine only works when DNA replicates and cell divides. Since tumour cell divides more rapidly than normal cell, it is possible for us to find a certain dose that affects tumour tissue most and normal tissue less. Decitabine reduces the DNA methylation level including CGIs. For some tumour that driven by tumour suppressor hypermethylation such as myelodysplastic syndrome, if CGIs are no longer hypermethylated and tumour suppressor genes are no longer silenced, there will be a good prognostic outcome.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. Once the abnormal methylation state is reset by epigenetic drugs, it will last in the following rounds of cell divisions until it is actively removed. It is the mitotic heritability that ensures there is an enduring effect. <br /><br /></div><div>Sensitive period means the period that epigenetic drugs could have max influences on epigenome. Epigenome is most sensitive during reprogramming, including primordial germ cell development period (younger patients) and early embryonic development period (patients who are in early pregnancy). These periods are when epigenetic marks are removed and reset, and if anything wrong during this process, there will be a huge disruption on epigenome in this cell and the cells that divides from it because of mitotic heritability. Epigenetic drugs change epigenome effectively, yet many of their precise mechanisms of action remain unknown, which brings uncertainty even irreversible consequences to those who are treated with these drugs during sensitive period. </div></div>
