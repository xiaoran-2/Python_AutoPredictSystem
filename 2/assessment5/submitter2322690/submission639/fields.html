    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are commonly found at gene promoters, and they are usually protected from methylation. However, if a CpG island is methylated, the associated gene is normally silenced. For example, X inactivation features DNA methylation of CpG islands in the inactivated X chromosome. In cancer, CpG islands are more likely to methylated and are referred to as hypermethylated. Different cancers display different sets of hypermethylated CpG islands and this hypermethylation occurs frequently in tumors. In fact, changes in methylation occur more frequently in cancers than mutations in the underlying DNA.  <br /><br />
Hypermethylation of CpG islands can contribute to cancer by silencing tumor suppressor genes. In this way, hypermethylation can play the role of a second hit in the Knudson hypothesis, potentially disabling the one remaining active copy of a tumor suppressor gene. An example is the RB gene where an inherited mutation can lead to retino blastoma if the second (good) copy of the RB gene is silenced. Cells that have suffered this type of genomic instability may be able to replicate more quickly than normal cells, due to loss of intrinsic controls, and so establish a selective advantage.
<br /><br />
The human genome contains large intergenic regions with large repetitive sections. These intergenic regions are normally heavily methylated. This is important to maintain genomic stability. Early in the progression of a cancer, hypomethylation of the intergenic regions begins to occur. Hypomethylation of intergenic regions leads to activation of repeats and transpositions. During cell division, demethylation can lead to illegitimate recombination between repeats, causing large scale disruption of the chromosomes.  Hypomethylation causes the DNA to become less densely packaged in the chromatin, and this in turn can lead to crypto promoters becoming active, causing abnormal activation of surrounding genes. Hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters can also activate associated genes, causing further disruption.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The H19/Igf2 cluster is located on chromosome 11 and is methylated in the primordial germ cells according to the parent of origin. The paternal allele is methylated at the ICR (imprint control region), but the maternal allele is not. The methylation on the paternal allele spreads to include the nearby H19 promoter, silencing that gene. On the maternal allele, CTCF insulator protein is able to bind to the unmethylated ICR. Enhancers downstream of H19 on the maternal allele are blocked by the CTCF from acting on the Igf2 gene, and they act instead on H19. On the paternal allele, the enhancers act directly on the Igf2 gene, encouraging the production of Igf2 growth factor.
<br /><br />
Beckwith Wiedemann Syndrome results from imprinting abnormalities in both the H19/Igf2 cluster and the linked Kcnq1 cluster. This syndrome can result from a mutation or deletion, two copies of the paternal chromosome 11, or disruption or loss of imprinting.  Igf2 is a growth promoting oncogene, and Cdkn1c is a tumor suppressor gene. The result of two paternal-like alleles is upregulation of Igf2 and suppression of Cdkn1c and a predisposition to tumors during embryonic development or childhood, commonly Wilm’s Tumor, a cancer of the kidney.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase inhibitors. DNMT1 is an enzyme that plays an important role in the methylation of cytosine residues.  When a cell divides, the newly replicated daughter strand must have methylation marks laid down to match the parent strand. DNMT1 moves along the strand performing this task. Decitabine is a cytosine analogue and it is incorporated into the DNA during cell replication. When DNMT1 meets this cytosine analogue in the daughter strand, it becomes irreversibly bound to it, thus ending any further methylation. 
<br /><br />
Decitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Cancer cells are primarily targeted, because they are dividing much more rapidly than normal cells. Although it is not yet clear how this class of drugs works, it may help stabilize the epigenome by reducing the silencing of tumor suppressor genes. It is also being trialed in solid tumor cancers.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation can have lasting effects on the epigenome because it is mitotically heritable. A daughter cell will receive methylation marks that are identical to its parent cell. The exception to this rule is that during periods of active epigenetic reprogramming, called sensitive periods, DNA loses much of its methylation. The creation of primordial germ cells and during the pre-implantation of the newly fertilized egg and very early embryo development are two prime sensitive periods. During primordial germ cell development, somatic methylation is removed and replaced with imprinted methylation which is often specific to whether an egg or sperm is being created. After fertilization of the egg and during early embryo development, this imprinted methylation is largely removed. Methylation is then laid down again, this time incorporating different epigenetic patterns including cell differentiation. 
<br /><br />
The epigenetic changes characteristic of cancer are targeted by drugs that block or enhance the effect of our body’s epigenetic machinery. Currently, these drugs are largely aimed at enzymatic epigenetic regulators. These types of drugs are inadvisable for women who may become pregnant or may already be in early pregnancy during treatment or in men who may father a child during this time, risking normal fetal development.</div>
