    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><span>DNA
methylation is the basis of epigenetic regulation. In cancer cells, the DNA
methylation pattern is significantly changed compared with the normal cells: CpG
islands are hypermethylated whereas the overall genome is hypomethylated. CpG
islands are found in more than half of the gene promoters and rarely methylated
in normal cells. Hypermethylation of CpG islands in cancer cells silence the
tumor suppressor genes.  Hypomethylating
of intergenic regions and repetitive elements will destabilize the chromosome.  Deletions, insertions and translocations will thus
occur more frequently and increase tumorigenesis. Another outcome could be
taken into consideration is the hypomethylation of the CpG poor promoters
although it is not as common as the hypomethylation of the intergenic regions
and repetitive elements. The oncogene is found to be activated through the
hypomethylation of the CpG poor promoters.</span><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:normal;"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial, 'sans-serif';">The paternal allele and maternal
allele are methylated in different degree in the imprinting control region
(ICR). Take H19/Igf2 cluster for example. ICR on the paternal allele is
methylated, thus CTCF binding is blocked. Methylations propagate from ICR to the
promoter of H19, and the enhancers on the downstream of H19 can activate lgf2. On
the maternal allele, ICR is not methylated, so CTCF is able to bind. Having
CTCF on the upstream, H19 is activated and the downstream enhancers are blocked.
Therefore lgf2 is repressed. When mutations make the maternal allele of
H19/lgf2 behave as the paternal allele, the imprinting is lost. Hypermethylation
of ICR will lead to overexpression of lgf2 and cause Wilm’s tumor.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine
is an epigenetic drug. It could demethylate DNA. It clears out the toxic epigenetic
mark created in cancer cells thus turns them back into normal cells. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Once
epigenetic changes such as altering DNA methylations are established, those
marks can be passed through generations. Sensitive periods would be imprinted X-inactivation and random x-inactivation<span>. In these periods, the epigenetic marks such as
methylation pattern in the X chromosome will be changed. Treating patients with
epigenetic drugs will change the epigenetic marks and affect the genomic
imprinting.</span><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
