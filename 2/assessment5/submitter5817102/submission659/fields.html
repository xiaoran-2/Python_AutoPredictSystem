    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation silences gene expression in CpG islands. In normal tissue majority of CpG islands arn't methylated. In cancer CpG islands are hypermethylated. Hypermethylation of CpG islands leads to silencing of the underlying gene. Thus if a CpG island is hypermethylated near a tumor suppressive gene this gene will be silenced and there will be no tumor suppresive activity. Methylation of CpG islands can alter gene imprinting, thus leading to disruprion in gene regulation (like in Wilm's tumor hypermethylation of maternal allele). <br />Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated. DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements helps to maintain genomic integrity. Methylation silenses criptic transcription, prevents transposition and illegitimate recombinations. In cancer these elements are hypomethelated thus these abnoralities trigger aberrations. This leads to genome instability, illegetimate recombinations  between repeats (reciprocal translocations for exmple). Hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements also leads to activation of cryptic promoters that leads to disturbance of neighbouring genes.  The repeats are activated by hypomethylation thus activation near by genes that leads to deletions, inertions and reciprocal translocations.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent. Decitabine inhibits DNA methyltranferase thus leads to hypomethylation of the DNA . Decitabine as a nucleotide analogue irreversibly binds DNMT after it is incorporated in to the DNA. This prevents hypermethylation of CpG islands. This stabilises the genome.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA mehylation is mitotically heritable, thus altering DNA methylation
can have long-lasting effects on the tissue epigenome. As DNMT inhibitors bind
to DNA irreversibly so they are replication dependent and they are transfered
from one cell to daughter cell. Sensitive periods in epigenetics are periods
when epigenetic reprogramming occurs (somatic marks are erased). Such periods
are pregestation period and premordial germ cells development. It is
inadvisable to use these drugs during sensitive periods because we can't
predict the effect of inhibition of epigenetic machinery on the growing
organism. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Methylation of the paternal allele of the H19/ Igf2 cluster includes methylation of the ICR that prevents CTCF from binding which leads to methilation  of H19 promoter. As there is no CTCF binding this enables enhancers to access Igf2 and activate it as in is prefered loop. On the maternal allele CTCF bind's to unmethylated ICR so H19 promoter is not methylated. CTCF blocks the prefered loop from the enhancers to Igf2 (silent) so it ativates the H19 promoter. However in Wilm's tumor there is methylation of ICR on both maternal and paternal alleles. This leads to double expression of the Igf2. As Igf2 is growth promoting it can activate neoplasy in tissues (kidney tumor in Wilm's tumor case).</div>
