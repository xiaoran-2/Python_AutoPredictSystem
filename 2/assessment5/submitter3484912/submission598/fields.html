    <div class="field-value">In normal cells, CpG islands when located at promoters, are unmethylated and protected from methylation. In cancer cells, CpG islands and CpG island shores become hyper methylated, often at the promoters of tumor suppressor genes; this hyper methylation is mitotically heritable and progresses with time and, along with other insults to the genome, results in the silencing of the tumor suppressing gene and development of cancer.  CpG island hyper methylation are used as biomarkers to identify tumor type and sub-types and can inform on prognosis, in some cases it is associated with metastasis, in others indicating that epigenetic therapy may be indicated.<br /><br />In normal cells, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements sequences are methylated, providing genomic stability.  Methylation keeps the nucleotides densely packed and prevents accidental deletions, insertions and translocations and illegitimate recombinations as well as suppressing the expression of oncogene. Loss of methylation, or hypo methylation, in these regions, results in genomic instability and sequence disruption by improper insertion, deletion or translocation of repetitive elements; it can activate repeats, transposons and cryptic promoters and disrupt neighboring genes.  Like hyper methylation, hypo methylation progresses with time and is mitotically inherited. Repeated demethylation of oncogenes results in oncogenes being activated and actively developing tumors.<br /><br />In conclusion, methylation of DNA, wether hyper or hypo, is highly context dependent. Hyper methylation of tumor suppressor genes or hypo mehtylaton of oncogenes contributes to the development of cancer, methylation of certain regions of the genome contributes to genome stability while the absence of methylation is required for gene expression.  Methylation is also used in tumor typing, prognosis and treatment. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprinting is associated with DNA methylation at the Imprint Control Regions( ICR). Alteration in methylation of ICR can result in loss of imprinting and disrupt gene expression. In the H19/lgf2 locus,  the paternal allele is methylated at the ICR situated between the two genes permitting the enhancers situated upstream of the H19 gene to access the lgf2 gene , methylation is also present at the promoter of H19, silencing its expression; thus the lgf2 growth promoting gene is expressed in the paternal allele and the H19 growth restricting gene is silent. In the maternal allele, the locus is un methylated and a CTCF factor binds to the ICR generating an insulator that prevents the enhancers from accessing the lgf2  and enhancing  the un methylated H19, permitting expression of the growth restricting H19 gene and silencing the lgf2 growth promoter gene therefore balancing gene expression.  In the condition called Wilm's tumor, the maternal ICR and H19 gene are methylated.  This results in H19 not being expressed, preventing the binding of CTCF to the ICR and enabling the enhancers to access the lgf2 gene.  This disruption results in over expression of growth promoting genes, and development of tumors in kidneys. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNMTi  - DNA methyl-transferase inhibitor or DNA hypomethylating agent. It is an enzyme that catalyze the transfer of methyl groups to DNA thus removing DNA methylation. Decitabine by inhibiting methylation that suppresses the tumor suppressor genes, restores the functionality of tumor suppressor genes.  Because it incorporates itself into the DNA as a substitute for cytosine bases it irreversibly binds DNMT during  replication  and has continuing effects in depleting the DNA strands of DNMT leading to permanent de methylation.  Without DNMT,  methyl groups cannot bind to DNA,  tumor suppressor genes are then protected from methylation and therefore cannot be deactivated. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Because DNMT inhibitors are nucleoside analogues, they incorporate themselves into the DNA strand and become mitotically replicated in the daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. For this reason,the use of such drugs are not recommended for a period of time pre and post conception for both males and females, as well as during pregnancy.  <br />Epigenetic marks are passed on to offsprings though germ cells and are subject to epigenetic marks reprogramming during the reproduction cycle.  This cycle is punctuated by periods of reprogramming of maternal and paternal genomes, and imprinted genes.  These periods comprises primordial germ cell and germ cell development, pre and post implementation period, to the epiblast stage , when the genome is particularly sensitive to environmental influences.  During these periods, the DNA is demethylated and methylation is reestablished during the somatic maintenance phase.  Treating patients during these periods would result in the disruption of the epigenetic cycle and cause damage to the primordial germ cell epigenome development or cause failure to establish proper methylation patterns during the bastocyst and epiblast stage.  These disruptions can cause a range of abnormalities due to improper expression or silencing of genes as well as death of the embryos. </div>
