    <h1>Submission 530 from Anon (session_user_id: 39df8a868058e08b3f87f16d79d299542f430fd9)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent. <br />This compound can inhibit the effect of DNA methyltransferases and inhibition of methylation can result in the expression of previously silenced genes (hypermethylated)<br /><span>By demethylationwith Decitabine, the normal function of the tumor suppressor genes (that tent to be silenced in cancer) is restored, regulating the cell growth as in a normal cell.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that alter DNA methylation have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment because epigenetic changes are inherited from mother to daughter cells until they disappear. In that way the demethylating agent can act over the epigenome of a cancer cell producing arresting the growth preserving the viability of the cells, but errase epigeniec changes that contribute to immortally such as hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes.<br />Sensitive period means when cells are susceptible of acquire or errase epigenetic changes<br />In development sansitive periods are when epigenetic reprogramming occures (germ cells and early development)<br />In sensitive periods imprinting genes or methylation pattern can be modified leading to alteration of normal gene expression require for maintaining the specificity of the cell type.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>•Normaly DNA
methylation is ocurring in CpG dinucleotides. CpG islands (aggregation of CpG sites often found in promoter regions of
genes) are protected from metilation. However, when CpG island metylation occures it represent the inactivation of
gene expression (silencing)</div>

<div>•In cancer, the
general pattern of methylation change from being locatated in the repetitive elements, intergenic regions
and/or introns to be mainly located in promoter regions (hypermetilation o)
specially of tumor suppressor genes.</div>

<div>•Alteration
of CpG
islands methylation in <span>cancer
can lead to  loss of expression of growth
</span>arresting
genes or overexpression
of growth promoting genes.
Through cancer progress (from
hyperplastic tissue to invasion of the cancer) the CpG
island methylation is in general increasing.</div>

<div>•DNA
methylation at intergenic
regions and repetitive elements is related to maintein genome stability because methylation in intergenic
regions helps
to silence cryptic
transcription start sites or cryptic splice <span>sites; and methylation in repetitive
elements prevents transposition in the genome and  </span>illegitimate combination and avoid
transcriptional interference from strong promoters </div>

<div>•In cancer, DNA hypomethylation at intergenic
regions and repetitive elements
contribute to genome inestability as a
result of Illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of
repeats and transposition or activation of
cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring
genes.</div>

<div>•In a cancer context, deletion or mutations in
Dnmt1 or
Dnmt3b contribute to genome-wide hypomethylation as observed in
animal models and
human disease producing genomic inestability. Additionally CpG island hypermethylation is associated
with
clinically distinct tumours and
loss of imprinting.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>One
characteristic occuring in
cancer is the lost of imprinting, cancer cells may show genes expressed from
both parental alleles or silence from both parental alleles</div>

<div>In
the paternal allele of the <span>cluster Igf2/H19</span> in a normal cell we can found that the imprint
control region is methylated , the insulator CTCF can not bind it. The
enhancers are acting over Igf2 instead of H19, so Igf2 is expressed from the patternal
allele.</div>

<div><span>In
the maternal allele of the cluster Igf2/H19 the insulator CTCF can bind the
imprint control region because the lather is not methylated. So the enhancers
act over H19 expressing it, instead  of
acting over Igf2, that in this case is not expressed from the maternal allele.</span></div>

<div>In
Will's tumor lost of imprinting occure because both imprint control regions
maternal and paternal are methylated , the insulator CTCF can not
bind it. The enhancers are acting over Igf2 instead of H19, so Igf2 is
expressed in
double dose leading to higher expression of Igf2. which is a growth promoting
gene. This effect contribute to cancer because malignant cells will be more
prone to growth and proliferate.</div>
