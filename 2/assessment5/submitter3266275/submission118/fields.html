    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value">CpG islands act as promoters for tumor suppressor genes. In normal cells theses islands are hypomethylated which allow these genes to be expressed. Whereas in cancer cell these islands are hypermethylated which silence tumor suppressors genes, and hence favors uncontrollable cell division. <br />Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are heavily methylated in normal cells, so they are densely packed in heterochromatine. Intergenic regions and Repeats are hypomethylated which undermines the genetic stability by adding deletions, insertion, and translocations. H<span>ypomethylated repeats favors the activation and illegitimate </span>recombination of these repeats. This will disrupt the normal functioning of genes in the regions where these repeats have migrated to. Other hypomethylation in intergenic region include CpG poor promoters, which results in promoting the neighboring genes.<br />In the context of Cancer, hypomethylation leads to the expression of encogenes which are normally silenced.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the paternal allele the Imprinted Control Region is methylated, so the CTCF does not bind to this insulator which will allow the Enhancers located downstream to overpass the methylated gene H19 and express Igf2 genes. <br />Whereas in Maternal allele, CTCF binds to the Imprinted Control Region, the Igf2 is silenced as the Enhancers are prevented prevent the to interact with Igf2, and instead promote the expression of H19. <br />In Wilm's tumor, in both paternal and maternal allele the imprinted Control Region and H19 gene are methylated which,  hence the Promoters express Igf2 in both alleles. Igf2 gene is expressed from both parental alleles results in a double dose of Igf2.<br />Igf2 is growth promoting gene, and the over-expression of  Igf2 is associated with Wilm's tumor where the kidney cells grow in uncontrollable manner. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine inhibits DNA methyltransferase enzymes (DNMTi).  <br />Decitabine molecules are incorporated to the DNA during replication (cell division), and inhibits methyltransferase which lead to the demethylation of the nearby DNA region when passed down to the daughter cell. <br />In the context of cancer the hypomethylation <span>reactivates silenced tumor suppressor genes</span><span>. <br /></span><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically inheritable, epigenetic changes are passed on to the daughter cell and so on, therefore altering DNA methylation can have lasting effects on the epigenome.  <br />There are sensitive periods in the life cycle such as preimplantation/early development or primordial germ cell development where the epigenetic reprogramming occurs, as it is the case for the genetically imprinted genes.<br />Altering the epigenetic re-programming could have a serious impact such as over-expression of imprinted genes, or activation of repeats which could be detrimental. </div>
