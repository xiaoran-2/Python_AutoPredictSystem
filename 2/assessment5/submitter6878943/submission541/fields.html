    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, most CpG
islands are found near of transcription initiation regions of genes(promoter regions)
 and then the cytosines are not
methylated. Therefore, the CpG islands are hypomethylated, and have very low
methylation patterns. However, in cancer cells, this contradicts and the CpG
islands become hypermethylated, using this change in epigenoma, as an
alternative to genetic mutations. With the hypermethylation of CpG islands in
cancer cells, several genes related to the control of tumor development, become
methylated. Tumor suppression genes like p14, p15, p16,
p73 and BRCA1, DNA repair genes like hMLH1 and MGMT,  and invasion and metastasis (CDH1, ECAD,
TIMP1, TIMP2, TIMP3 and DAPK) are silenced. Therefore, the hypermethylation of
CpG islands has been identified in several types of tumors, contributing to the
development of cancer.</p><p><span>Unlike Cpg islands, normal
cells have their repetitive elements and intergenic regions highly methylated.
Repetitive elements may present very similar sequences, which could result in
an illegitimate recombination of repetitive, compromising genomic stability.
Because these elements are hypermethylated and are in heterochromatin, this
does not happen in normal cells and genomic stability is maintained. In cancer
cells, hypermethylation is lost, occurring hypomethylation of repetitive
elements and intergenic regions, making them active. This can lead to genomic
instability of the cell due to illegitimate recombination between the
repetitive, activation of transposons and repetitive, activation of hidden
promoter regions and disruption of neighboring genes and the emerging of mutations like deletions, translocations and chromosomal gain. This epigenetic
alteration and consequently genomic instability is also found in several types of tumors and contributes to cancer
development.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>What happens with the H19/lgf2
cluster in cancer cells is an example of hypermethylation of ICR ( Imprinting Control Region) and loss of
imprinting. Genes that should be expressed monoallelic, in other words, are
imprinted, become expressed in both
alleles, as is the case of lgf2 in Wilm's tumor.</p><p>

</p><p>The paternal allele has its
methylated ICR. When this ICR is methylated, there isn’t binding of insulator
element CTCF, and the enhancers can act on LGF2 gene that will be expressed in
the paternal allele. In contrast, the maternal allele is unmethylated and CTCF
can bind to and prevent the action of enhancers in LGF2. Instead, they act on
H19. Thus LGF2 is imprinted and expressed only the paternal allele, while, H19
is expressed in the maternal allele. However, in wild's tumor, occurs ICR
hypermethylation of the maternal allele and loss of imprinting. Then, the CTCF
will not bind and the enhancers will act on LGF2, which will expressed on the
maternal allele too. Thus, there is a double dose of LGF2 expression compared
to a normal cell. How LGF2 is a promoter of growth, this will contribute to the
development of cancer, in this case, the development of Wilm's tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The
decitabine belongs to a class of DNA methyltransferases inhibitors drugs, in
other words, it prevents the methylation of DNA by methyltransferases and has
the capability of prevents hypermethylation-induced gene silencing. The
decitabine acts like the azacitidine. Both are incorporated into DNA. After
binding to DNA, decitabine binds covalently with methyltransferases. By binding
to decitabine, the methyltransferases are depleted and so are unavailable to DNA
methylation, resulting in significant demethylation after repeated
replications. Demethylation by decitabine has been shown to allow re-expression
of silenced genes and cellular differentiation. Additionally, incorporation of
these agents into RNA causes ribosomal disassembly, defective tRNA function and
inhibited protein production</p>

<p><span> We know that in cancer, many promoter regions
of tumor suppressor genes are highly methylated throughout the oncogenic
process. The decitabine can then act on the methyltransferases, preventing the
methylation of these regions and re-expressing suppressor genes that were
silenced, presenting anti-tumor effect.</span></p><p>OBS: Answer based in " DNA methyltransferase inhibitors—state of the art" </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>  <br /></p>

<p>These drugs can alter epigenetic homeostasis of direct and
indirect ways. Direct effects may cause effects on nuclear architecture and in
DNA methylation. The indirect effects can influence on signaling pathways that
could lead to a change in transcriptional activity in gene promoters. With more
"chronic exposure" cells can adapt to permanent changes in DNA
methylation and chromatin structure leading to enduring effects of treatment.
Furthermore, it is known that epigenetic effects can be mitotically inheritable,
then once happen an epigenetic change, this change may be transmitted for daughter
cells, in other words, there is a transgenerational epigenetic inheritance.</p>

<p>These effects can
be further attenuated if epigenetic alterations occur during periods of
development called sensitive periods. As the name implies, these periods are
periods more sensitive to environmental changes and are periods of constant
remodeling of the epigenome. There are two sensitive periods: the first period
is the period of development of primordial germ cells for the production of
eggs and sperm. The second sensitive period is the period of pre-developmental
and post-developmental period, which are periods of active remodeling of the
epigenome. So, if you treat patientes during this periods, this epigenetic changes can be more attenuated and the patient can suffer of epigenetic effects longer.</p></div>
