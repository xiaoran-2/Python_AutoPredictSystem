    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">ICR of paternal allele of H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated, and downstream enchansers can act with Igf2 (located upstream from ICR). IGF2 is expressed from the paternal allele. ICR of maternal allele is unmethylated and insulator alement CTCF binds with ICR and enchancers can act with H19 (but can not with Igf2). Consequently H19 is expressed, igf2 is not expressed. In Wilm's tumors cells maternal allele is also methylated and we have double-dose of Igf2. As a result we have increase of growth factors in tumor cells and unregulated cell cycle.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are frequently located at promoter regions and control gene expression. CpG methylation reduce gene expression. CpG islands are hypermethylated in cancer cells that cause transcriptional silencing of tumor suppressor genes - controlling cell cycle, DNA repair, apoptosis. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated and inactive in normal cells. In cancer cells they become hypomethylated. Hypomethylation of repetitive elements and intergenic intervals leads to genomic instability (deletions, insertions, translocations)</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is DNA methyltrasferase inhibitor. It is nucleoside analogues, incorporated into DNA during replication, irreversibly binds DNMTs, inhibits methyltransferase1 thereby causing demethylation in that sequence, and in daughter cells. This results in hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis. Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation. <span>Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to decitabine. So, fast proliferative cancer cells become more differentiated or died from apoptosis.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can change transcriptional status of different genes. For exsemple it may lead to silencing of tumor (growth factors) supressors and activatinf of pro-oncogenes (growth factors - EGF, FGF, cyclins). Sensitive period is time poit when cell is sensitive to changes in epigeneic reprograming (modifications). Sensitive periods of development - primordial germ cells origin and development (sensitive period for imprinted genes), blastocyst formation, determination and differentiation of somatic cells. Treatinf patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable becouse epigenetic regulation is not complete and is in period in formation</div>
