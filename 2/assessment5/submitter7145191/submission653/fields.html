    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation is a common epigenetic
signaling tool that plays a crucial role in regulation of gene expression through
CpG islands present on promoter region of the gene. Aberrant DNA methylation, a
covalent chemical modification of DNA occurring at cytosine residues in CpG
dinucleotide, is the most common epigenetic lesion of cancer cells and linked
to silencing of repetitive DNA elements (RE). Majority of these RE elements are
inactivated by DNA methylation or by mutations acquired over time as the result
of the deamination of 5mC. DNA methylation changes in repetitive elements (REs)
are associated with the regulation of gene transcription, embryonic
development, differentiation and carcinogenesis. It
affects all cellular pathways with a tumor-type specific profile, and in
addition to classical tumor-suppressor and DNA repair genes, it includes genes
involved in premature aging and microRNAs with growth inhibitory functions. ~45%
of the mammalian genome consists of transposable and viral elements that are
silenced by DNA methylation. In particular, long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1)
and short interspersed elements (SINEs) that continue to affect our genome, and
their movement can lead to sporadic cases of disease. These elements are
potentially harmful as their replication and insertion can lead to gene
disruption and that cause hypomethylation of CpG di-nucleotides and leads to genomic
instability. As a result, high frequency of genomic mutations increases that
activate oncogenes and inactivate tumor suppressor genes, contribute to cancer.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>In most somatic cells <i>Igf2</i> and the neighboring <i>H19</i>
gene are reciprocally imprinted; <i>Igf2</i> gene expression is silenced on the
maternal allele, whereas <i>H19</i> is silenced on the paternal allele. This
allele-specific expression is associated with allele-specific DNA methylation
at several differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in the <i>Igf2</i> gene and
at the <i>Igf2/H19</i> imprinting control region (ICR) located immediately
upstream of the <i>H19</i> promoter. The ICR contains four
methylation-sensitive CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) binding-sites mediating the
assembly of a chromatin insulator that blocks interactions between the <i>Igf2</i>
promoter and enhancers downstream of the <i>H19</i> gene. On the unmethylated
maternal allele, CTCF binds to the ICR silencing <i>Igf2</i> expression and
stimulating the transcription of <i>H19</i>. Loss of imprinting (LOI) is the
most common molecular abnormality in Wilms’ tumor (WT). LOI in WT involves
activation of the normally silent maternal allele of the <i>insulin-like growth
factor-II</i> (<i>IGF2</i>) gene. The mechanisms and methylation events
underlying the LOI at <i>H19</i> and <i>IGF2</i> vary from tumour to tumour,
however, maternal allele methylation is commonly acquired at sequences that
include the <i>H19</i> promoter and <i>IGF2</i> enhancer blocker, which can
simultaneously silence <i>H19</i> and activate <i>IGF2</i> that cause a
consequence of neoplastic transformation.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a
member of a new class of drugs known as DNA ‘demethylating’ agents.  When
DNA methylation increase this can result in the blockage of the activity of
"suppressor genes" that regulate cell division and growth. 
Decitabine inhibits DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), depletes DNMT1 through proteosomal
degradation and induces global DNA hypomethylation, and increases expression of
specific genes through mechanisms both dependent on as well as independent of promoter
hypomethylation. Decitabine belongs to two classes of medications because it seems
to work in two ways. First, it is a demethylating agent and secondly, it is an
antimetabolite. Antimetabolites are very similar to normal substances within
the cell.  When the cells incorporate these substances into the cellular
metabolism, they interact with a number of targets within the cell to produce a
direct cytotoxic effect that causes death of rapidly dividing cancer cells.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation, is critical to maternal effects on gene
expression and thus generate phenotypic differentiation of offspring through
effects on maternal behavior of offspring, mediate the transmission of these
effects across generations. However, these global interventions may interfere
with ordinary functioning of the system, especially during sensitive periods, ­­
the time where extensive epigenetic reprogramming occurs i.e. early embryonic development
and in primordial germ cells. In particular, it would be inadvisable to
prescribe these treatments to pregnant mothers (including a<span> few months before conception) as a lot of reprogramming
happens in early child development as well as during the formation of gametes.</span></span></p></div>
