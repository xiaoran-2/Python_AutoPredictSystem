    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value">The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to prevent specific genes from being expressed.In cancer cells the CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated which causes silencing of the tumour suppresor gene.This type of epigenetic mutation is dangerous when genes that regulate 
the cell cycle are silenced, allowing cells to grow and reproduce 
uncontrollably, leading to tumorigenesis.In intergenic regions and repetitive elements DNA methylation tends to inactivate elements that,if they were active,would potentially be harmful as their replication and insertion can lead to gene disruption and DNA mutation.In cancer,the intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to become hypomethylated which eventually leads to genomic instability,including illegitimate recombination of repeats,activion of repeats and transposition and activation of cryptic promoters that causes disruption of the neighbouring genes.This chromosomal instability is known to be enhancing tumorigenesis.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In humans, the Igf2 gene and adjacent H19 non-coding RNA are clustered in an imprinted region on the short arm of chromosome
         11.The cluster is regulated by an ICR, which contains multiple binding sites for
         the insulator protein CTCF, the critical site referred to as CTCF6.An unmethylated IGF2/H19 ICR on the maternal allele allows binding of CTCF which blocks transcription of IGF2 and activates H19, in turn inhibiting growth. Conversely, on the paternal allele, IGF2/H19 ICR methylation activates IGF2 transcription and silences H19.In Wilm's tumour there is a change in H19 methylation which activates the maternal Igf2 gene,meaning that we have biallelical expression of that gene.Since both the paternal and the maternal copies of 
the gene are active,the amount of Igf2 that cells can produce is increased.This phenomenon is known as loss of 
imprinting.An increased amount of insulin-like growth factor 2 
may stimulate the growth of tumor cells and prevent damaged cells from 
being destroyed.That means that the cells multiply uncontrolably and go on living when other cells would die.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor.Decitabine can be incorporated DNA strands and therefore it hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase.Decitabine's anticancer effects are believed to be two-fold.One way
            that it works is by demethylation or interfering with the methylation of DNA. 
            By this process of demethylation, normal function to the tumor suppressor genes
            is restored, thus restoring control over cell growth.Decitabine also belongs to the category of chemotherapy called antimetabolites.Antimetabolites are very similar to normal substances within the cell.  When
            the cells incorporate these substances into the cellular metabolism, they interact
            with a number of targets within the cell to produce a direct cytotoxic effect that
            causes death of rapidly dividing cancer cells.

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is proved to be heritable during cell division and differentation throught transcription.This heritability of methylation state depends on certain enzymes (such as DNMT1) that have a higher affinity for 5-methylcytosine than for cytosine.In developmental biology, a critical period
 is a phase in the life span during which an organism has heightened 
sensitivity to exogenous stimuli that are compulsory for the development
 of a particular skill. If the organism does not receive the appropriate
 stimulus during this "critical period", it may be difficult, ultimately
 less successful, or even impossible, to develop some functions later in
 life.As sensitive periods we recognize the important stages of childhood development.It is generally believed that early life constitutes a period during 
which there is increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of 
epigenetic mechanisms.Such periods are the prenatal stages and early childhood,sometimes even adolesence.It is logical that treating patients during such sensitive developmental periods is inadvisable mainly because the drugs could affect in a wrong way several epigenetic mechanisms or disrupt specific epigenetic processes,and by that creating new problems to the young organism which will be carried to later life and,likely,to offsprings.<br /></div>
