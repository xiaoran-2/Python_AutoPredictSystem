    <div class="field-value"><p><span>During
cancer, there is a regional gain of DNA methylation and genome wide
hypomethylation. One example of regional gain of DNA methylation is the high
frequency of DNA methylation at CpG rich sites (called CIMP – <b>C</b>pG <b>i</b>sland <b>m</b>ethylator <b>p</b>henotype). A normal cell is having
unmethylated CpG island, whereas, in a cancer cell, the CpG island is
hypermethylated. </span></p>

<p><span>CpG
are found in the promoters of most genes. In the genome, CpG islands are
usually protected from methylation. If CpG is methylated, it silences the gene
expression, as meCpG island is associated with the formation of
repressive chromatin structure via MeCP1 and 2. DNA methylation of CpG island
is also associated with inactive X-chromosome. The hypermethylated CpG island
is also associated with tumor suppression and the identity of hypermethylated
CGIs varies by tumour type. The hypermethylated CpG island is found in many
cancer types, viz RB in retinoblastoma, MLH1 in colorectal cancer, BRCA1 in
breast cancer and MGMT in gliomas and colorectal tumour. Another such region of
DNA hypermethylation is the CpG island shores, which are about 2 kb region
surrounding CpG island.</span></p>

<p><span>Most
of the genome is composed of intergenic region and repetitive elements. In a
normal cell, intergenic region, repetitive elements and even the gene introns
are methylated. The function of this methylation is to maintain genomic
stability. As compared to a normal cell, in a cancer cell, the intergenic
region, repetitive elements and gene introns are hypomethylated. The
hypomethylation of all these regions may results in illegitimate recombination
between repeats. In some cases, the hypomethylation activates the repeats,
which may then make a copy of themselves and disrupt the neighboring gene by
transposing in their CDS (coding sequences). It may also cause the activation
of cryptic promoters.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span> <i>H19/Igf2</i> presents the insulator model of
imprinting. In this model, the paternally expressed <i>Igf2</i> gene and maternally expressed <i>H19</i> gene share enhancers. </span>On
the paternal allele, the ICR (imprinting control region) is methylated, thereby
preventing CTCF binding. The methylation of ICR spreads to H19 promoter and
silences it. Both these activities permit the enhancers to access <i>Igf2</i>. In
the case of maternal allele, ICR is unmethylated, therefore, CTCF along with
its cofactors bind to it. The formation of this complex at ICR blocks the
enhancer from interacting with <i>Igf2</i>
and thereby, allow the enhancer to access the H19 promoter.</p>

<p><span>As
we know, in gene imprinting, there is monoallelic expression of the genes, but
sometimes imprinting genes does not behave like being imprinted. In these
cases, the gene may express from both the alleles, or it may not express from
the either allele. A large number of imprinting genes are involved in growth
i.e. these genes are either growth promoting or growth suppressing. One of the
most common features of the cancer is the loss of imprinting. In Wilm’s tumour,
the hypermethylation of ICR disrupt the imprinting at <i>H19/Igf2</i> cluster. In this case, maternal ICR is also methylated
along with paternal ICR, thereby <i>Igf2 </i>expresses
from both the alleles. And <i>Igf2</i> being
growth promoting, its double dose leads to cancer.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Unlike
mutations, epimutations are reversible and therefore, the enzymes involved in
epigenetic regulation are the main focus for drug development against cancer
because the enzymatic function can be easily targeted with small molecule
inhibitors.</p>

<p><span>Decitabine
is a FDA approved drug against cancer and it belongs to the class of DNMTi (DNA
methyl transferase inhibitor). DNMTi are nucleoside analogues. During DNA
replication, they get incorporated in the DNA, acted upon by DNMTs and the
methyl group is transferred to the daughter strand. DNMTs bind irreversibly to
these nucleoside analogues. As cancer cells divide much more rapidly than
normal cells, so, cancer cells are more severally affected. The mechanism of
action of DNMTi on cancer is not very clear. However, it can be speculated that
the mechanism is dependent upon CpG hypermethylation and therefore associated
with tumour suppression. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic
changes or alterations are mitotically inherited i.e. these alterations are
passed on to daughter and granddaughter cells during cell division until they
are erased during epigenetic reprogramming. As DNA methylation is an epigenetic
modification which is mitotically inherited, it is possible that altering DNA
methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome and make them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy.</p>

<p>Sensitive
periods are the periods of epigenetic reprogramming. There are two phases of
epigenetic reprogramming viz. (1) early embryonic development (pre-implantation
period) and (2) primordial germ cell development. During these periods, there
is clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks in paternal and maternal genomes.
</p>

<p><span>The
drugs used for the treatment of cancer are the ones that target the enzymes
involved in epigenetic machinery, e.g. DNMTi . These drugs cannot differentiate
between a normal cell and a cancerous cell. The cancer cells are more affected
by these drugs solely because of their ability to divide rapidly. But the side
effects of these drugs have been seen in normal cells. As sensitive period involves
epigenetic reprogramming, any sort of side effect on epigenome of normal cells
will be inherited in the daughter cells and therefore, all the cell lineages
will be affected, therefore, it is not advisable to treat patients during
sensitive periods.</span></p></div>
