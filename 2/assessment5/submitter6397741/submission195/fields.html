    <h1>Submission 195 from Anon (session_user_id: a7c358d497e6763740e94c9d9c6838c61145e348)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine a chemical analogue of cytidine. When it incorporated in the DNA or RNA, it inhibits DNA methytransferase. DNA cannot be methylated at the position occupied by Decitabine resulting in reduction in DNA methylation. <br />In tumor cells, CpG islands are hypermethylated which leads to silencing of tumor suppressing genes. Decitabine enters the cell and gets incorporated into the gene during DNA replication leading to methylation removal for tumor suppressor gene. Thus tumor suppressor genes begin express again showing anti-tumor effect. The cancer cells grow faster than normal cells thus taking up more decibabine. Thus Decitabine exerts its toxic effect on tumor cells.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value">There are two DNA methylation phenomenon seen in cancer, locus specific DNA hyper methylation and genome wide DNA hypomethylation. These DNA methylation alteration will result in genetic and epigenetic 
error accumulation leading to transformation of a normal cell into an 
invasive or metastatic tumor. <br /><br />In normal cells, CpG islands are not methylated. In cancer cells, CpG islands of single gene or a set of genes and CpG islands shores of tumor suppressor genes are hypermethylated. The unusual hypermethylation of CpG islands is termed CIMPs. CIMPs are found to be associated with different types of cancer. These tumor suppressor genes, such as RB, MLH1, BRCA1, involve in cell cycle control, DNA damage repair etc.. When CpG islands and CpG island shores proceeding and/or around tumor suppressor genes are hypermethylated, the tumor suppressor genes become silent. Damaged DNA will not get corrected efficiently. Thus genomic instability increase which lead to uncontrolled tumor genesis and cancer.<br />ICRs hypermethylation clould lead to loss of imprinting which lead to overexpression of growth promoting genes thus resulting in cancer.<br /><br />In normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are heavily methylated. While in cancer cells, these regions become hypomethylated. Disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements allow recombination and transposition occur resulting in genomic instability. The illegitimate recombination between repeats lead to loss of function due to large piece of DNA missing or generation of fusion DNA. It can also activate cryptic promoters and disrupt neighboring genes.<br />CpG poor promoters of oncogene (i.e. R-RAS) or gene that targets tumor suppressor gene (i.e. miR21) when not methylated become activated and lead to overexpression and uncontrolled cell growth. <br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Igf2 and H19 cluster are separated with Imprint control region (ICR) which is methylated on paternal allele and not methylated on maternal allele. In normal cell, CTCF binds to the unmethylated ICR which is on the maternal allele and the enhancer can bind to H19 enable its expression and silence the Igf2 expression. On the paternal allele, due to methylation on the ICR and the promoter of H19, CTCF cannot bind to ICR, thus enhancer binds to Igf2 enable its expression while H19 is silenced. Loss of imprinting occurs in Wilm's tumor with both maternal and paternal allele methylated at ICRs. Expression of Igf2 are from both maternal and paternal alleles resulting in double dose of Igf2. Igf2 is growth promoting gene. Its increase in expression leads to cancer. <br />Disrupting imprinting at H19/Igf2 cluster, hypermethylation of ICRs, result in loss of growth suppress gene and overexpression of growth promoting gene, which leads to cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic state is mitotically heritable. The methylation state of DNA is maintained through development. Thus once DNA methylation state is established, it remains unchanged and is passed to the daughter cell and so on. This is also the reason why once DNA methylation state is altered, it has the life long enduring effects on the epigenome. <br /><br />The sensitive period is the time when epigenetic mark is in reprogramming during germ cells formation and early development of embyo, fetus. Thus prenatal and early postnatal development stages are sensitive periods. Young children especially at the age of 9-12 for boy and 8-11 for girls when they go through purberty,  women before pregnant, during pregnant and nursing are in sensitive period as well. <br /><br />Treating patients during sensitive periods will affect epigenetic stage on not only the tumor cells but also normal cells. Changing normal cells epigenetic marks will have adverse effect for the patients' life. Thus it is inadvisable and should be avoid.<br /></div>
