    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">The CpG islands are short DNA sequences that are really different from the genomic DNA by being GC-rich (at least 200pb with more than 50% CGs). These CGIs sites are the usually the place of transcription initiation. Therefore, methylations of these islands can silence entire genes from being transcripts, and alter the protein cascades. If this happens to genes that are responsible in cell control and arrest of the cell proliferation cycle, can be responsible to induce certain types of cancers.<br />Transcription starts randomly all over the genome, even in nonspecific areas. Therefore, methylation in this intergenics and repetitive elements, prevents this unspecific (lower the rate of happening) transcriptions where they weren't suppose to happen. In cancer, some of these regions that should be methylated, aren't. Therefor, it opens spaces to the transcriptions of unwanted RNAi and other types of RNAs that can influence others.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">First let me define imprinting: <span>Differential expression of a gene that depends on the sex of the parent that transmitted the gene. If the gene is inherited from the father, its expression is different than if it is inherited from the mother.<br /></span>Wilms' tumor is a type of embryonic kidney cancer that is associated with the <i>IGF2</i>/<i>H19</i> locus. <i>IGF2 </i>codes for insulin-like growth factor that is express in various tumors, and <i>H19</i><span> is a noncoding</span>RNA<span> that can suppress growth.<br /></span>These are imprinted, where only the maternal copy of <i>H19</i><span> is expressed and the paternal (but not the maternal) copy of </span><i>IGF2</i><span> is expressed. When these genes lose their imprinting, it can induce cancer. As said before IGF is found to be present in various types of cancers, especially for being a type of grow factor. What is known is that <em>H19 </em>is responsible to suppress <em>IGF2</em>. Therefore, the loss of the expression of <em>H19</em> can be responsible for over expression of <em>IGF2</em>.</span><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the types of drugs that are responsible for DNA-demethylating. This means that this drug is responsible for by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase, therefor, inhibiting methylation. This drug can have an anti-tumor effect because its capable of <span>shuting down </span><i>Myc</i>-activated genes and slowed the proliferation of myeloma cells. <span>This particular transcription factor is involved in the expression of about 15% of human genes, and the genes refulated by it, are one's of the most common causes of cancers.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can silences the genes, these alterations, depending on the stage of development stage of the individual (a more sensitive period), can be responsible to cause heritable changes in gene activity. It is generally believed that during the early <span>perinatal </span>period there is increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms. Further sensitive periods happens when meiosis is occurring in the female germline to generate the primary oocytes and puberty when generating the secondary oocytes,<br />Treating patients during these sensitive periods can alter their gametes or the fetus during pregnancy, causing an elevated risk for diseases like cancers, syndromes or even premature death of the offspring.</div>
