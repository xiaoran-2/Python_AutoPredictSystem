<p class="MsoNormal">In normal cells, CpG islands are not methylated and the intergenic
and repetitive element regions of DNA are methylated.<span>  </span>The lack of methylation of CpG islands in
normal cells is beneficial because tumor suppression genes at these sites can then
actively transcribe enzymes used by the cell to attack and kill abnormal cancer
cells.<span>  </span>Methylation of intergenic and
repetitive regions in normal cells is beneficial in normal cells because it
shuts down transcription in these regions that would otherwise result in the proliferation
of transposons (jumping genes), oncogene activation, CpG poor promoters, and duplication
of repetitive elements throughout the cell genome.<span>  </span>These factors are disruptive to the cell
genome and are known to contribute to the development of cancer cells. <span> </span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprints must be
epigenetically marked by parental origin so the correct allele specific
expression patterns are present in all somatic cells. The H19/Igf2 cluster is
expressed exclusively from either the maternally or paternally inherited
chromosomes. In maternal expression, H19 is expressed whereas
in paternal expression, Igf2 is expressed. These genes share enhancers and their reciprocal imprinting is governed by a CTCF dependent
insulator located between them. On
the maternal chromosome in the mouse, CTFC binds to 4 binding sites within the ICR
generating an insulator preventing Igf2 from accessing shared enhancers located
on the H19 side of the insulator. On the
paternal chromosome, methylation at the ICR prevents CTFC from
binding, allowing Igf2 to engage the enhancers, and silences
H19. The Ifgf2 gene is an insulin-like growth factor that is active
throughout embryogenesis and fetal growth. In normal human tissues, only the paternal Igf2 allele is expressed. Hypo-methylation at
the Igf2 DMRs resulting in elevated Igf2 circulating levels have been associated with an increased risk of developing cancers
such as Wilm’s tumor, colorectal cancer and ovarian cancer as well as diabetes and obesity.   </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA de-methylating agent meaning that it
reduces methylation of DNA at CpG promoter island regions.  It does this by inhibiting the production of
DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) and is therefore classified as a DNMT
inhibitor.  DNMT is an enzyme required to
maintain DNA methylation at the DNA promoter site.  The resulting decrease in methylation at the
promoter site of a tumor suppressor gene allows the gene to become more
transcriptionally active resulting in more effective suppression of cancer
cells.  Decitabine has been approved by
the FDA for use treating haemetological malignancies. One drawback is that its
action is non-specific meaning it effects the entire epigenome and therefore
adverse side effects are a concern.  </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs and other environmental factors that alter DNA
methylation can remain intact through future cell divisions (mitosis) and
remain stable for the life of the organism. 
However, there are certain sensitive periods in the mammalian lifespan when
these epigenetic markers are susceptible to  erasure or reprogramming.  These sensitive periods occur during
gametogenesis (gamete production), embryonic development, and organ differentiation
and development.  Therefore, when treating
epigenetic conditions through manipulation of methylation or other epigenetic
markers that cannot be specifically targeted, one must especially be concerned
about unintended side-effects when treatment is administered during these
sensitive periods.  For this reason,
there is a greater risk of adverse long term side effects when epigenetic treatments
are administered during these sensitive periods as compared to the mature
adult.         </p>
