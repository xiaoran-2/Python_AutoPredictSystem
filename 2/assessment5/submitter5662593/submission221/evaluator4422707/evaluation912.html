    <div class="field-value">Hi! For question 1, cancer is associated with CpG island hypermethylation, and this is because the CpG dinucleotides found in or near the promoter of those genes which are  transcriptionally active become methylated when they are not supposed to be. This is why I gave you a score of 1 for the first 2 subset of question 1. I was looking for you to indicate how these CpG islands go from being unmethylated in normal cells to cancer cells: (by hypermethylation).
In the same sense, in cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements lose their epigenetic mark (methylation) which was present in normal cells, and become hypomethylated. I was looking for this key term. This is why again, I gave you partial responses for the question subset for part 1. You did an excellent job, however, in describing the effect of this hypomethylation on the genome as a whole, and its contribution to cancer. Well done!

You discuss the CTCF insulator binding ICR for the maternal allele on the chromosome for the mouse in your response to question 2, but I think that in the context of what is being asked for this assignment, we are only to take into account humans. I don't mean to offend you, but did you happen to copy directly from some texts? I only ask this because of the type of language/phraseology that I observed as I was reading your responses, and the manner in which your response was written. It looks like most of it was directly copied from some scientific journal. Okay, so I gave you a score of 0 for your response for the maternal allele description of IGf2 expression because you are discussing the mouse model (it looks like you go from the mouse model to the human model), and I feel that you copied directly from some texts. 
So overall, I gave you 0 for the remainder of the subset and your only score is for your response for the paternal allele ICR which, as you correctly describe, does not permit the CTCF insulator protein to bind so that downstream enhancers are free to activate IGf2, in order that IGf2 is expressed only from the paternal allele.
 I didn't see any response for how disrupted imprinting contributes to childhood cancers. Again I was looking for simple key terms such as loss of imprinting, disrupted imprinting, IGf2 overexpression, IGf2 is growth-promoting (which is why its overexpression leads to an increased risk of cancer).

For ques. 4: But what are the effects, especially since there is a disruption when administering these types of drugs during sensitive periods? Altered oocyte production or altered spergmatogenesis? How does an epigenetic inhibitor cause an irreversible effect on the maternal or paternal genome during the first phase of epigenetic reprogramming for example? In what manner are these sensitive periods directly affected (like for example considering the germ line of female patients) if they are administered an epigenetic inhibitor? I believe that this was the question posed for the last subset.
