    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell, CpG islands are usually unmethylated in order to act as gene promoters, allowing gene expression. When a CpG island is methylated, gene expression is silenced. In cancer, CpG islands become hypermethylated over time, which causes the silencing of tumor suppressor genes. This could then cause tumorigenesis. As for intergenic regions and repetitive elements, these areas are normally methylated to maintain genomic stability. For example, methylated intergenic regions silence cryptic transcription start sites and cryptic splice sites. Methylated repetitive elements help prevent illegitimate recombinations between repeats, such as reciprocal translocations. In cancer, these intervals are hypomethylated over time, which allows for illegitimate recombinations, activates repeats and transpositions, and activates cryptic promoters, overall increasing genomic instability. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the paternal allele of a normal cell, the ICR between H19 and Igf2 is methylated due to imprinting. The methylated ICR blocks the CTCF protein from binding with it. Without CTCF binding, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence it, and the enhancers can then access Igf2 to activate it. In the maternal allele of a normal cell, the ICR is unmethylated, allowing CTCF to bind to it, insulating Igf2 from the enhancers. Therefore, the enhancers promote H19 instead of Igf2. In Wilm's tumor, imprinting is disrupted due to hypermethylation of the ICR. The hypermethylation causes the ICR of the maternal allele to become methylated, which causes Ifg2 to be expressed in both parental alleles. A person with a double dose of growth-promoting Ifg2 will develop Wilm's tumor. Alterations of DNA methylation at ICRs can result in a loss of growth-repression genes or an overexpression of growth-promoting genes, which can lead to tumor growth.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine, a DNMT inhibitor, is used to bind DNMT, preventing methylation. It has been FDA approved for use to treat myelodysplastic syndrome that has progressed to AML. It works in small doses to increase DNA demethylation on tumor-suppressor genes that are hypermethylated. By lowering the methylation of the hypermethylated (and therefore silenced) tumor-suppressor genes, the drug may reverse the epimutation and reactivate the tumor-suppressor gene, creating an anti-tumor effect.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that alter DNA methylation have lasting effects because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. By changing the DNA methylation in cancer cells, genes that were silenced can be reactivated, and genes that were active can be silenced, and this change would be passed on to the daughter cells. However, it is inadvisable to use such drugs during sensitive periods of development. A sensitive period is a time during development that is the most sensitive to changes in the environment. The two sensitive periods of development are 1) germ cell development (primordial germ cells through to production of mature egg/sperm) and 2) early embryonic development (pre-implantation and early post-implantation). These sensitive periods are periods of active remodeling of the epigenome. During this time, epigenetic marks are being established. Any alteration in methylation patterns could disrupt normal development, causing disease or even death.</div>
