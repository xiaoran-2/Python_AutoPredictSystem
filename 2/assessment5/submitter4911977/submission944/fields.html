    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is the addition of a methyl group to the DNA at cytosines of the CpG islands catalyzed by the DNA methyl transferases know as DNMT3A and DNMT3B in a de novo fashion. DNMT1 has a preference for hemi-methylated DNA, that is one strand is methylated and the other is not. At every cell division this DNA methylation will be copied by DNMT1 onto the new daughter strands of DNA. 

CPG islands are where one find more CG di-nucleotides than you would expect by chance and they tend to be found at the 
promoters of gene's and it's where the transcription factors bind (normally they tend to be un-methylated, but in cancer cells certain gene's promoter region tend to be specifically methylated). DNA methylation is almost universally synonymous with silencing of gene expression and it is mitotic heritable. So, DNA methylation is an inactive epigenetic mark. DNA methylation at CpG islands found at particular times and with dynamic methylation between different cell types,such as inactive X chromosomes. 

Hypermethalation of CpG islands were observed some certain genes (silencing those tumor suppressor genes) in certain tumor cells.

DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements:

Normally, DNA methylation tend to be at intergenic intervals and their repetitive elements. The function of DNA methylation at intergenic regions is to maintain genomic integrity, not usually silencing the expression of a normal gene. 

In abnormal cells such as cancer cells that don't contain DNA methyl-transferase-one, the maintenance methyltransferase, then the cells, exhibit genomic instability (for example, deletions or insertions, as well as trans-locations between chromosomes). 

Epigenetic processes switch genes on and off by plastering either their DNA or the proteins which support that DNA in chromosomes with clusters of  methyl and acetyl groups. Epigenetic processes are susceptible to chemical intervention.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">You can also find hypomethylation of imprint control regions. The H19/Igf2 cluster, the imprint control region, it's methylated on the paternal allele, and it's unmethylated on the maternal allele. When it's unmethylated CTCF binds its insulator element, and it means that the enhancers in this case will act on H19. But Igf2 will be silent for the maternal allele, so we don't see expression. On the paternal allele, because this is methylated, now the enhancers can act on IGF2, because CTCF is not binding to inhibit this, and IGF2 is expressed from the pattern allele. 

However,  imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour, with loss of imprinting and there is hypermethylation of the imprint control region on the maternal allele as well. On the maternal allele, you also have expression of Igf2. So now you have a double dose of Igf2 in comparison to what you saw in a normal cell. And Igf2 is both growth promoting. Therefore, the cancer cells will grow like crazy because of the lost-control of igf2.

Research suggests that maybe these events at the imprint control regions, these hypermethylation, or hypomethylation (the less methylation) events. Might be very early events in tumorogenesis.

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">"DNA-demethylating agents, in the form of azacitidine, sold as Vidaza by Celgene, of Summit, New Jersey, and decitabine, sold as Dacogen by Eisai, a Japanese company, are used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia". 

Epigenetic mechanisms including DNA methylation, histone modification and remodeling, and non-coding RNA are interrelated and need to be stably maintained during cell divisions to conserve cellular identity. DNA methylation is the basis for different epigenetic phenomena such as imprinting, X chromosome inactivation or the formation of heterochromatin. 

Decitabine is a cytidine analog. Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent. Decitabine hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. A hypomethylating agent is a drug that inhibits DNA methylation. The term "demethylating agent" is also used. They are undergoing investigation for use in the treatment of tumors. 

Because of the epigenetic effects of the DNMT family, some DNMT inhibitors are under investigation for treatment of some cancers.

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Dr Stephen Baylin has shown that a combination of a histone-deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine slowed tumour growth in some people with advanced lung cancer.

The reason of altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome is because the epigenetic mark, in this case, the methylation of CpG islands, are  mitotic heritable, meaning they will go through mitosis with the marks preserved. Therefore, tumor cells with the methylation altered might lose their advantage of silencing the tumor suppressor gene expression, when they go through the standard chemotherapy, these tumor cells will be much more susceptible than the sibling tumor cells with intact un-altered epigenome.  

A sensitive period is a period of epigenetic reprogramming: the clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks. Sensitive periods of development are the periods of pre-implantation development and germ cell development.

Heritable epigenetic mechanisms provide the basis for differentiation, development and cellular homeostasis.Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because of it will interrupt the epigenetic reprogramming and have long last effect like passing to the next generation during the germ cell development, or lasting the whole life time if the treatment was applied during the pre-implantation development stage.
