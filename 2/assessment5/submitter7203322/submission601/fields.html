    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 locus loses its imprinting in Wilm’s tumour. The methylation status of the Imprint Control Region (ICR) of this locus controls the gene expression. Normally the H19 locus is expressed maternally and the Igf2 paternally. On the normal maternal allele, there is a binding site for the insulator protein, CTCF, upstream of the H19 locus and two enhancer sites. The enhancers preferentially bind at the Igf2 promoter, enhancing Igf2 expression. With the insulator CTCF bound, the enhancers switch to promoting H19 expression and Igf2 expression is repressed. On the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated, allowing CTCF binding. On the paternal allele, the ICR  is normally methylated. This prevents CTCF binding, allowing the enhancers to bind and promote the expression of Igf2 from the paternal allele. H19 is silenced on the paternal allele. In Wilm’s tumour, the maternal allele ICR is methylated, causing it to act like the paternal imprinted allele. Igf2 is then expressed at both alleles, H19 is silenced on both alleles,  resulting in Igf2 over-expression, which promotes cancer growth. Igf2 is involved in growth promotion, as are many of the genes which are imprinted. The loss of imprinting at this locus increases tumour growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs which alter the epigenetic marks in cancer cells can have long term effects due to the fact that DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. Any drug which affects DNA methylation therefore will have enduring effects on the epigenome. DNA methylation is reset in early embryogenesis and in primordial germ cell development. Imprinting marks are reset only in primordial germ cell development. Both of these periods are thus sensitive periods, where the use of epigenome altering drugs could have deleterious effects on the developing organism or its offspring. However, as we know from maternal behaviour effects on offspring’s hippocampal GR promotor methylation, there are other tissue and developmentally sensitive periods. Certainly, as oocytes at least are not matured until puberty, staying in a haploid demethylated state, childhood is another sensitive period. As epigenetic alteration due to drug treatment will affect all tissues, and not just the cancer that is targeted,  treatment in sensitive periods would result in aberrant DNA methylation patterns, affecting the organism, the developing fetus and the next generation through germ cell effects. </p>
<p>If possible, dependent on the state of the disease, cancer should not be treated with epigenetic altering drugs in pregnancy or in childhood.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally much of the genome is methylated, due to the methylation of the large intergenic and repetitive elements areas. Many of these areas contain transposons which can insert semi-randomly in the genome, activating adjacent genes through cryptic promoters (akin to the psuedoagouti mouse model). By keeping their DNA methylated and thus silenced, organisms keep their genome stable. In cancer, global hypomethylation is observed. These intergenic and repetitive element regions lose their methylation, leading to multiple insertion of repetitive elements across the genome, resulting in chromosomal aberrations and generalized genome instability.</p>
<p>Near genes, often in their promoters, areas with the dinucleotide CpG occur, called CpG islands. Normally, these CpG islands are unmethylated. In some tissues these will be methylated, in areas of heterochromatin, silencing certain genes and allowing tissue specific gene expression. In cancer, CpG islands that are normally not methylated are often methylated. This occurs  especially with tumour suppressor genes, which results in silencing these genes. CpG islands in poor promoters of certain genes, such as R-RAS in gastric cancer, can be hypomethylated in cancer, increasing their expression. Nearby areas to CpG islands, called CpG island shores, which are important in controlling gene expression through methylation in a tissue specific fashion, are also aberrantly methylated in cancer. The stem cell like nature of cancer cells seems to be due to DNA methylation of developmentally relevant genes, which are silenced in embryonic stem cells by histone modifications, not DBA methylation.</p>
<p> Decreased control of growth by tumour suppressors and increased growth promotion through signalling molecules such as RAS, and the changes in gene expression due to genomic instability,  leads to the characteristic uncontrolled growth of cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) is a cytidine analogue. It acts as a DNA methyl transferase inhibitor. This prevents fresh DNA methylation. With cell division, the DNA methylation is lost, resulting in hypomethylation of the genome. So it acts as a DNA demethylating agent. As cancer exhibits global  genome hypomethylation, but gene specific hypermethylation, it is likely decitabine’s major impact on cancer would be to reverse gene specific hypermethylation. Tumour suppressors, which are frequently silenced in cancer by DNA methylation, would become active and slow cell division and tumour growth.</p><p>
</p><p>As the DNA methylation status is mitotically heritable,  the reduction of methylation caused by Decitabine would be permanent. While decitabine would affect somatic cells as well as cancer cells, the cancer cells would be more dependent on the changes in the epigenome: cancer must grow, and that ability would be impaired by decitabine.</p></div>
