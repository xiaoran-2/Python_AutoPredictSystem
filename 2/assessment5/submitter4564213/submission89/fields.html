    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are found often at the promoters of genes, and their methylation is almost always associated with silencing of the genes. <br />CpG islands tend to be hypomethylated in normal cells and hypermethylated in cancer cells. The hypermethylation progresses with time and tumorigenicity. At the promoters of tumor suppressor genes, hypermethylation of the CpG islands silence the tumor suppressor genes and lead to cancerous growth.<br />Methylation at intergenic regions maintain genomic stability and prevent insertion/deletion/duplication events, as well as reciprocal translocations between chromosomes. Cryptic transcription sites or mRNA splice sites are also silenced by methylation at these regions. Methylation of repetitive elements likewise maintain chromosomal integrity, preventing illegitimate recombination. Activation and the resulting transposition/duplication/insertion of such elements throughout the genome, with subsequent disruptions to normal gene expressions, are suppressed by methylation. Strong promoters within these repeats are also silenced, preventing abnormal transcriptional interference.<br />Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are both hypermethylated in normal cells but hypomethylated in cancer cells. The hypomethylation progresses with time and tumorigenicity and leads to genomic instability, as well as aberrant behaviors of cryptic promoters and neighboring genes, including tumor suppressor genes. The overall effect is a loss of growth control and cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated, and the insulator protein CTCF is prevented from binding at the ICR region. A downstream enhancer protein can freely access and bind to the upstream Igf2 gene, leading to its normal expression.<br />In the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated, and CTCF binds at this ICR region. The insulator protein CTCF blocks the downstream enhancer protein's path to the upstream Igf2 gene, and Igf2 expression is silenced.<br />In Wilm's tumour, there is hypermethylation at the ICR region. The maternal allele becomes methylated like its paternal counterpart. Its normal imprinting is now altered, and it behaves similarly to the paternal allele. The result is a double dose of Igf2 expression. <br />Igf2 is a fetal growth factor , and its over-expression contributes to the cancerous growth in the childhood disease Wilm's tumor.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor. <br />A methyltransferase (like DNMT1) normally lays down DNA methylation during cell replication. Decitabine is a nucleoside analog that, when incorporated into a replicating DNA strand, irreversibly binds the methyltransferase and prevents it from carrying out further methylation activity. The depletion of the methyltransferases has the overall effect of demethylation of replicating cells. Since tumour cells divide more rapidly than normal cells, they are affected more. <br />In tumors like MDS, the CpG islands associated with the promoters of the tumor suppressor genes are heavily methylated. Their hypomethylation by Decitabine may explain the epigenetic part of the anti-tumour effect of this drug.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable, and any alterations in DNA methylation by epigenetic drugs are passed on to the daughter cells. The subsequent generations of daughter cells carry these changes throughout the lifetime of the individual, which accounts for the lasting effects of the epigenetic drugs beyond the treatment period.<br />A sensitive period in embryonic development is one during which extensive epigenetic reprogramming takes place. Existing epigenetic marks are erased and new marks are laid down. These sensitive periods occur during early embryonic development from pre-implantation through immediate post-implantation (zygote through blastocyst), and during primordial germ cells development through gametogenesis.  <br />The use of epigenetic drugs during these sensitive periods is inadvisable, as they would interfere with the normal functioning of the epigenetic machinery, resulting in aberrant and unpredictable changes to the embryo's or gametes' epigenome.</div>
