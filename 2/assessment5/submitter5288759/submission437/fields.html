    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">FDA approval on May 2, 2013 for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) was given to Decitabine, marketed as Dacogen.   Decitabine belongs to the class of epigenetic inhibitors known as DNA methylation inhibitors or DNA 'demethylating agents' and belongs to the chemotherapy category: anti-metabolites.  Decitabine has been shown to block the enzyme DNMT by binding irreversibly to it, blocking its function in the process of cell division.  As cancer cells are more rapidly dividing, the inhibition of DNMT by Decitabine has an anti-neoplastic effect.  The precise method of action of Decitabine is unknown, but it has been shown in clinical trials to be well tolerated and effective against MDS.  The long term effect of Decitabine on normal cells is unknown, but as a stand-alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents, its efficacy against MDS is remarkable.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic control in the mature organism, 
but aberrant forms are often associated with cancers.<br />CpG dinucleotides are clustered into CpG islands which tend to be protected from methylation.  DNA methylation at CpG islands is associated with gene silencing when found at gene promoters - this has been studied in great detail in relation to silencing of the X-chromosome.  Methylation of DNA  at CpG islands is mitotically heritable and is essential for viability of the embryo.  Looking at the genome as a whole, CpG islands are usually unmethylated whereas the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated.  <br />Methylation at Cytosine at CpG islands is mutagenic as the methylated Cytosine can be de-aminated to Thymine.  Within the intergenic regions and repetitive elements, DNA methylation helps maintain genomic integrity by silencing gene expression and interfering with transcriptional recombinations from transposable elements.  <br />The earliest epigenetic aberration observed in cancer was genome wide hypomethylation.  More recently, hypermethylation at CpG islands has been shown to silence some tumour suppressor genes. Thus the role of DNA methylation is context dependent; both hypo and hypermethylation of epigenetic controls are found in tumours.  Different tumours have different dependencies depending on the methylation variance.  When hypermethylation is found at the CpG islands of tumour supressor gene promoters, then inhibition of DNA methylation appears to suppress tumorigenesis by enhancing expression of the tumour supressor genes.  Contrariwise, when the tumour is driven by chromosomal instability, then depletion of DNA methylation in the repeats and interfenic regions enhances tumorigenesis by allowing oncogene expression and transcriptional recombination from the transposable elements of the repeats.  <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic control of gene expression has been shown in the case of imprint control regions (ICRs) to not necessarily correlate with silencing of gene expression, but with a much more sophisticated feedback and control mechanism,  An example is observed on human chromosome 11 with the ICRs associated with the H19/Igf2 and Kcnq1 clusters.   In normal cells, DNA methylation of the ICR on the paternal allele spreads to the H19 promoter and silences it - this allow activation of  Igf2 by downstream enhancers.  In contrast, on the maternal allele, where the ICR is not methylated H19 is expressed.  The unmethylated ICR on the maternal allele is insulated by the protein CTCF which blocks the downstream enhancers from activating Igf2.  Instead, a secondary transcription loop is favored by the downstream enhancers increasing the expression of H19.  In Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome, disruptions of the maternal allele cause it to act like the paternal allele because mutation/deletion causes loss of imprinting or two copies of the parental chromosome are inherited.  The subsequent up-regulation of Igf2 - a growth promoter, and loss of expression of Cdkn1c - a tumour suppressor, contributes to foetal and post-natal overgrowth and a predisposition to embryonic and childhood tumours such as Wilm's tumour.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal somatic tissue, the epigenetic control mechanisms are stable - there are mechanisms in place to insure the patterns of DNA methylation are  preserved during mitosis.  Aberrations to these normally stable mechanisms are also inheritable. If the averation results in the up-regulation of oncogenes or the down-regulation of tumour supressor genes, they may contribute to tumour-genesis.   Unlike genetic mutations, however, epigenetic changes are reversible.  <br />In the article quoted above, it was shown that use of a histone-deacetylase inhibitor with a standard chemotherapeutic agent was more effective in slowing growth of solid tumours.  In this first such use of an epigenetic anti-metabolite,  improved response to standard chemotherapeutic was noted after the trial.  It was speculated that the epigenetic agent altered the tumour cells in a way that was inherited.<br />Changes in DNA methylation occur at precise times during  early development and later during the generation of primordial germ cells.  These are sensitive periods of epigenetic reprogramming when the DNA methylation marks are cleared and reset in both the paternal and maternal genomes.  Use of drugs targeting epigenetic machinery would be ill advised during these sensitive periods as it would most likely result in embryonic death or sterility of the adult.<br /><br /><br /></div>
