    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are unmethyled in normal tissue and are mostly located in gene promoter site, so they have to be active (expressed). In cancer in CpG islands we observe hypermethylation, which blocks expression of cancer supressors. On the other hand in intergenic we observe reversed situation. Those regions are mostly metlylated in healthy tissue to maintain stability of the genome and prevent spointainous abberations. In cancer we observe hypomethylation <span>in intergenic regions and repetitive elements which leads to genome instability and changes like deletions or insertions.</span> </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In maternal normal genome H19 is unmethylated and block the enhancer and also act with CTCF and in next step they block the expression of Igf2. In paternal genome the situation is reversed and H19 is methylated which allow the enhacer to act on Igf2 and lead to its expression. This is example of monoallelic expression wich is performed only on paternal copy. In Wilm's tumor H19 is methylated also in maternal genome which lead to overexpression on Igf2 from both copies. This cluster is responsible for growth (growth factor), so overexpression leads to overgrowth wich is observed in cancer tissue.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is include into DNA-demethylating and hypomethylation agents group. Decitabine inhibits DNA methyltranferase. Protect from hypermathylation of intergenic regions. They can also probably act as demethylatransferase which with active way perform demethylation of DNA. So Decitabine can demethylate CpG islands gene promoters of tumor/cancer supressor. They can lead to maintain the protection role of cancer supressors.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Sensitive periods are those when in the genome we observe methylation remodelling. We can observe two main sensitive periods: early embronic development and primordial germ cells. Also after birth and some periods in adulthood can be sensitive but with lower intensivity. So established marks are maintaind in adulthood. The treatment in sensitive period could lead to many unpredictibla changes bucease this is very active process and once established methylation is mantain because is mitotically heritable.</div>
