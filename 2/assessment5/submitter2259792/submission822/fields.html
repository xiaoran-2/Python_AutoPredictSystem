    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, CpG islands of promoters are usually unmethylated whereas intergenic
regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated. In malignant tumours, gradual genome-wide DNA hypomethylation is
observed, concurrent with hypermethylation at normally unmethylated CpG
islands.</p>

<p>In cancer cells promoter, CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, and this can result in the blockage of the activity of tumour suppressor genes, that regulate cell division and growth.</p><p>In cancer cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to become hypomethylated, and
this hypomethylation has a consequence depending on where it's happening. Hypomethylation can result in illegitimate recombination between repeats. In a normal cell, this recombination wouldn't happen because the repeats would be heavily methylated and also they'd be heterochromatized. The repeats can be activated because of the hypomethylation. This means that the repeats have the capacity to make a copy of themselves and transpose, and this can result in consequent problems because they may disrupt the coding region of a gene and it also may activate neighboring genes. So, if
you have hypomethylation of repeats or intergenic regions, the consequence is
genomic instability. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the H19/Igf12 cluster, Igf12 is expressed only from the paternal allele. In the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated and it is bound by an insulator protein, CTCF. CTCF insulates Igf12 from enhancers, and these enhancers are free to act on H19 and enhance H19 maternal allele. In the paternal allele, ICR are methylated and it blocks CTCF binding. Without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to H!) promoter to silence, and enhancers can access Igf12 to activate. In Wilm's tumour, you have hypermethylation of the ICR on the maternal allele as well, and you also have expression of Igf12. You have a double dose of Igf12, that it's a growth promoting gene. One of the common features of cancer cells is they display loss of imprinting, so, genes that should be displaying monoallelic parent-of-origin-specific expression, they become either expressed from both parental alleles or silent from both parental alleles. So, you don't exclusively find hypermethylation of ICR in cancer, you can also find hypomethylation of ICR, and this depends on the particular ICR you're looking at and the function of the genes that are found within the control region.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. It is a nucleoside analog,so, it get incorporated into the DNA upon replication. When the DNA methyltransferase comes along to bind that nucleotid to then copy the methylation to the daughter strand, that DNA methyltransferase is bound irreversibly and it can no longer be released. This means that the action of these DNA methyltransferase inhibitors is division dependent. And so, the cancer cells which are dividing much more rapidly than most other cells in the body, will be more severily affected because they're replicating more.<br />Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, and by this process of demethylation, normal function to the tumour suppressor genes is restored, thus restoring control over cell growth.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment because epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Epigenetic modifications are stable and heritable, but are also reversible, and t<span>he
reversibility of epigenetic modifications renders them attractive targets for
therapeutic interventions. However, despite the fact that these marks are considered relatively stable during development, they must undergo reprogramming in primordial germ cell development and early embrionic development. So, this two rounds of reprogramming are sensitive periods. It is inadvisable treating patients during sensitive periods because during that periods (prenatal and early postnatal periods, childhood, puberty...) the epigenome and the mechanisms that routinely maintain proper epigenetic states, are particularly vulnerable to environmental exposures (such as drugs that inhibits the epigenetic machinery).</span><p></p></div>
