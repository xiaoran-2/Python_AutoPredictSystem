    <div class="field-value">In normal cells, CpG islands are usually hypomethylated. However, there are some CpG islands associated with gene silencing and they can undergo dynamic methylation depending on time and cell type.<br />Contrary, in tumor cells, CpG islands are very often hypermethylated. Moreover, these CpG islands can be found in promoters of tumor suppresor genes, it means that these promoters are blocked and tumor suppresor genes can not be expressed that can lead to progression of cancer. CpG methylation varies among cancer types and progresses with time, it means that it can be used as a new diagnostic and prognostic marker. <br />Concerning the intergenic regions and repetitive elements, they are usually methylated in normal  cells. The main function of this methylation is maintaining of genomic integrity. In case of intergenic regions, it is the prevention before deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations. This type of methylation can also silence cryptic promoters or a cryptic splice sites. In case of repetitive elements, it is prevention before transposition of these elements and it may also inhibits illegitimate recombination. Contrary, in cancer cells both intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be unmethylated and that leads to high genomic instability, because deletions, insertion or reciprocal translocations are possible and also duplication or loss of chromosomes is very common. Taking together, all these changes lead to high genomic instability and occurence or progression of cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In case of imprinted control regions, methylation is not connected with silencing or inactivation, because ICRs have different mechanisms of action. Concerning H19/Igf2 cluster, imprinted region is in the middle of the cluster and normally it is unmethylated on maternal allele and methylated on paternal allele, it means that this cluster is paternally imprinted. In case of maternal chromosome, imprinted region is unmethylated and can be bound by the protein CTCF, which is an insulator protein. It means that insulate enhancers from IGF2 and IGF2 is not expressed. In addition, enhancers can activate expression of lncRNA H19, which is reservoir of several miRNAs. Contrary, on paternal allele imprinted region is methylated and can not bind CTCF so enhancers can act on IGF2 expression. H19 is not expressed because the methylation of imprinted region spreds down to the promoter of H19. In case of Wilm's tumour, the patient looses maternal allele and has two paternal allele, it means that he has twice more IGF2, which is oncogene and promotes growth of the tumor. The loss of imprinting is hallmark of cancer and IGF2 overexpression contibutes to faster growth of many types of cancer. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine (also known as Dacogen) is sold by Japanese company Eisai and it belongs to DNA-demethylating agents, which are used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome. Decitabine interfers with the methylation of DNA that leads to lower methylation of DNA and activation of expression of tumour suppressor genes. These tumour suppressor genes can subsequently contribute to inhibition of tumour growth and can prevent the progression of the disease. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, alterations in DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome. It means that epigenetic changes can be passed on during cell division to daughter cells and these changes can also affect the response to subsequent anti-cancer therapy. The sensitive period is the period when epigenetic reprogramming occurs. The most sensitive periods of development are during early embryonic development and during germ cell development. Therefore, epigenetic drugs should be used primarily in older people after reproduction. In case of these people, we do not need to be aware of long-term side effects of this therapy so much, because the extension of lifespan and the quality of life are important. On the other hand, in case of younger patients and especially when they have developing germ cells we should be very careful because these drugs can affect all cells in the body and these germ cells are very sensitive to these drugs and to the changes in the epigenome. </div>
