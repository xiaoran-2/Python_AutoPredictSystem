    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The normal
function<b> </b>of DNA methylation at CpG
islands is silencing the gene expression, adding a methyl group to the DNA at
cytosines next to guanines causing gene inactivation. At cancer cells occurs a
hypermethylation of these CpG islands, it means there are more likely  DNA methylations of some specifics locus  than in normal cells, while in other DNA
intergenetic regions occurs the opposite process known as hypometylation. Hypermethylation
affects the CpG islands close to the promoter of genes related with tumor
suppressors. Also DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, so the new
characteristics of these cells due to this epimutation means an advantage
compared with normal cells favoring the proliferation of cancer.</span></p>

<p><span>The normal
function of DNA methylation on intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to
maintain de genomic stability avoiding recombination and translocations between
chromosomes. In cancer cells is really common the hypomethylation of these
intergenetic region and repetitive elements located mainly in heterochromatin
(package DNA). This hypometilation affects stability and integrity of the DNA sequence
and chromosomes. Due to the similarity in the sequence of the repetitive
elements and the exposure of heterochromatin the recombination and
translocation increases in the genome. Transposable elements replicate
themselves and activate some silencing oncogenic genes.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>At a normal
cell the imprinting of H19/Igf2 cluster is at the paternal allele because the
imprinted control region is methylated, so the CTCF can't bind and the Igf
allele is expressed because enhancers act on IGF2. The maternal allele has an
unmethylated control region where the CTCF can bind and silence the Igf2
maternal allele. When both alleles express Igf2 due to hypermethylation at
imprinted control region in maternal allele (causing the expression of
Igf2  maternal allele), the cells have an
overexpression of this gene that produces the Wilm’s tumour.  The hipomethylation or hypermethylation of the
imprinting control region at the H19/Igf2 cluster, may be the first step in
cancer development because loss of imprinting is a common characteristic in all
types of tumors</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine
is a drug that belongs to the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors group. This drug
causes the hypometilation of DNA decreasing the overactivity of the DNA
methyltransferase in cancer cells. When Decitabine is used in treat
myelodyplastic syndromes the hypometilation of DNA reactive silences genes,
like tumor suppressor genes, so cell growth could be controlled again. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Drugs that
alter DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because
changes in epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable, so if a drug could
eliminate hypermethylation from DNA  of
cancer cells, these changes could pass to new cells until them disappear
completely. However there are sensitive periods where occurs a reprograming or
resetting of these epigentic marks in 
the cells, allowing for example the cells differentiation and
pluripotence. These sensitive periods correspond to early development and
during developing germ cells. So treating patients during these sensitive
periods would not be advisable because the treatment could be affect all body’s
cell,  changing epigenetic marks
especially during the germ cell development in younger people and that might
affect the epigenetic and  health in
offspring.</span></p></div>
