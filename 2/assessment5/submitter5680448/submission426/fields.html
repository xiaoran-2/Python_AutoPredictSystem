    <div class="field-value"><p>In young normal cells, the DNA methylation pattern that assures normal cell growth is the hypomethylation of the CpG islands which are often involved in the activation of tumor suppressor genes. With cancer, these CpG islands become methylated with effect of inactivating the tumor suppressor genes and the cells are able to grown without the restraint of those genes. These CpG island hypermethylations may mimic the effect of genetic alteration of such genes as RB, MLH1, BRCA1 and MGMT.  In normal cells, the intergenic and repetitive elements are heavily methylated which promotes genomic stability.  With the progression of age and the development of cancer, these areas become hypomethylated which leads to </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprint control is important in regulating growth in developing cells and organisms. The paternal allele is methylated at the ICR and this suppresses the H19 gene so the normal enhancers do not work on the H19 gene but are able to stimulate the Igf2 locus and this stimulates cell growth.  In the normal maternal allele the ICR is not methylated and is protected by the CTCF and therefore the adjacent enhancers are able to stimulate the H19 gene and leave the Igf2 locus dormant. In Wilms tumor, the maternal allele ICR is not protected by CTCF, it is hypermethylated, the H19 cannot be expressed and the enhancers skip over the H19 site and stimulate the maternal Igf2 site.  Igf2 is a cell growth stimulator, which is now over expressed with both maternal and paternal alleles active and this leads to the cell growth stimulations which contributes to the development of cancer. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent.  It would remove methyl groups from the CpG islands which have become hyper methylated and have inactivated the tumor suppressor genes allowing unrestrained cell growth. By removing the methyl groups from the CpG islands the tumor suppressor genes are allowed to function normally and suppress the growth of the cells</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic alterations are heritable so cells that have a Epigenetic alteration will give rise to daughter cells that have that same alteration. Thus the effect of the drug which has produced that alteration will be seen in the daughter cells which were not themselves directly exposed to the drug.  Sensitive period is one during which Epigenetic reprogramming is occurring and the Epigenetic marks are being erased. These occur during early embryonic development and during primordial germ cell development which would occur during pregnancy. The effect of these drugs would be so wide spread that the total effect of the embryo would be unpredictable but also since the Epigenetic marks are erased during this time, the effect would not likely be lasting </div>
