    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell CpG islands tend to show hypomethylation as opposed to hypermethylation, and the intergenic regions, repetitive elements and introns are normally heavily methylated.  In fact in a normal cell the CpG islands are generally protected against hypermethylation.  When hypermethylation is seen at CpG islands its function is nearly always to silence gene expression.  The DNA methylation that is seen within the intergenic regions and repetitive elements in the normal cell in both cases seems to be involved in stabilizing the genome.  The methylation observed at intergenic regions appears to aid genomic stability by preventing genetic errors such as reciprocal translocations, insertions, duplications and deletions.  It is also thought to assist in the silencing of cryptic transcription start sites and cryptic splice sites.  The methylation observed in the repeat elements acts by silencing the repeats which if expressed could lead to transpositions that would lead to genetic mutations.  This methylation also helps to avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters which tend to cause expression of genes downstream from themselves, and it is thought that it may also help prevent illegitimate recombination.<br /><br />In cancer cells this normal pattern of hypo and hypermethylation appears to be reversed in almost all cases, with hypermethylation being observed at CpG islands and hypomethylation being seen in other regions such as the intergenic regions and within the repeat elements.  The hypermethylation that occurs in the CpG islands is normally involved in silencing tumour suppressor genes which prevent uncontrolled cell growth.  The hypomethylation that is seen in the intergenic regions and repeat elements in the cancer cell allows genes that were previously silenced to be expressed.  This can lead to genomic instability due to translocations, transcriptional interference, deletions, duplications and insertions that may cause mutations that cause or assist in the growth of the cancer.<br />                       </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprinted genes are those that show monoallelic parent of origin specific expression, meaning that only the gene from either the maternal or paternal lineage is expressed.  Hypermethylation of imprint control regions(ICR) is commonly observed in cancer and may be due to the fact that imprinted genes are often involved in growth (however hypomethylation may also be seen depending on the gene being looked at and its function).  This hypermethylation leads to loss of imprinting.  This can result in either silencing or expression from both parental alleles.   Hypermethylation of ICRs is a common early event in pre-neoplastic tissue.<br /><br />In the H19/Igf2 cluster the ICR on the maternal allele is unmethylated, this means that CTCF will bind to it and the enhancers will act on H19 but Igf2 will be silent.  On the paternal allele however the ICR in methylated so CTCF does not bind which allows the enhancers to act on Igf2 which is then expressed from the paternal allele.<br /><br />In Wilms tumour both the maternal and the paternal alleles are methylated (hypermethylation at ICR) causing Igf2 to be expressed from both alleles.  Igf2 is a growth promoting gene and the result of over-expression is Wilms tumour a childhood kidney tumour.  <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is an epigenetic drug that acts as a DNA demethylating agent and is used to treat Myelodysplastic syndrome.  It's in a class of drugs that act to inhibit DNA methyl transferases (DNMTs), these are nucleoside analogues that are incorporated into DNA when the cell replicates.  Once it is included in to the cells DNA, it binds to DNMTs irreversibly, preventing the DNMT from being released to carry on its methylating activity and thus it reduces DNA methylation.  As the action of the drug is replication dependent it can act effectively on cancer cells as they divide at a much higher rate than normal cells.  As specificity is not yet known it may also impact other replicating cells.<br /><br />In some cases DNA methylation appears to be involved in generating tumour cells and so by decreasing methylation it is possible to actually kill tumour cells and so have an anti-tumour effect.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Once changes have occurred to the epigenome they are passed on to daughter cells during cell division.  Passing on the altered epigenetic marks continues at each cell division until they are actively erased.  Therefore once DNA methylation is altered the effects of this will continue even after the drug has been discontinued.<br /><br />During several times in development there are sensitive periods when the cell is actively undergoing epigenetic reprogramming.  At these times the cell is more sensitive to external factors that may affect the epigenome.  Primordial germ cell development and pre-implantation and early development are 2 sensitive periods when there is major clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks.<br /><br />During sensitive periods it would be inadvisable to treat patients as treatment would inhibit the epigenetic machinery at a time that it is carrying out major reprogramming.  By inhibiting the epigenetic machinery this could have organism-wide effects.  Times when germ cells are developing should be avoided, also pregnancy when the embryo is undergoing epigenetic reprogramming in early development and during primordial germ cell development.  Inhibiting DNMTs at these times would not just affect methylation at cancer sites.  DNMT1 dropouts are shown to die mid gestation showing that DNMTs are vital during development.</div>
