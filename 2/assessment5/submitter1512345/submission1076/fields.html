    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Generally in case of normal cell the CpG
     islands are hypomethylated while cancerous cells shows focal
     hypermethylation in distinct subsets of promoter-associated CpG
     islands.The affected genes are permanently silenced, since methylation
     marks are propagated through mitosis and are maintained in the malignant
     clone.</li>
 <li>DNA methylation patterns undergo complex
     changes in cancer.The Epigenetic silencing by DNA methylation of
     cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors34-37, DNA repair genes38, apoptosis
     mediators39,40, nuclear receptors41-43, transcription factors44, cell
     adhesion molecules45, and many other genes has been reported in multiple
     cancer types46-49. </li>
 <li>The DNA methylation in intergenic regulates
     gene expression while repetetive region are normally methylated.</li>
 <li><span>The Hypomethylation of repeats and intergenic
     intervals leads to genome instabilty.</span></li>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>In most
tissues IGF2 is expressed from the paternal allele while H19 is expressed from
the maternal allele and in wilms tumors the maternal IGF2 imprint is relaxed
such that the gene is expressed biallelically. The relaxation of IGF2
imprinting in Wilms tumors also involved a concomitant reversal in the patterns
of DNA methylation of the maternally inherited IGF2 . The only specific
methylation changes that occurred in tumors with relaxation of IGF2 imprinting
were solely restricted to the maternal IGF2 genes. This shows that there has
been an acquisition of a paternal epigenotype in these tumors as the result of
a pathologic disruption in the normal imprinting of the IGF2 genes. Wilm's
tumor cells have shown loss of imprinting of the maternal chromosome and a
switch to the paternal pattern of methylation.<i> </i><i>H19</i> mRNA expression
was decreased at least twentyfold in most Wilms' tumors, indicating that <i>H19</i> is
inactivated in tumor cells. This
results in the overexpression of <i>IGF2</i>and reduced expression
of <i>H19</i>. Because <i>H19</i> functions to
slow cell growth and <i>IGF2</i> stimulates cell growth,
loss of imprinting at the <i>H19</i>/<i>IGF2</i> locus results in
uncontrolled cell growth that can lead to tumor formation</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a </span><u>hypomethylating
agent</u> It
hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting <u>DNA
Methyltransferase </u> indicated
for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). It functions in a
similar manner to <u>azacitidine</u>, although decitabine can only be incorporated
into DNA strands while azacitidine can be incorporated into both DNA and RNA
chains.The synergy of vorinostat and decitabine in killing mantle cell lymphoma
cells is one example of an effective epigenetic combination in a B-cell
malignancy. Decitabine induces very early in vivo DNA methylation
changes. Genes involved in all aspects of tumor development and growth can
become aberrantly methylated in tumor cells, including genes involved in
apoptosis and cell cycle regulation. D<span>emethylating
agents (Decitabine) have been used to reactivate tumor suppressor genes
aberrantly methylated in tumor cells, leading to inhibition of tumor growth.</span><a></a></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA
methylation plays an important role in gene regulation in normal cells.
However, DNA hypermethylation may leads to transform the normal cells into
cancerous cells. sensitive period is a period during which active epigenetic
reprogramming takes place during development. These epigenetic
reprogramming occurs during Primodial germ cell development in early embroyonic
development i.e. during Morula and Blastula stage. these may leads to maintain
the imprinted genes imprinting. during active reprogramming old DNA
methylations are removed and new tissue specific epigenetic marks are
re-established. however drugs may interfere the embroyonic development if they
are administered to the patients during sensitive period and may leads to
severe abnormalities like loss of imprinting, disease and even death.</span><a></a></p></div>
