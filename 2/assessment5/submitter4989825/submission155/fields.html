    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The imprint control region of the paternal allele is methylated,transcriptional suppressor CTCF does not bind it's insulator element to inhibit so enhancers act on Igf2 and it <strong>is</strong> expressed. The imprint control region of the maternal allele is not methylated, CTCF binds it's insulator element so enhancers act on H19 rather than Igf2 so Igf2 <strong>is not</strong> expressed. Imprinting of the maternal allele is disrupted in Wilm's tumour. The maternal allele becomes methylated and so expresses Igf2. This causes the maternal allele to behave the same as the paternal allele. The two alleles produce a double dose of Igf2 compared to a normal cell.This double dose of Igf2 (growth promoting) contributes to proliferation of these cells causing the tumour.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor class of epigenetic inhibitors.It is currently used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes. The drug is a nucleoside analogue which is incorporated into the DNA during replication.This incorporation inhibits DNA methyltransferase thereby causing demethylation of that sequence. The Decitabine is irreversibly bound to the DNA methyltransferase after incorporation which results in hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis.This interferes with the growth of a tumour. The effects are dependent on cellular replication so cancer cells which are dividing rapidly are affected more than normal cells.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"> DNA methylation does not normally occur at CpG islands except when it is associated with X-chromosome inactivation and imprinting. In those cases DNA methylation at CpG islands is responsible for silencing the expression of the gene. In cancer CpG islands and island shores become hyper-methylated. DNA hyper-methylation of CpG islands near the promoter of a tumour suppressor gene silences that gene.Loss of function of tumour suppressor genes allows inappropriate growth promotion.This provides one of the hits in the Knudson two hit model. It is mitotically heritable, therefore very effective and selected for cancer cell epimutation.<br /> Intergenic regions and repetitive elements constitute most of the genome. These areas are normally hyper-methylated producing tightly compacted chromatin which silences transcription and is believed to maintain genomic integrity . In cancer the intergenic regions and repetitive elements become hypo-methylated. Hypo-methylation in intergenic regions can lead to deletions, insertions, and translocations between chromosomes. It can also remove silencing from cryptic promoters or cryptic splice sites which results in transcriptional interference. Repetitive elements copy themselves and place the copies elsewhere in the genome.This is mutagenic as it allows transcription of neighbouring genes when not appropriate. Hypo-methylation of repetitive elements makes them accessible to illegitimate recombination which is also mutagenic. The hypo-methylation of these areas is thought to lead to the genomic instability found in cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have lasting effects because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, therefore altered methylation will be passed on from daughter cell to daughter cell. This applies to all sorts of cells including tumour cells.<br />A sensitive period is defined as a period when the environment may be able to influence the epigenetic make-up. The two main sensitive epigenetic periods are during primordial germ cell development and pre-implantation/early post-implantation. These are periods of active remodeling of the epigenome. There are also brief periods of time where a particular organ has a sensitive period because of how that organ develops.<br />Treating patients with epigenetic drugs during sensitive periods can lead to irreversible changes to the epigenome. Changes during gametogenesis can be inherited by offspring.<br /><br /><br /></div>
