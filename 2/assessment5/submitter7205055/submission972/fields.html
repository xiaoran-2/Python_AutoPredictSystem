    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation usually silence the genes. In normal cells CpG islands in promoter region of DNA are unmethylated while they are hypermethylated in case of cancer. This disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands either repress the tumor suppressor genes or express the oncogenes and hence contributes to cancer. Unlike CpG islands, intergenic regions as well as repetitive elements are methylated in normal cells but are unmethylated in cancer. As the effect of methylation on intergenic regions and repetitive elements represents the genome-wide or global DNA methylation status, the disruption of DNA methylation either suppresses or expresses of genes related to cancer, which is context dependent. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Hypo or hypermethylation of DNA at imprint control regions can result in repression of growth restricting genes or in expression of growth promoting genes. For example, H19/Igf2 has differential expression of insulin dependent growth factor 2 (Igf2) because of the hypermethylation in its imprint control region (ICR). In normal cells, the paternal allele of Igf2 is methylated in its ICR, hence resulting no interaction with binding protetin (CTCF), promoting the gene expression of Igf2. On the other hand, maternal allele is unmethylated in its ICR, hence resulting into interaction with CTCF, expressing H19 instead of Igf2. In case of Wilm's tumor, both maternal and paternal allele are methylated in their ICRs and therefore causing overexpression of Igf2. As there is overexpression of growth factor, the cancer cells tend to grow well.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is one of the FDA approved drugs that acts as DNA demethylating agent and inhibit DNA methyltrasferase (DNMT) enzyme responsible of DNA methylation. As DNMT inhibitors are nucleoside analogues, they can irreversibly bind to DNMTs, preventing hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes. Since, hematological malignancies such as Myelodysplastic syndrome are dependent on tumor suppressor genes,Decitabine can have an anti-tumor effect.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">As the epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable to daughter or grand daughter cells until actively erased, some drugs targeting DNA methylation may have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment. Sensitive period is regarded as the time for epigenetic reprogramming when these epigentic changes are erased. There are two sensitive periods: one in pre-implantation period during early gestation, and the other in mid-gestation period when the primordial germ cells develop.Hence, treating with pateints during these sensitive periods is not advisable. This is simply because we don't want to supply any epigenetic markers which potentially interferes epigenetic reprogramming during the sensitive periods.</div>
