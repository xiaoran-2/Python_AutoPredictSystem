    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p><span>In normal cells CpG islands
are usually hypomethylated, and intergenic regions and repeat elements
hypermethylated. In cancer cells CpG islands are hypermethylated, especially in
tumor suppressor genes, and intergenic and repeat elements are hypomethylated.
Hypermethylation of the CpG islands leads to silencing of the gene, which in
the case of tumor suppressors increases the likelihood of over proliferation
and cancer. Methylation of intergenic and repeat elements leads to their
silencing and protects the genome from instability. i.e. mutations and
chromosomal aberrations. Hypomethylation of these regions leaves the DNA more
loosely packaged and available to transcription, which increases for example the
likelihood of illegitimate recombination between repeats in different
chromosomes. It also leads to activation of transposons and cryptic promoters,
which can lead to activation of cancer genes or silencing of tumor suppressor
genes.  </span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer, loss of imprinting,
either silencing or expression of both parental alleles when only one should be
expressed, seems to happen. For example, in the imprint control region (ICR) of
the H19/Igf2 cluster, the ICR is usually methylated in the paternal allele,
which then blocks the binding of CTCF and allows the access of downstream
enhancers to Igf2 and its expression. In the maternal allele the ICR is
unmethylated, allowing CTCF to bind, insulating the enhancers from Igf2 and
leading them to promote H19 expression instead. Therefore, in normal cells Igf2
is expressed only from the paternal allele. In Wilm’s tumor, the ICR is
methylated also on the maternal allele, leading to a double dose of Igf2
expression, which is a growth promoter, and excess amount of growth promoters
leads to over proliferation of the cells and cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyl
transferase inhibitor (DNMTi). It causes DNA demethylation by acting as a
nucleoside analogue which binds DNMT permanently and keeps it from performing
its function. Since it’s a nucleoside analogue, it targets dividing cells
(which cancer cells are), and works in cancers where the problem is
hypermethylation.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Since epigenetic
changes are mitotically heritable, the daughter cells of those cells that have
been treated with drugs targeting DNA methylation will also retain the epigenetic
changes. Because of this, they shouldn’t be used in patients during sensitive
periods, in other words during periods of epigenetic reprogramming, such as primordial
germ cell development and early development of a fetus. Therefore children /
young people at the age of primordial germ cell development and pregnant women
shouldn’t be treated with epigenetic inhibitors. </p>
