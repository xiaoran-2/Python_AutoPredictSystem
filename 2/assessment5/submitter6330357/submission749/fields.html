    <div class="field-value"><p></p><ul><li> DNA methylation, adding a methyl group to the adenine or cytosine
DNA nucleotides, is associated with a number of key processes including
genomic <b><i>imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, suppression of
repetitive elements, and carcinogenesis</i></b>. DNA methylation is one of
several epigenetic mechanisms that cells use to control gene expression. Epigenetic
alterations are as important as genetic mutations in a cell’s transformation to
cancer. Based on Knudson hypothesis <u>cancer is the result of multiple hits to
DNA and DNA methylation can be one of those hits</u>.</li><li>Hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes and hypomethylation of
oncogenes has been implicated in the development and progression of cancer. H<i>ypermethylation
typically occurs at <b>CpG islands in the promoter region</b></i> and
is associated with <b>gene inactivation</b>. </li><li>CpG island methylation plays an important role in epigenetic
gene control during mammalian development and is frequently altered in disease
situations such as cancer. </li><li>In tumour cells, repeat-rich heterochromatin becomes hypomethylated
and this contributes to genomic instability. <b><i>De novo</i></b> methylation
of CpG islands also occurs in cancer cells, and can result in the
transcriptional silencing of growth-regulatory genes. </li><li>In cancer, global genomic hypomethylation, leading to genomic
instability and oncogene activation, affects r<b>epetitive sequences</b>, imprinted
genes( <b>ICRs</b>), tissue-specific genes, oncogenes, and genes associated with invasion and
metastases, whereas many tumor suppressor genes are hypermethylated and
silenced.<span>Epigenetic
hallmarks of cancer include <b>global DNA hypomethylation</b> and l<b>ocus-specific
hypermethylation of CpG islands</b> (CGIs).It looks </span>CpG islands are genomic footprints of promoters and that their methylation contributes to stable long-term silencing of the associated genes. </li><li><p><span>In <u>normal cells</u>, <b>CpG
islands preceding gene promotors</b> are generally <b>unmethylated</b>, while <b>other
individual CpG dinucleotides</b> throughout the genome tend to be <b>methylated</b>.
However, <u>in cancer cells</u>, CpG islands preceding tumor suppressor gene
promoters are often hypermethylated, while CpG methylation of oncogene promoter
regions and parasitic repeat sequences is often decreased.</span></p></li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>  </span><span>Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon by which certain
genes can be expressed in a parent-of-origin-specific manner. In human,
imprinted alleles are silenced such that the genes are either expressed only
from the non-imprinted allele inherited from the <b><i>mother (e.g. H19),</i></b>
or in other instances from the non-imprinted allele inherited from the <b><i>father</i></b>
<b><i>(e.g. IGF-2).</i></b> One of the common features of cancer cells is they
display loss of imprinting and genes that should be imprinted, no longer show
this imprint of expression but rather they become either expressed from both
parental alleles and silent from both parental alleles.</span></p>

<p><span>  </span><span>The ICR of the IGF2 H19 cluster is methylated on the paternal
allele. When it's unmethylated <b><i>CTCF binds its
insulator element</i></b>, and the enhancers will act on H19. But Igf2 will be
silent for the maternal allele, so we don't see expression. On the paternal
allele, because ICR is methylated, IGF2 is expressed from the pattern allele. </span></p>

<p><span> </span><span>With loss of imprinting there is <b><i>hypermethylation of the
imprint control region on the maternal allele</i></b> and <b><i>expression of
Igf2</i></b>. So now you have a double dose of Igf2 and Igf2 is both growth
promoting, and this is associated with Wilm's tumour. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA
methylation are known to contribute to the malignant transformation of cells by
silencing critical genes. M<span>ethylation of
DNA is a major mechanism that regulates gene expression in cells.  When there is an increase in DNA methylation
this can result in the blockage of the activity of "suppressor genes"
that regulate cell division and growth. 
When suppressor genes are blocked, cell division becomes unregulated,
allowing or promoting cancer.</span> Drugs that
inhibit DNA methyltransferases were shown to have the potential to reactivate
silenced genes and induce differentiation or apoptosis of malignant cells.</p>

<p><span>DNA-demethylating decitabine (trade
name Dacogen), or 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, is a member of a new class of drugs
known as <b><i>DNA "demethylating" agents</i></b>.  It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA
methyltransferase. By this process of demethylation, normal function to the
tumor suppressor genes is restored, thus restoring control over cell growth. Decitabine
also belongs to the category of chemotherapy called <strong>antimetabolites</strong>.  </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Stephen Baylin et al have shown that a combination
of a <b>histone-deacetylase inhibitor</b> and DNA-demethylating agents (azacitidine)
slowed tumour growth in some people with advanced lung cancer. participants who
did not show much response to the trial showed an unexpectedly <b>good reaction
to the routine chemotherapeutic drugs</b> which were employed on them next. Dr
Baylin speculates that his epigenetic drugs altered the tumour cells in some
lasting way that made them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy. </span></p>

<p><span>Unlike other forms of gene regulation (those
involving transcription factors, for example), <i>epigenetic changes are passed
on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are
actively erased</i>. Once erased, though, they do not return. It might therefore
be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which <b><i>stop a cancer
growing without having to kill all its cells</i></b>.</span></p>

<p><span>Because azacitidine is a DNA-demethylating agent, we
should avoid using this drug during <b><i>sensitive period when epigenetic
machinery is active</i></b>. For example during egg or sperm formation when
through addition of methyl groups to DNA a copy of inherited genes becomes epigenetically
silenced. In <b><i>younger patients</i></b> and <b><i>pregnant women</i></b> in
the <b>early stage</b> of pregnancy should be used by caution.</span></p></div>
