    <div class="field-value"><strong>CpG islands:-</strong><br />In <b>normal cells mostly CpG islands are unmethylated.</b> But when <b>CpG islands</b> undergo <b>methylation</b> by DNMT3a/3b it <b>leads to silencing of the particular gene expression</b> as CpGs are clustered into islands at the promoters of genes. The specific feature of the CpG island methylation is that it is symmetrical and mitotically heritable.<br />In <b>cancer cells, CpG islands are methylated where</b> as <strong>intergenic regions, repetitive elements are unmethylated</strong>  as compared to normal cells.<br />Considering the mechanism of hypermethylation of CpGs in cancer cells it has been found that, usually <strong>the promoters of tumor suppressor are silenced by CpG hypermethylations rather than the mutations. </strong>As the tumor suppressors are silenced there is no normal tumor suppressor activity in the cells.<br />The of CpGs methylated in set of genes found in variety of cancer types is called as the <strong>CpG methylator phenotype</strong> <strong>CIMP, </strong>which is used as <strong>an identification marker </strong>for a particular type of cancer<strong>. Ex. Colorectal cancer.<br /><br />Intergenic regions &amp; repetitive elements:-<br /></strong>Normally they are <strong>methylated and kept silenced.</strong> This is essential to avoid the functionality of the repetitive element. <br />It is known that <strong>repetitive elements</strong> are the sites which lead to <strong>increased chromosomal aberrations</strong> such as recombination leading to translocations, inversions, deletions etc. Thus normally these sites are silenced by methylation.<br />In <strong>cancer cells these methylations are disrupted</strong> and these site become functional which leads to <strong>chromosomal instability which is the hallmark of many cancer types.</strong><br />Considering the <strong>mechanism</strong> it is known about the <strong>hypomethylation of such intergenic regions and repetitive elements leads to genomic instability by increasing illegitimate recombination, transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighboring genes. </strong>Ex. Avy &amp; Axin alleles<br />Even it is suggested that <strong>CpG poor promoters when hypomethylated may lead to activations of oncogenes</strong>. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><strong>Methylation at Paternal ICR:</strong><br />Paternal <strong>ICR is methylated</strong> hence, insulator <strong>CTCF can not bind</strong> there. Due to this the <strong>enhancers</strong> downstream <strong>activate </strong><em><strong>Igf2</strong></em><strong> expression</strong> instead of <em>H19. Thus <strong>Igf2 active, H19 silenced.</strong></em><br /><strong><br />Unmethylation at Maternal ICR:</strong><br />Unmethylated ICR on maternal chromosome leads to binding of CTCF thus the enhancers can act on H19 to activate its expression. Igf2 is not expressed. Thus <em><strong>Igf2 silenced, H19 active.<br /></strong></em><strong></strong><strong><br />Wilm's tumor:- <br /></strong>In Wilm's tumor, the normal methylation pattern is disrupted and both, i.e. <strong>maternal and paternal ICR's are methylated.  </strong>This is an example of hypermethylation of ICR leading to over expression of growth promoting genes.<br /><em><strong><br /></strong></em><strong>Contribution to cancer:<br /></strong>As both ICR's are methylated CTCF is not able to bind at the locus, hence the <strong>enhancers activate only the expression of <em>Igf2, </em></strong>and <em><strong>H19 </strong></em><strong>remains unexpressed.<br /></strong>As both the chromosomes (maternal and paternal) express <em>Igf2</em>, (i.e. double the amount than usually expressed due to imprinting) it contributes to cancer. Igf2 being growth promoting gene, it over expression leads to cancer development.<em><strong><br /><br /></strong></em><em></em></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to class of <strong>the DNA demethylating drugs/agents</strong>.<br /><br />As suggested in the article, decitabine will lead <strong>to DNA demethylation, possibly through inhibiting the action of DNMT (DNA methyl transferases).</strong> <br /><br /><strong>Anti tumor effect:</strong><br />One of the particular epigenetic modification observed in <strong>cancers is hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes</strong>. So in this case an <strong>inhibitor of DNMT</strong> or a drug which will directly demethylate DNA <strong>will lead to demethylation of DNA</strong>. Thus the <strong>tumor suppressor gene can again be expressed and hence it will have anti tumor effect.</strong><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><strong>Effects of altering DNA methylation:</strong><br />-Will affect activation/silencing of the gene creating an imbalance<br />-Will lead to loss of imprinting or eventually misimprinting.<br />- This may result in either overexpression of genes due to hypomethylation or complete silencing due to hypermethylation!!!<br /><br /><strong>Sensitive period:</strong><br />The period in which <strong>epigenetic reprogramming occurs</strong>. These periods are considered to be sensitive as any alteration in this will have serious consequences later on for the next generations.<br /><br /><strong>Two sensitive periods:</strong><br />1. <strong>Early embryonic development</strong>: from fertilization of gametes till epiblast formation<br />2.<strong>Primordial germ cell development</strong>: differential reprogramming in spermatogenesis Vs oogenesis.<br /><br /><strong>Treatment during the sensitive periods:</strong><br />Treatment during these periods is inadvisable as during these periods as:<br />1. It will affect the methylation pattern of maternal as well as paternal genome<br />2. It will affect status of imprinted genes which are differentially reprogrammed than other genes<br />3. It will affect the constitutive hypermethylated status of repetitive elements (thus affecting genomic stability, increasing illegitimate recombinations.<br /><br />Thus sensitive periods should be avoided for drug treatments leading to epigenetic alterations! </div>
