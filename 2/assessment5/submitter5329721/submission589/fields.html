    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA (hyper)methylation at CpG islands/CpG island shores (CGI) generally functions to silence gene expression. Normally in non-cancerous cells, the CpG Islands are hypomethylated at the promotors of genes but hypermethylated at the introns of genes, at the repetitive elements, and at the intergenic regions. However, in cancerous cells the DNA methylation of CpGs is disrupted both locus-specifically and globally.  </p><p>In cancer, there is locus-specific hypermethylation of promoters, ICRs, and of CpG islands and CGIs (often but not limited to) sets of tumors suppressor genes (TSG). Simultaneously, there is an overall decrease in global CpG island methylation (hypomethylation) at the CpG-poor promoters, the ICRs, the repetitive elements and at the intergenic regions.<br /></p><p>A simple change from hyper- to hypomethylation of CpG-poor promoters will more likely activate previously silenced genes, for instance oncogenes (gene that promotes cancer). Similarly the hypermethylation of normally hypomethylated CpG/CGI of TSGs will likely silence the genes that suppress tumor growth and thus contribute to cancer. The change in methylation patterns of ICR might result in abnormalities in how those imprinted genes are expressed; the ICR might loose imprinting, i.e. these  genes will either get expressed or silenced from both of the alleles. This might cause tumors if, for instance, a growth promoter gene is overexpressed or if a growth restricting gene is silenced. <br /></p><p>Genomic instability might also contribute to cancer and it might also arise due to altered DNA methylation of CpGs of repetitive elements and intergenic regions. The CpGs at the intergenic regions and at the repetitive elements are normally hypermethylated to maintain genomic stability. In cancer, however, they are hypomethylated making them likely to cause genomic instability by allowing for illegitimate recombination between the repeats (causing insertions, deletions, translocations, etc), or by activating repeats/transposition, or allowing for transcription of cryptic promoters disrupting adjacent genes, etc..</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Abnormal overgrowth is one of cancer’s hallmarks. Most imprinting genes are involved in either promoting/restricting cellular growth, therefore disruption of imprinting could contribute to cancer. One such example of imprinting disruption contributing to cancer involves the Igf2 gene.</p><p>Igf2 is a growth-promoting gene expressed from the H19/Igf2 cluster. In this case, the DNA-methylation imprint normally lies on the paternal allele. In a methylated state, the ICR prevents the binding of the insulator CTCF. In the absence of CTCF, the DNA-methylation spreads to the H19-promoter silencing its expression. This allows the enhancers to access the Igf2-promoter and subsequently Igf2 is expressed. In contrast, the maternal H19/lgf2 is normally unmethylated.  Therefore the ICR is bound by CTCF, blocking the enhancer's access to the Igf2-promoter, i.e. Igf2 is not expressed.<br /></p><p>Changes in the methylation of ICR of imprinted genes might cause them to lose their imprinting, i.e. the genes on both alleles will either get expressed or silenced. In Wilm's tumor the maternal H19/lgf2 cluster also gets methylated. This imprinting disorder causes the maternal allele to function like the paternal allele. Consequently, there is an expression of Igf2 from both alleles; an overexpression which in turn leads to tumorous growth and cancer.<br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an epigenetic inhibitor, belonging to a class of DNA-methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi). Decitabine functions as a nucleoside analog that gets incorporated into the replicating DNA. Prior to cell division, DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) binds to the newly-synthesized daughter strands in order to add methyl-groups at the specific CpGs. As the DNMT binds to Decitabine it gets irreversibly disabled from performing its methyltransferase activity. This leads to DNA-replication dependent demethylation of the DNA CpGs. In terms of cancer treatment, Decitabine can have an anti-tumor effect since it can lead to the demethylation of CpG islands on tumor suppressor genes (TSG), changing them from a ‘silenced’ to an ‘active’ expression state. As TSGs are expressed, they should inhibit tumorous growth. </p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>ref for q1-4: course content, recommended/required/extension reading, course notes and lectures. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation might indeed have effect(s) that lasts beyond drug treatment simply because DNA methylation is a mitotically inheritable epigenetic mark, i.e. the changes induced in the CpG methylation of the genome is passed down to the daughter cells during mitosis. </p><p>The epigenome regulates the cellular development, differentiation, homeostasis in an organism. In using epigenetic drugs it is important to note that the epigenetic drugs currently in use are not targeted but work throughout the system (affecting the entire body). More pronounced consequences are especially more likely to occur if the DNA methylation is altered during epigenetically sensitive periods. Sensitive periods in context of epigenetics are periods in which epigenetic marks are being established, i.e. are removed and then reset. These sensitive periods occur during the early embryonic development and during germ cell development (there are also organ specific sensitive periods as well). It would therefore be inadvisable to treat a patient with epigenetic altering drugs at an epigenetically sensitive period since any alteration could have a more impacting effect on the epigenome; some imprinting might be permanently lost in the germ cells? developmental cascade events could be effected in the germ cells? etc.<br /></p></div>
