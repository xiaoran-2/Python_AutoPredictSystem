    <h1>Submission 293 from Anon (session_user_id: ddc4adcd88a5bb1584eada3088531742111ec5aa)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. Is uses to treat cancer because have a inhibitor effect of DNA methyltranferases (DNMT1) resulting in genomic hypomethylation allowing the reactivation of tumour suppressor genes. The anti-tomour effect of the Decitabina is due the reactivation of these tumour suppressor genes that help for the reducing the proliferation of tomour cells because their job major is to stop the uncontrolled cell growth that causes cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The aim of drug therapy is to reprogram epigenetic chemical changes that affect the methylation of DNA, which activates and deactivates genes of cancer cells.<br />This reprogramming may alter the activity of key genes in cancer cells that control their growth and survival. After using these DNA demethylating drugs was observed a decreased DNA methylation and reactivation of tumor suppressor genes that affect the growth of tumor cells. These changes may be present a period beyond drug treatment received because epigenetic changes are transmitted during cell division generating a memory as an antitumor response.<br />The treatment of patients with these drugs during a sensitive period (critical period of development in which the genetic reprogramming where cells acquire a certain biological memory to handle external influences ) is not advisable as it may lead to persistent effects or standing on the structure or function of the organism.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The disruption of imprinting involves altering imprinting marks through an increase or decrease of the degree of methylation of DNA.<br />When is lost imprinting of a promoter growth gene the activation of a normally silenced allele is induced resulting in an abnormally high expression of proteins that contribute to cancer. The disruption of imprinting of Igf2 is the most common between different tumor types. Igf2 an autocrine growth factor and H19 a protein with growth suppressive properties.<br />Under normal conditions the Igf2 and H19 proteins are expressed from maternal and paternal alleles. The paternal allele is methylated and regulates the expression of H19 and Igf2.<br />In a typical organization the H19 ICR is methylated exclusively on the paternal allele. This allows expression paternal of Igf2 and the expression maternal of H19, such that methylation maternal allele enhanced expression of Igf2 and decresed expression H19 of the same allele. <br />For example, Wilms' tumor (kidney) the ICR region is hypermethylated in the maternal allele which inhibits binding of CTCF and thus enables access of enhancers H19 to promoter Igf2 in both alleles causing overexpression of Igf2.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is the addition of a single methyl (CH3-) group to cytosine at position 5. The majority of CpG sites in human DNA are methylated. This methylation is a silencing epigenetic marks. In mammals DNA methylation is established and maintained by DMNT1 (DNA methyltranferase) and is required for proper embryogenesis and development, for sustaining chromosomal stability, telomere length, and predetermined gene expression states .<br />CpG islands are usually unmethylated in normal cells, except the regulatory CpG islands that are hypomethylated. In contrast the disruption of DNA methylation in cancer cells show an overall hypomethylation and hypermethylation of CpG islands. This change in the DNA methylation pattern usually results in the inappropriate silencing of certain genes, especially in the tumor suppressor, which induces the development of various cancers.<br />DNA methylation patterns undergo complex changes in cancer. The total amount of methylated cytosine is usually decreased resulting in global hypomethylation. Decreased cytosine methylation typically affects satellite DNA, repetitive sequences, and CpG sites.<br />In normal conditions the Human repetitive elements (REs) are generally highly methylated and this status is associated with maintenance of chromosome structure and genome integrity. However when the disruption of DNA methylation in repetitive elements occurs the hypomethylation of highly repeated DNA sequences is largely responsible for the global DNA hypomethylation that is observed so frequently in cancers.<br /></div>
