    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value">In general terms, DNA methylation of promoter regions inversely correlates with gene expression, higher methylation, less expression. But CpG islands, which are found in about 60% of promoters, have a high CpG islands density and are usually kept no methylated with no relation with their activity state. In cancer cells CpG islands are hypermethylated, this causes silencing gene expression. The hypermethylation in CpG islands can cause silencing of tumor suppressor genes  
(controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair ). DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements forms the pattern of gene expression in cells.  Intragenic methylation is found at repetitive sequences. Changes in DNA methylationin cancer include a genome-wide loss and a regional gain of DNA methylation. A directed hypomethylation at satellite repeats could be detected in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contribute to cancer by instability and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In most tissues Igf2 is expressed from the paternal allele, this means that the maternal allele is imprinted with high methylation pattern and paternal allele is hipomethylated (no imprint) to allow expression. In Wilm´s tumour the maternal Igf2 imprint is lower and therefore the gene is expressed in both alleles. This also implieschanges in
the patterns of DNA methylation of the maternally inherited 19 allele. The specific
methylation changes that occurred
in tumours with lowering of Igf2 imprinting are restricted to the
maternal IGF2 and H19 alleles. Studies suggest that there has been an acquisition of a paternal
epigenotype in these tumours.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, it removes methylation in tumour cells. It is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. The anti-tumour effect is due to the demethylation in tumour cells. These modified cells are more susceptible to standard chemotherapy than untreated tumour cells.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment becuase they modify the imprint pattern. They alter DNA methylation and this keeps "stable" in the epigenome. Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and 
granddaughter cells until they are actively erased but once erased they do not return.A sensitive period is a period of time in the development which is very sensitive to epigenetics changes and when the epigenome is re-programmed (DNA methylation is re-established). Sensitive periods occur on early stages of development in the utero. At this stage would be inadvisable trating patients with these kind of drugs because all cells are epigenetically re-programing and all cells would be sensitive to DNA methylation removal not only tumoral cells. Due to this fact, all imprinting marks would be permanently altered with probably serious unknown effects in future development.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
