    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are found in about 60% of promotors. In normal cells CGIs in general are unmethylated however in cancer cells they are usually methylated. This methylation of CpG islands leads to the tumour suppressor genes silensing (and other underlying genes). On the other hand intergenic regions and repetetive elements in normal cells are usually methylated. This methylation is present in hightly expressed genes and may help to inhibit antisense transcription, repress transcriptional noise etc. However gene body methylation in tumour cells is removed. I<span>n this case </span><span>the correct control of gene expression</span><span> is disturbed and epimutation changes may trigger mutational processes and lead to cancer.</span><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to DNMTs inhibitors and therefore is a hypomethylation agent. Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue (modification of 5-azacytidine) which incorporates into DNA instead of the correct nucleotide and irreversibly bind with DNMTs. This binding prevents DNA synthesis and have cytotoxic effect. Due to the fact that cancer cells devide more frequently than normal cells Decitabine have stronger toxic influence on cancer cells but not on normal cells.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In paternal allele ICR, as well as H19, is hypermethylated, so CTCF can't bind to this region. In this case enhancers can act on Igf2 and promote it expression. ICR of maternal allele is hypomethylated and therefore can bind with CTCF. Enhancers influence on H19 and promote it expression but Igf2 is silensed (is not expressed). In Wilm's tumour imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted and maternal allele becomes similar to paternal allele. It's mean that Igf2 is expressed by both alleles and organism have double dose of the product of this gene in comparison with normal cells (however H19 is not expressed). Igf2 overexpression is growth promoting and so it is associated with tumour growth.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><pre><code><br /></code></pre>DNA methylation is very stable epigenetic mark which can be inherited mitoticaly. However reprogramming of DNA methylation occurs during gametogenesis and after 
fertilization or after artificial reprogramming of somatic cells into 
induced pluripotent stem cells. So <span>methylation in these cells differ from the level of methylation in cells of the adult organism. That's why using of epigenetic drugs in sensetive periods of development is both not inefficient and harm  for the organism (expecially in composition with chemotherapy drugs).</span> Therefore <span>treatment of children and pregnant women with such preparations <span>is undesirable.</span></span><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
