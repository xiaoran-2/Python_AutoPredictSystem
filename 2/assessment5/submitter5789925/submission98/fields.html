    <h1>Submission 98 from Anon (session_user_id: 9584011f4a312a1d39e29f73bccad05a55230c6f)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor. It is a nucleoside analogue which binds permanently DNMTs after they are incorporated into the DNA, which the cell in replicating, preventing DNA-methylation. Therefore Decitabine reduces the amount of DNA methylation present. As cancer cells replicate more rapidly they are more affected by this drug. At low doses they are effective at causing DNA de-methylation of tumor cells and reducing the tumour. If the tumour is driven by this hypermethylation of tumour suppressor then depletion of DNA methylation can suppress tumorgenesis. However, if the tumour is driven by chomosomal instability and genome-wide hypomethylation, then DNA methylation depletion may enhance tumourigenesis. Decitabine may
also reduce tumours by causing apoptosis (cell death) through hypomethylation. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are usually unmethylated. When they are methylated this is normally due to silencing of gene expression.In cancer CpG islands and CpG island shores become hypermethylated, silencing the genes such as tumour suppressors, allowing tumour growth. For example, Wilms tumour  is caused by hypermethylation of the ICR for IGF2, causing overexpression of growth factor, leading to growth of tumours. <br /><p>Intergenic regions
and repetitive elements are normally methylated to help maintain genomic
stability by preventing unwanted transposition and transcriptional interference
from strong promoters. However in cancer intergenic regions and repetitive
elements are hypomethylated, causing genomic instability through erroneous
deletions, insertions, and reciprocal translocations.  This hypomethylation is seen in all tumour
types and progresses with tumorigenicity.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Disruption of imprinting by either hypo- or hyper-methylation at imprinting control regions (ICR) can contribute to cancer by causing a loss of expression of growth restricting genes, or overexpression of growth promoting genes. In the case of the H19/Igf2 cluster, the ICR is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele. On the maternal allele CTCF protein binds to the ICR and insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers, so Igf2 is inactive on the maternal allele. However, on the paternal allele the methylation at the ICR blocks CTCF from binding and DNA methylation spreads to and silences H19, allowing the enhancers to access Igf2 and activate it. In the case of Wilm's tumour the ICR is also methylated on the maternal allele, and so Igf2 is expressed on both alleles. This double expression of the growth promotor Igf2 causes Wilm's tumour, a cancer of the kidneys, usually found in children.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome, because although epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable, unlike mutations once epigenetic marks like DNA methylation are removed they are permanently lost and no longer will be passed on to subsequent cell generations.Therefore the altered state of DNA methylation will remain after drug treatment has finished.<br />You would want to avoid treating patients with such drugs during sensitive periods. These are developmental periods of active epigenetic reprogramming when altered environments can effect epigenetic control; specifically primordial germ cell development and early embryonic development. Therefore you would need to be careful giving these to pregnant women as it could affect the development of their baby, potentially causing imprinting disorders such as Prader-Willi Syndrome or poor health later in their lives. Also, pre-pubescent children in the 'slow-growth period' should maybe also be avoided being given this type of drug as their germ cells will still be maturing.</div>
