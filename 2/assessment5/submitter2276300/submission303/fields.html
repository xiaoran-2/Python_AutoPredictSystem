    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are groups of many repetitions of Cytosines followed by Guanines, which are usually located in the promoter area of many genes. When these areas are methylated, the nearby genes are not expressed. 
In cancer CpG islands and island shores are highly hypermethylated compared to normal cells. It has been shown that this is associated with loss of gene function of tumor supresor genes.
While in cancer CpG islands are hypermethylated, at a global view, the overall levels of methylation of the whole genome are lower than in normal cells. Specially in areas with low content of genes, such as repetitive elements or retrotransposons and introns, where cancer cells are hypomethylated. Since methylation in these regions is normally to keep genome stability, their hypomethylation leads to genomic instability, due to a higher rate of translocations and chromosomal rearrangements.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">lgf2 expression is regulated by a group of enhancers and its blockers. In order to be expressed it needs to accessible to downstream enhancers, which are only active when CTCF is not blocking them. This is the case of the paternal allele, where the ICR is not methylated, and therefore the enhances can promote lgf2 expression. On the other hand, on the maternal allele the ICR is not methylated, and therefore CTCF can bind there and block the lgf2 enhances. For this reason, LGF2 is only expressed in the paternal allele.
In Whilm’s tumour, the maternal allele is also methylated and therefore, it also express lgf2 (by inhibiting CTCF from binding to block the promoters…) and have a higher amount of lgf2, which is a growth promoting factor (can lead to cancer).</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi). Therefore, by inhibiting the enzymes that transfer the methyl groups to DNA (methyltransferases), it reduces the global methylation levels of DNA. Since DNA methylation inhibits the expression of nearby genes, when it happens on an area that regulates a tumor-suppressor gene, it might lead to cancer. In this way, by removing the methylation at the CpG islands of these genes, DNA-demethylating drugs, such as Decitabine, could have anti-tumor or anti-proliferative effects.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetics are those changes to DNA that without altering the DNA sequence are inherited during mitosis. DNA methylation is one of these epigenetics mechanisms and therefore, once it is altered in a cell, its descendants will inherit those modifications. This includes the effect of drugs, since once the drug has been taken and certain methylation parameters modified, the effect will persist until the methylation patterns are actively modified again.
Since DNA methylation is one of the ways to indicate a cell which genes it should express in order to determine its cell type, in multicellular organisms these marks need to be erased and reprogrammed in in germ cells in order to create a new whole organism. In humans, these clearing is performed in the formation of the gametes gametes and in certain phases of the embryo development (i.e. blastocyst). These moments are known as sensitive periods, and therefore, using drugs that modify DNA methylation during these phases should be done with extra care since they could have stronger or unexpected results.</div>
