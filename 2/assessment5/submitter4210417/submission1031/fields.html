    <div class="field-value">CpG islands in normal cells are generally unmethylated and are associated with silencing of gene expression downstream of the CpG island. In cancer cells, CpG islands are more likely to be methylated which results in genes downstream being more often expressed than usual. If the gene is a growth promoting gene, it may be a contributing factor to causing a cell to become a tumour.<br /><br />In contrast, DNA is usually methylated in intergenic regions and especially repetitive elements, which prevents these areas from being transcribed. This is important in order to maintain genomic stability and prevent certain DNA from jumping around the chromosome and onto other chromosomes. If the DNA of intergenic and repetitive elements is unmethylated, which tends to be the case in cancer cells, the cell is more likely to accumulate mutations which in turn enable the cell to grow uncontrollably and become more cancerous. It is not clearly understood if DNA hypomehtylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is the origin or the cause of cancerous cells. It is likely a contributing factor to both.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Igf2 is a paternally imprinted gene. On the maternal allele, there is a protein called CTCF which binds to a part of DNA downstream of the Igf2 cluster, in an area where DNA is unmethylated. This binding of the CTCF protein results in expression of the H19 gene which further downstream causes a set of enhancers to be silent, thus insulating the Igf2 gene and turning it silent. On the paternal allele in contrast, DNA methylation prevents binding of the CTCF gene downstream of Igf2, expressing the enhancers which in turn express the Igf2 gene.<br /><br />Wilm's tumour is a type of kidney cancer that only children develop. It is associated with the Igf2 gene because this gene is a growth promoter and thus classified as an oncogene. If imprinting is lost and the Igf2 is expressed on the paternal allele and the maternal allele (or two paternal alleles), Igf2 is expressed in a double dose. This is associated with abnormal fetal and childhood growth and Wilm's tumour.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is an epigenetic drug that is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, which are precursors to myelogenous leukaemia. It is on the market and is a DNA-demethylating agent - it removes DNA hypermethylation. This may be useful if hypermethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements are associated with certain cancers. If this hypermethylation is removed, the cell may express fewer oncogenes and thus become a benign cell. Despite this sounding like a too general type of drug to prevent harmful side effects, it seems to work well on patients for reasons scientists do not yet fully understand.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA-demethylating agents cause permanent epigenetic changes in a cell by removing methylation marks laid down to enhance or prevent the expression of certain genes. The epigenome is permanently altered because epigenetic changes are by definition mitotically heritable and will persist even if the drug is no longer present. Once laid down or removed, they are there to stay (or absent for good). This can make them very useful in treating cancer.<br /><br />However, patients must be careful when using drugs that alter the epigenome. If the cancer patient produces gametes and is reproductively active, the drug will have an effect on the epigenome of the gametes. This is because gametes need a set of epigenetic marks that makes them either male and female, which is a so-called sensitive period - the correct laying down of epigenetic marks during gamete production is essential for proper development of the sperm and egg. A second sensitive period is when the fetus is in the blastocyst stage, when all cells are pluripotent. All epigentic marks must be removed before this stage and then laid down again to determine the cell-type. Tinkering with the epigenome during sensitive periods is likely to be damaging and thus not advisable.</div>
