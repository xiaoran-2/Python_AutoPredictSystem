    <div class="field-value"><b>Introduction<br /></b>Methylation of DNA is a heritable, enzyme-induced modification to DNA 
structure without alteration of the specific sequence of the base pairs 
responsible for encoding the genome. DNA methylation can both directly 
inhibit the expression of genes and also increase the probability that 
affected genes undergo a mutational event. Although DNA methylation 
plays an essential role in normal biologic processes, distinct and 
abnormal patterns of methylation are observed in cancers. In particular,
 there has been increased documentation that methylation of  promoter
 regions of several genes, including known tumor suppressor genes, 
results in  subsequent failure to express their functional proteins. 
<br /><br /><b>Cancer</b><br />For many years, genetic changes that alter primary DNA sequence were 
thought to be the mechanism by which critical gene activities were lost 
in cancer. While these largely irreversible mutations are very common in
 cancer, it is now well established that DNA methylation plays a 
significant role in loss of gene function .
 Either homozygous methylation or methylation in combination with one of
 the genetic alterations has been described for multiple tumour 
suppressor genes and candidate cancer genes. Methylation can provide one
 of the hits postulated in Knudson's two hit hypothesis to inactivate 
tumour suppressor genes. Hypermethylation events in usually unmethylated
 CpG islands are found in a large number of cancer genes. Hypo- and 
hypermethylation events are found in the same tumour samples 
 indicating a defect in the regulatory mechanisms that participate in 
the establishment and maintenance of methylation patterns.Changes in the epigenome also activate  genes in stomach
 cancer, colon cancer and  kidney cancer.<br /><br /><b>Conclusion</b><br /><br /> Identification of the factors regulating DNA methylation and 
demethylation may reveal novel targets for therapeutic intervention. 
Because DNA methylation does not alter the primary DNA sequence and is 
reversible, epigenetics-based therapeutics may be able to restore the 
activity of silenced tumor suppressors even in advanced tumours.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your

<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;

    <div class="field-value"><b>Introduction<br /></b><br />Hyper- and hypomethylation at the <i>IGF2-H19</i> imprinting control region (ICR) result in reciprocal changes in <i>IGF2-H19</i> expression and the two contrasting growth disorders, Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome  and Silver–Russell syndrome .<br /><b>Cancer</b><br /><span><span>
</span></span><p>Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome often results from changes in a process 
called methylation that affects the ICR1 region. In genes that undergo 
genomic imprinting, the parent of origin is often marked, or "stamped," 
on the gene during the formation of egg and sperm cells. This stamping 
process, called methylation,  a chemical reaction that attaches small 
molecules called methyl groups to certain segments of DNA.</p>
<p>In some people with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, the ICR1 region has 
too many methyl groups attached (hypermethylation). Because the ICR1 
region controls the genomic imprinting of the H19 and IGF2
 genes, this abnormality disrupts the regulation of both genes. 
Specifically, hypermethylation of the ICR1 region leads to a loss of H19 gene activity and increased activity of the IGF2 gene in many tissues. <br /></p>
<p>In a few cases, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome has been caused by 
deletions of a small amount of DNA from the ICR1 region. Like abnormal 
methylation, these deletions disrupt the activity of the H19 and IGF2 genes,<span>cancers - associated with the IGF2 gene</span><br /></p><br /></div>

    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,

    <div class="field-value"><b>Introduction</b><br />Research results presented at the 2012 American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) annual meeting,
 offer new insights into an emerging treatment approach for cancer, 
known as epigenetic therapy. Rather than killing cancer cells by 
damaging their DNA or disrupting vital communication pathways.<br /><b>Results</b><br /><div>In
 a series of experiments, the investigators showed that low doses of 
decitabine and azacitidine inhibited cell growth and caused tumors to 
shrink in a xenograft model of breast cancer. Using cells from patients 
with metastatic breast cancer, Baylin and colleagues then demonstrated 
that 3 days of exposure to 500 nM of azacitidine effectively terminated 
the cells’ self-renewal properties. <br /><div>The
 complex activity and effects, “may actually give decitabine and 
azacitidine an important advantage in treating cancer cells where they 
may target all of these functions and their role in governing the 
epigenetic aberrancies present in cancer,” Baylin and colleagues wrote 
in the journal article. - <a title="Link: http://www.onclive.com/publications/obtn/2012/june-2012/Epigenetics-Breathes-New-Life-Into-Older-Cancer-Drugs#sthash.7NRfwXJU.dpuf" href="http://www.onclive.com/publications/obtn/2012/june-2012/Epigenetics-Breathes-New-Life-Into-Older-Cancer-Drugs#sthash.7NRfwXJU.dpuf"></a></div><br /><a href="http://www.onclive.com/publications/obtn/2012/june-2012/Epigenetics-Breathes-New-Life-Into-Older-Cancer-Drugs#sthash.7NRfwXJU.dpuf"></a></div><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>One effect of such processes is imprinting. In genetics, imprinting describes the condition where one of the two alleles of  typical gene pair is silenced by an epigenetic process such as methylation or acetylation. This becomes a problem if the expressed allele is damaged or contains  variant that increases the organism’s vulnerability to microbes, toxic agents, or other harmful substances. </p><p><br /></p><p>The term, Sensitive Period is a developmental term and refers to a time when a child is particularly receptive to certain kinds of environmental experiences. <br /></p><ul><li>You can recognize a sensitive period occurring when you see child your child developing a passion for a certain toy or activity.</li><li>He may be trying to acquire balance and is drawn to walk on  cracks of sidewalks.</li><li>Your child will spontaneously repeat the activity again and again until one day the cycle is finished.</li></ul><br /><br /><p><span>Sensitive periods are phases of active remodeling of the epigenome. Epigenetic marks get removed, and new epigenetic marks laid down. We have sensitive periods during germ cell development and during early development. If we alter DNA methylation during these sensitive periods, it would have a large effect on patients, leading to altered epigenomes, messed up gene expression, and alterations in the phenotype.</span><br /></p></div>
