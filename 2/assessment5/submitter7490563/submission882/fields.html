    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>If the imprint control region is methylated on the paternal allele
and not on the maternal allele, then CTCF will bind to the imprint region on
the maternal allele thus acting as an insulator forcing the enhancers to act on
H19 therefore making igf2 silent on the maternal allele causing an absence of
expression. Because the imprint region on the paternal allele is methylated,
CTCF does not bind to act as an insulator therefore the enhancers act on igf2 instead
of H19. The interaction between the enhancers and igf2 then causes expression
at the igf2 region. </p><p><span>Imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s
tumour from the loss of imprinting, hypermethylation of both the maternal and paternal
ICRs, igf2 is overexpressed causing Wilm’s tumour  </span></p>

<p> Disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to
cancer by either both paternal alleles being active (causing Wilm’s tumour due
to Igf2 being growth promoting,) or both will be silenced (causing Beckwith-Wiedemann
Syndrome and possible cancer)</p><span>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>

<p>The normal function of DNA methylation at a CpG island is to
silence the gene, this is an inactive epigenetic mark. </p>

<p><span> DNA methylation of
CpG islands is disrupted in cancer by a gain of silencing marks and loss of
activation marks at the CPG islands</span></p>

<p>CPG islands are sometimes the shores of tumor suppressor
genes that get silence not allowing the activation of tumor suppressing genes.</p>

<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements should both be
methylated in normal functioning cells, this ensures the maintenance of genomic
integrity.</p>

<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are unmethylated
in cancerous cells; this causes genomic instability produced by illegitimate
deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations. </p><span>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine has an antineoplastic effect; it is a DNA methyl
transferase inhibitor and demethylates hypermethylated regions that cause
myelodysplastic syndrome.</p><p> </p><span>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>epigenetic changes (like altering
methylation) are passed on to daughter and granddaughter cells during cell
division until they are actively erased. This allows the epigenetic changes to
be affective long after administering the initial treatment</p>

<p>A sensitive period is a stage in cell development that is
sensitive to epigenetic changes, at this stage the cell is clearing epigenetic
marks to restore totipotency. There are two waves in early development, the
preimplantation period and primordial germ cell development. Treatment during
these periods may distort DNA methylation imprints, thus negatively effecting
development.</p><span>
