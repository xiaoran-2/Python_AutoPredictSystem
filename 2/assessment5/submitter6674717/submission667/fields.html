    <div class="field-value">CpG islands (CGIs) are CG rich
regions in promoters of a gene, that are responsible for controlling
the expression of a particular gene. If the cytosine of the CG
repeats are methylated it leads to silencing of that gene. It means
that in a cell that does not require a particular protein for its
function, it will methylate the CpG islands present in the promoters
of all those genes thus silencing them. 

<p>All the terminally differentiated
cells in an organ express only those genes whose proteins are
required for the function of the cell. Genes for replication and cell
division are silenced by CpG methylation. Thus such cells can only
perform their specific functions and after a specific time periods
initiate apoptotic pathways and are eliminated from the organs. These
cells are replaced by new terminally differentiated cells arising
from the organs’ stem cells. If hypo-methylation occurs at the
promoters of the genes coding for proteins required for cell
proliferation such proteins will get expressed in the cell and the
cell will start replication and cell division leading to initiation
of cancer. Also in normal cells there are proteins that are expressed
that are involved in tumor suppression. If promoters of such genes
get methylated at CGIs their expression is prevented leading to cell
proliferation. Thus hypo-methylation of some CpG islands and
hyper-methylation of others leads to uncontrolled cell proliferation
i.e. cancer.</p>
<p>The intra-geneic repeat regions that
do not code for genes also are methylated so that they do not involve
in recombination processes due to sequence homologies between the
chromosomes. Thus in a normal cell chromosomal aberrations such as
deletion, insertions and recombinations are prevented. If
hypomethylation of such intra geneic regions occur, chromosomal
abnormalities can occur because of transposons and other repeats,
leading eventually to cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p style="margin-bottom:.35cm;">Genomic imprinting is expression of
some genes from only specific alles, i.e either maternal or paternal
but not both. This is seen mostly in genes coding for growth factors
that bring about cell proliferation. Since if both the genes are
active it might lead to excessive expression of the protein and
uncontroled cell proliferation. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:.35cm;">Igf2 is one such gene that codes for
insulin like growth factor. Igf2/H19 locus is a locus on chromosome
11. <i>H19 </i><span style="font-style:normal;">is
unmethylated on maternal copy and hence is </span>expressed leading
to expression of CTCF protein that binds to enhancer proteins and
prevents them from binding to IGF2 promoter. H19 gene on the paternal
allele is methylated hence the CTCF protein is also not expressed and
doesnot quench the enhancer proteins. The enhancer proteins are free
to initiate IGF2 protein synthesis by binding to its promoter. Thus
when H19 is methylated IGF2 protein is synthesized.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:.35cm;">In Willm's tumor there is
hyper-methylation of meternal H19 gene and hence it is not active
both in paternal and maternal allele. This leads to expression of
IGF2 protein from both these allels. Since IGF2 is a growth factor
cell proliferation is enhanced leading to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p style="margin-bottom:.35cm;">Hyper-methylation of histones on
chromosomes leads to silencing of supressor genes that eventually
leads to onset of cancer because of uncontrolled growth of cells.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:.35cm;">Decitabine is <font face="serif"><font size="3">nucleoside
2’-deoxycytidine. Decitabine gets incorporated in the DNA and
brings about hypo-methylation of DNA by inhibiting DNA methyl
transferase. DNA sysnthesis is not inhibitted, also non proliferating
cells are not affected by this drug. Reduced methylation of tumor
suppressor genes leads to proper growth of the cells and excessive
growth is inhibitted. Thus preventing cancer progression.</font></font></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p style="margin-bottom:.35cm;">DNA methy lation at specific
locations such at CpG loci leads to changes in the  expression levels
of several genes. In genral methylation of DNA leads to gene
silencing. Thus those genes in the genome which are to be silenced
trough out the life time of the organism are sinlenced by methylating
the CpG loci in the promotors of such genes. The DNA methylation
pattern is correctly copied onto the daughter cells without being
modified. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:.35cm;">Thus if the cells are treated to
modify the methylation patterns by treating with drugs such patterns
would be copied into new cells there by making them susseptible to
chemotherapeutic drugs. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:.35cm;">Since the methylation pattern is
mitotically unchangable, the peroids during which these methylation
marks are removed during the life cycle, i.e during primordial germ
cell dvelopment and pre implantation and early post implantation
periods would be the sensitive periods. During these 2 periods drugs
altering DNA methylation are to be avoided for treatment.</p></div>
