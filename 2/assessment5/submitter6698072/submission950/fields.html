    <div class="field-value">Generally in a normal cell, CpG islands are unmethylated, and if they are methylated, it is associated with gene silencing at that promoter.  In cancer, CpG islands and even CpG shores increase in methylation levels, and the levels increase progressively with the cancer, and the location of methylated CpG islands varies with tumor type.  If the CpG island is a gene promoter, then methylation will usually silence the promoter, and this will suppress gene expression.  If the gene under suppression is a tumor suppressor, then the cell is unable to regulate its own growth, thus causing a tumor to form.  Moreover, since these marks are mitotically heritable, these cells will have a competitive advantage, and will be rapidly selected for.  The key difference between a genetic mutation and an epigenetic mark is that it is reversible, unlike the genetic mutation, thus making it a possible target for cancer therapy.

In intergenic regions and repetitive elements, DNA is normally hypermethylated in order to possibly silence cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic slice sites, to prevents transposition of repeat by silencing or possibly mutating them, silencing strong promoters found on repeats, and to prevent illegitimate recombination and maintain overall genetic stability (genome defense model).  But in cancer, these genomic regions are hypomethylated, a hallmark that is more consistent than genetic mutations!  This lack of methylation at these regions could contribute to cancer by causing overall genomic instability that may literally break genes in half, cause translocations that will splice different parts of different proteins together, or cause duplications of genese, such as an oncogene!  Also, if repeat elements become mobile due to a lack of methylation, they could also reinsert themselves into other genes, disrupting them.  Finally, if the hypomethylation is at a CpG poor promoter, it could be activating an oncogene.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The mechanism of the H19/Igf2 cluster is enhancer blocking.  On the paternal allele, the imprint control region (ICR) is methylated, which blocks binding of the insulator protein CTCF.  This allows enhancers downstream of the ICR by possible chromatin looping to activate Igf2 expression upstream of the methylated ICR.  On the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated, thus allowing binding of CTCF.  This blocks access of the downstream enhancers to the Igf2 promoter, thus the maternal allele of Igf2 is not expressed.  This is referred to as being paternally imprinted.  In Wilm's tumor this imprinting is lost, and both the paternal and maternal allele are now methylated at the ICR, thus causing biallelic expression of Igf2.  Since Igf2 is a gene involved in growth, having two copies being expressed causes cell overgrowth, and a tumor to form.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a small-molecule drug that inhibits DNA methyltranferases, or DNMT in a systemically non-specific manner, and is currently being used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes and AML.  It is a cytidine analog that gets incorporated into replicating DNA, and then covalently binds DNMT once it attempts to methylate the analog. The overall effect of Decitabine is to demethylate DNA through the inhibition of methylation, and is dependent on cell replication.  When administered to patients with cancer at low doses, decitabine causes DNA demethylation, which has a favorable outcome to patients with leukemia.  It is unclear specifically why this happens, but it is known that patients with AML who have a high level of CpG island methylation have a very poor prognosis.  It is also known that many haemetological malignancies have hypermethylated tumor suppressor genes, so perhaps it is through the removal of these that the drug works.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can have an enduring effect on the genome because this type of epigenetic mark is mitotically heritable, so once these epigenetic drugs remove these marks, the marks don't come back in subsequent generations of the cell.  Sensitive periods are defined as those times in development or the life cycle of an adult's reproductive phase when epigenetic marks are being laid down, and not just maintained.  This is clearly true for a baby, child or adolescent, when these drugs could damage their own growth and development.  But also, this is true for pregnant women!  Not only would the drugs damage her developing fetus, but also the primordial germ cells growing inside the baby itself.  Moreover, I would suspect that any man or woman who would like to have children should not be treated with these drugs, I suspect even their gametes would be heavily damaged, but of course, if it's a matter of their own survival, I would advise that they choose the treatment.</div>
