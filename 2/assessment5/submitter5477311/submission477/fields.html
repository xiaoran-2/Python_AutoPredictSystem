    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are usually found  in promoter regions, about a 60% of them. This regions are free of methylation most of the times, independent of their activity state. But in cancer cells, it is found a hypermethylation in the Cpg islands. This hypermethylation causes  silencing of genes. <br /> Intragenic methylation is found at repetitive sequences such as 
satellite repeats and remnants of retroviral insertions such as LINEs 
and SINEs in human DNA.
 Gene body methylation is present in highly expressed genes and it has 
been speculated that this may repress transcriptional noise from 
alternative start sites, inhibit antisense transcription or direct RNA 
splicing and relates to replication timing. Studies show that many of these regions which are hipomethylated are involved in human cancers.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div> ICR1  regulates IGF2 and H19 monoallelic  expression, leading  to IGF2 transcription  from  the  paternal  and H19 from  the  maternal allele. Expression of these two genes is controlled by differential and coordinated methylation of ICR1, DMR2 and the H19 promoter, constituting a parentally-inherited epigenetic trait. <br />Binding of  ICR1  to  CTCF  mediates  higher-order  chromatin  conformation, partitioning paternal and maternal IGF2 alleles into active and inactive chromatin domains. CTCF binding to the maternal unmethylated ICR1 results in a specific change in chromatin  loop  structure  and  prevents  the IGF2 gene  promoter  from interacting  with  enhancers  downstream  of  the H19gene,  thus resulting in transcriptional silencing of the maternal IGF2 allele. On the paternal allele, DNA methylation prevents CTCF binding and permissive for IGF2 gene activation.<br />About Wilm's tumor some studies specified loss of imprinting (LOI) in a differential methylated 
region (DMR) of the IGF2/H19 cluster or loss of heterozygosity (LOH), 
respectively, uniparental disomy (UPD) being responsible for this 
overexpression.<br />In humans, germline-derived or post-zygotically acquired imprinting 
defects at IC1 are associated with aberrant activation or repression of <i>IGF2</i>,
 resulting in the congenital growth disorders. In 
colorectal cancer, biallelic expression of <i>IGF2</i> has been observed in association with loss of methylation at a DMR in <i>IGF2.</i><br /></div><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a hipomethylation agent, it hipomethylates by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. This drug can be incorporated in DNA strands, this mechanism leads this drug to act on aberrant DNA. As in myelodysplastic syndromes, in which abeerant DNA methylation occur, Decitabine is an potential agent. This drug indirectly depletes methylcytosine and causes hypomethylation of target gene promoters.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Enduring effects on the epigenome caused by drugs ould be possible because of epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. <br />A sensitive period is the moment in cell development in which cells are more likely to hace functional changes in genes without altering DNA sequence itself. <br /></div>
