    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is a biochemical process where a methyl group is added to the cytosine or adenine DNA nucleotides. DNA methylation at CpG islands is associated with silencing of genes. In cancer DNA methylation abnormality takes place. In general at a cancer cell, the CpG islands are more likely to be methylated. They're not all methylated, but they're more likely to be methylated than in a normal cell. while the rest of the genome , including the repetitive elements in these intergenic elements, and the introns, are hypomethylated. This is known as called CpG island hypermethylation and it works as a way to inactivate a tumor-suppresor genes. Most of the genome is made up of intergenic intervals or repetitive elements where in general the CpG islands are mostly methylated in a normal cell. But in cancer, these regions tend to become hypomethylated. one of the functions of DNA methylation in intergenic intervals or repetitive element is to maintain genomic stability and to make sure that genetically the genome remains normal and we don’t lose chromosomes, gain chromosomes or have illegitimate recombinations between chromosomes which shouldn't occur. . But in the context of cancer we have hypomethylation of these repetitive elements or the intergenic regions. They align, they misalign, and then an illegitimate recombination can occur because they are not densely packaged down into heterochromatin. Repeats can also be activated because of the hypomethylation. They may disrupt the coding region of a gene but it also may activate neighboring genes. These events of genetic instability might help to promote cancers or tumour genesis.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">There are many imprint control regions in the genome. H19/Igf2 cluster is one of them. It is methylated on the paternal allele and it is unmethylated on the maternal allele. When it's unmethylated CTCF binds its insulator element, and it means that the enhancers in this case will act on H19. But Igf2 will be silent for the maternal allele, so we don't see expression. On the paternal allele, because this is methylated, now the enhancers. Can act on IGF2, because CTCF is not binding to inhibit this, and IGF2 is expressed from the pattern allele. However, if there is a loss of imprinting the thing what will happen is that you will have hypermethylation of the imprint control region on the maternal allele as well. Now, on the maternal allele, you also have expression of Igf2. So now you have a double dose of Igf2 in comparison to what is found in a normal cell. And Igf2 is both growth promoting, and this is associated with Wilm's tumour. IGF2 undergoes loss of imprinting (LOI) in most Wilms' tumours (WT).</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. It functions in a similar manner to azacitidine, although decitabine can only be incorporated into DNA strands while azacitidine can be incorporated into both DNA and RNA chains. Decitabine is indicated for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes. Decitabine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects after phosphorylation and direct incorporation into DNA and inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, causing hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis. Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation in vitro , which is achieved at concentrations that do not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation and gives it the anti cancer effect.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The epigenome is dynamic and responsive to environmental signals not only during development, but also throughout life; and it is becoming increasingly apparent that chemicals can cause changes in gene expression that persist long after exposure has ceased. A two-tier mechanism is postulated for indirect effects in which acute exposure to a drug influences signaling pathways that may lead to an alteration of transcription factor activity at gene promoters. This stimulation results in the altered expression of receptors, signaling molecules, and other proteins necessary to alter genetic regulatory circuits. With more chronic exposure, cells adapt by an unknown hypothetical process that results in more permanent modifications to DNA methylation and chromatin structure, leading to enduring alteration of a given epigenetic network. Therefore, any epigenetic side effect caused by a drug may persist after the drug is discontinued.Early life constitutes a period during which there is increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms. So this is called the sensitive periods of development. Patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because it may alter their epigenome permanently.</div>
