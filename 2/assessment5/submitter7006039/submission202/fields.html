    <div class="field-value">1. DNA methylation within promoter regions of genes negatively correlates 
with expression levels of the gene except in CpG islands, which are 
usually  kept free of methylation. 
Highly tissue-specific genes usually lack islands.
The contrast between islands and the remainder of the genome may 
identify sequences that are to be constantly available in the nucleus. Dna methylation appears to be involved in this function, rather than with activation of tissue specific genes.
<br />2. in cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene.<br />3. DNA methylation is an alternative to genetic mutation, to silence tumour suppressor genes in cancer. Tumour suppressor hypermethylation is often more frequent than mutations. Identity of hypermethylated CGIs varies by tumour type, as confirmed by genome-wide DNA methylation studies.<br /><div>4. DNA methylation changes in intergenic regions and repetitive elements are associated with
 the regulation of gene transcription, embryonic development and differentiation.<br />5. While cells are in general hypermethilated in intergenic regions containing repetitive elements, in cancers transposons and endogenous retroviruses can become hypomethilated and expressed.<br />6. CpG methylation of oncogene promoter regions and repeat sequences is decreased in cancer and this leads to chromosome instability.<br /></div><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">1. Mouse <i>H19</i> gene is hypermethylated on the inactive paternal allele throughout development. Methylation leads to repression of the paternal allele of <i>H19.</i> Deletion of the enhancers on the paternal chromosome results in the corresponding loss of <i>Igf2</i> expression. Whereas the imprinted expression of <i>Igf2</i> is dependent upon linkage to the <i>H19</i> locus, the imprinting of <i>H19</i> appears to be autonomous.<br />2.Upon maternal transmission of the mutation, <i>H19</i> expression is reduced and <i>Igf2</i> is activated.<br />3.Loss of Imprinting of IGF2 sense and antisense transcripts occurs in Wilms’ tumor. IGF2 is overexpressed. Although IGF2 is normally only transcribed from the paternal allele  this maternal imprinting is lost, leading to biallelic expression of the gene.<br />4. Hyper- and hypomethylation at the <i>IGF2-H19</i> imprinting control region  result in reciprocal changes in <i>IGF2-H19</i> expression and the two contrasting growth disorders.. The chromatin associated with the <i>Igf2-H19</i> ICR carries allele-specific histone modifications. DNA methylation changes at the ICR are accompanied by allele-specific
                     chromatin changes. Methylation and histone 
modifications at the ICR further affect chromatin conformation between 
several
                     CTCF–cohesin binding sites at the locus, to 
generate contrasting structures in BWS and SRS cells.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">1.Drugs that inhibit DNA methyltransferases or histone deacetylases were 
shown to have the potential to reactivate silenced genes and induce 
differentiation or apoptosis of malignant cells. The most intensively studied class of such agents is DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, including Decitabine.<br />2.Decitabine induces very early in vivo Dna methylation changes in blasts from patients with acute myeloid leukemia.<br />3.Decitabine's anticancer effects are believed to be twofold.   One way  is by demethylation or interfering with the methylation of DNA. 
            By this process of demethylation, normal function to the tumor suppressor genes
            is restored, thus restoring control over cell growth. Decitabine also belongs to the category of chemotherapy called antimetabolites,very similar to normal substances within the cell.  When
            the cells incorporate these substances into the cellular metabolism, they interact
            with a number of targets within the cell to produce a direct cytotoxic effect that
            causes death of rapidly dividing cancer cells.

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>1.Alterations in DNA methylation at ICRs (hypo or hypermethylation), can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes, overexpression of growth promoting genes. </div>2. Sensitive period is an extended period of time during development when an individual is more 
receptive to specific types of environmental stimuli, usually because 
nervous system development is especially sensitive to certain sensory 
stimuli. <br />3. Early life constitutes a period during which there is increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms. Pregnancy is another.<br />4. Treatment is most likely to be effective during the earliest part of  critical periods, that is  periods during a developmental or rehabilitation crisis after which treatment would be ineffective and possibly negatively interfere.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
