    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are regions with a high frequency of CpG sites,i.e. Cytosine neighboring Guanine. They are found in 60% of all promotor regions and are normally kept free from methylation independent of their activation state. CpG island methylation is, however, essential for maintenance of X-chromosome inactivation and this methylation also has well-characterized roles in genomic imprinting where parent-of-origin monoallelic
                     expression is controlled by CpG island methylation marks.<br />In cancer cells promotor CpG islands tend to become 
hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the oftenly underlying tumor suppressor gene. Examples for hypomethylation are RB in retinoblastom, BRCA1 in breast cancer and MLH1 in colorectal cancer. In contrast to this hypermethylation, the hypomethylation of CpG islands has been associated with the over-expression of oncogenes within cancer cells. Silencing of tumor suppressor genes and overexpression of oncogenes both are thought to contribute to uncontrolled cell proliferation and thus tumor development.<br />Intergenic regions and repetitive elements normally are methylated and therefore silenced. Hypomethylation of intergenic regions in cancer cells leads to activation of cryptic promotors or cryptic splicing sites. Hypomethylation of repeats may lead to illegitimate recombination between repeats and thus to transposition mutations and a general genomic instability which then may lead to cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Igf2 and H19 are localized next to each other with an imprint control region (ICR) in between them. This ICR is paternally imprinted, that means it's methlated in the paternal allele and unmethylted in the maternal allele. If the ICR is unmethylated as in the maternal allele it binds to an insulator protein (CTCF) which then insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers and so the enhancers act via chromatin looping on H19 to enhance expresssion of the long noncoding RNA H19. On the paternal allele however when CTCF cannot bind to the methylated ICR there is no insulator protein protecting Igf2 and therefore the enhancers enhance expression of Igf2. On the other hand methylation of the ICR spreads to H19 which is then also methylated and no longer expressed. <br />In Wilm's tumor there is a loss of imprinting on the maternal allele. The maternal chromosome reverses to a paternal 
epigenotype, with a paternal pattern of methylation of the H19 promoter,
 IGF2 turned on, and H19 turned off, causing increased cell growth. Because H19 functions to slow cell growth and Igf2 stimulates cell growth, loss of imprinting at the Igf2/H19<i></i> locus results in uncontrolled cell growth that can lead to tumor formation.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-hypomethylating agent and is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, 
the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.Decitabine is a Cytidine analogue which becomes incorporated in the DNA during DNA replication and then inhibits DNA methyltransferase. As tumor cells replicate much more than normal cells they will be stronger affected by this hypomethylation than normal body cells.  Decitabine - induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cellular<div>differentiation and proliferation.<br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprinting of genes through DNA methylation is a pattern which is normally maintained in all mitotic daughter cells. so hypo- or hypermethylation of DNA in a tumor cell will be passed on to all daughter cells.<br />There are two sensitive periods with epigenetic reprogramming: First in early development in the fertilized egg up to the stage of blastocyst, second in primordial germ cells. Epigenetic reprogramming means that most epigenetic marks are removed and later on reestablished. In rats there has been shown that the first weeks after birth are also a sensitive period because licking of the pups by the mother lead to an 
altered offspring epigenome at a glucocorticoid receptor gene 
promoter in the hippocampus.<br />Treating pregnant woman wirh epigenetically active drugs could therefore have a high impact of the epigenome of the unborn baby and should therefore be avoided.<br /></div>
