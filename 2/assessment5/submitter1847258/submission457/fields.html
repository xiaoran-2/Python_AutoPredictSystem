    <div class="field-value">     CpG islands are a group or clusters of dinucleotides appearing as lollipop like structures usually found at promoter regions of the gene and also sparingly at the intergenic regions and repetitive elements regions of the gene.The normal function of the DNA methylation by DNA methytransferases at CpG islands is to methylate these CpG islands resulting in suppressing the expression of the promoter gene. When the promoters of the tumor suppressing genes are suppressed, it results in non-expression of the tumor suppression gene which functions to prevent the formation of tumour that can be malignant.<br />     The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to maintain stability of the gene by imprinting or limiting expression so as to prevent mutation and translocations. When the normal methlylations at the CpG islands are removed by demethylation, it would result in instability causing the the expression of these genes. When an oncogene is expressed due to removal of the methylation, it becomes active resulting in cancer. <br />     In summary, there are two safeguards against cancer, namely the tumour suppressing gene and the oncogene. In normal tissues, the tumour supressing gene is expressed due to hypomethylation of the CpG islands and the neighbouring shores while the oncogene is suppressed due to hypermethylation. Epigenetic changes in either one or both of these two patterns by carcinogens may result in malignant tumour formation which in turn leads to metastasis cancers.   </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">            Decitabine is an epigenetic drug manufactured by the Japanese pharmaceutical company called Eisai and available in the market as Dacogen. It is an epigenetic inhibitor and its mode of action is hypomethylatiion acting as a DNA-demethylating agent used in treatment myelodyplastic syndromes which are precursors of acute blood disease called myelogenous leukemia.<br />            The mode of action of Decitabine is similar to azacitidine.Decitabine hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. DNA methyltransferase acts by demethylating the CpG islands of the promoter of the myelodyplastic causing gene which was hypermethylated in cancer patients showing myelodyplastic syndrome. <br />             Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect as it removes the methyl groups at the CpG islands and once these CpG islands methylations are removed,they do not return. in order words, when the tumour is removed, it will not come back.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">       Dr. Stephen Baylin's speculation is supported by the fact thatepigenetic drugs that cause the epigenetic changes such as DNA demethylation are different from other forms of gene regulation drugs such as transcription factor drugs. The demethylation is mitoically inheritable and passed on during cell division to daughter and future cells. Once the methylation is removed by epigenetic drug like Decitabine, the methylation do not come back.<br />       It is found that early life is sensitive to regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms. Sensitive period is defined as the time periods when there is genome-wide epigenetic reprogramming and these occur during embryo development and primordial germ cells development.<br />      During these sensitive period, there is reprogramming and reestablishment of epigenetic marks going on. Treating patients with epigenetic drugs such as demethylating agents is inadvisable because once the epigenetic marks are removed, reestablishment during critical period may not properly resulted because of the instability of the epigenome. This would result in aberration of the epigenomic pattern due to hypomethylation leading to disorders such as subfertility and imprinting disorder.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">        In a normal cell, the paternal allele of the H19 gene is imprinted due to hypermethylated at both the Imprint Control Region ICR and the CpG islands of the H19 gene. The enhancers can therefore act upon the Igf2 gene which is growth promoting. The maternal allele is unmethylated at the ICR. The CTCF can bind to the ICR so the H19 is expressed and will act on the enhancers preventing them from acting on the Igf2 gene. As a result Igf2 of the maternal allele is silenced. So in a normal cell, there is only one expression of the Igf2 allele and one dose of protein of Igf2 product.<br />        In patients with Wilm's tumour, the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted by the methylation of the ICR and H19 genes of both maternal and paternal allele. There is no inhibition of the enhancers and both Igf2 of the maternal and paternal alleles are expressed resulting in double dosage of Igf2. Because Igf2 is a growth promoting protein, it will cause kidney cancer typically occurring in children.</div>
