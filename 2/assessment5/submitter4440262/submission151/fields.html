    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation, which normally blocks gene transcription, encounters an exception at CpG islands where methylation levels sufficient to block access to promoters rarely occur , methylation at Cpg islands is speculated to serve the useful purpose of blocking discovery of evolutionary unfavored promoters whilst transcriping highly preserved sections; transcriptional noise.<br />In cancer cells a hypermethylated state can be obtained at a CpG island thereby suppressing a gene which should be always expressed; and should the gene suppressed be a tumor suppressing gene; this double suppression; can lead to no suppression of tumor growth.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The paternally expressed IncRNA AIR serves the role of suppressing the maternally expressed expressed Igf2r; DNA methylation of the H19/Igf2 cluster controls the reciprocal imprinting of Igf2 and H19 by preventing the binding of the insulator protein CTCF.<br />ICR1 directs parent of origin-specific expression of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2). IGF2 is normally expressed only from the paternal allele, while the untranslated <i>H19</i><span> gene is expressed from the maternal allele. Differential methylation of ICR1 on the paternal allele mediates differential binding of CTCF and formation of chromatin structures supporting expression of either H19 or IGF2, but not both.<br /></span><span>Hypermethylation of ICR1 can lead to the unregulated growth of tumor cells.</span><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the class of drugs known as DNA methylating agents; <span>it functions  as a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor and can reactivate epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor genes in vitro; and therefore has an anti-tumor effect.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs which modify the DNA methylation status can have enduring effects after drug cessation due to daughter cells enjoying the same methylation status as the parent. So altering DNA methylation during a sensitive time when an abundance of cells are pluripotent; such as embryo development can have enormous impact on the fully developed terminally differentiated being.</div>
