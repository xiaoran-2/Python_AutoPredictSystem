    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">The CpGis of normal cells tend to be hypomethylated to allow expression, while repetitive elements and IGRs tend to show hypermethylation for silencing.  This pattern is essentially reversed in cancer cells, with hypermethylation at CpG islands and hypomethylation at repetitive elements and intergenic regions.  The hypermethylation at CpG islands in cancer cells tends to be locus specific, and can vary by cancer type.  We can use these loci along with hypermethylation along the "shores" of these islands, 2kb in either direction, as biomarkers that can potentially identify the type of cancer present, or even the identity of the primary tumor when more than one cancer type exists.  The hypermethylation of CpG islands in cancer likely promotes tumorgenesis by silencing tumor suppressor genes.  Additionally in cancer, many repetitive elements and intergenic regions show global hypomethylation.  This can promote genomic instability by several different mechanisms.  There may be illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats that are normally silenced, a loss of imprinting, and the disruption of neighboring genes.  Hypomethylation may also contribute to nuclear restructuring and the unpackaging of heterochromatin.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Aberrations of DNA methylation at ICRs can result in the loss of imprinting by the overexpression of growth promoters or a silencing of growth suppressors.  Scientists believe this may happen early in tumorgenesis.  The hypermethylation of the Igf2/H19 cluster is a good example.  Normally, on the maternal allele, this IGR is unmethylated, allowing the binding of CTCF.  This allows enhancers to act on H19 and silences the expression of Igf2.  On the paternal allele, this region is methylated, so the CTCF complex cannot bind.  As a result, the enhancers act on Igf2 for the expression of this growth promoter.  In Wilm's tumor, we see hypermethylation of this IGR on the maternal allele.  Once this methylation occurs, Igf2 is produced similarly to the paternal allele, resulting in overexpression.  Because Igf2 is a growth promoter, large unchecked doses enhance tumorgenesis in cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine, or Dacogen, is a type of epigenetic enzymatic regulator called a DNMT inhibitor and is approved by the FDA to treat AML.  As a replication dependent nucleoside analog, Decitabine gets incorporated into the DNA to irreversibly bind DNMT and prevent methylation marks from being transferred to daughter cells.  Cancer cells, that divide much more rapidly than healthy cells, are more profoundly impacted by this amendment, as the removal of these methyl marks may reactivate tumor suppressors and growth inhibitors.    This drug must be used in a particular dosage range to be effective at reducing DNA methylation, and higher dosages can be toxic.  Although it is in clinical trials for many types of cancer, it seems to be more effective where there is hypermethylation of CpG islands present, and its mechanisms are not well understood.  <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic abnormalities are reversible and therapies can be passed to daughter cells and beyond until they are actively erased.  Once they are erased, they do not return.  DNA methylation marks in particular are mitotically heritable, and adding or suppressing these marks can affect the expression or silencing of particular genes for several cellular generations, including the genes that promote or inhibit tumorgenesis.  We do not yet have a clear grasp of how these mechanisms work, and it is likely that epigenetic therapies have consequences for healthy cells that we do not yet understand.  The sensitive periods in early embryonic development and primordial germ cell development when epigenetic marks are actively cleared and pluripotency factors are active are of particular concern.  We cannot yet predict how epigenetic treatments affect these processes, and particular care must be taken while treating individuals who could be affected by these developmental concerns.  <br /></div>
