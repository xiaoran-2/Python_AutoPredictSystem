    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer there is global DNA hypomethylation accompanied by more tightly-focussed DNA hypermethylation.  These effects tend to become more marked as the cancer progresses to metastasis.  DNA methylation of cytosine in CG dinucleotides is common in
normal cell DNA except for CpG islands within a promoter region (occurs about
60% of the time) where there is normally no methylation.   In the
absence of a CpG island within a promoter, gene expression tends to be
inversely related to promoter methylation.  CpG
islands in promoters commonly have their methylation increased resulting in
reduced gene expression.  When this occurs
for tumour suppressor genes there is poor control of cell replication,
typically resulting in tumour development. Distant regulatory elements, such as
enhancers, tend to be demethylated in active genes.  Global hypomethylation will increase
expression of the associated genes.  DNA
methylation is also associated with histone modifications, for instance through
methylated DNA providing a scaffold for trans-acting factors that facilitate chromatin
remodelling.  DNA methylation of
repetitive elements tends to stabilise the genome, but hypomethylation of these
regions in cancer allows aberrant transpositioning, including deletions, insertions and translocations as well as cryptic promoter
activity. Other
intergenic regions include non-CpG promoters and reduced methylation of these
up-regulates the relevant gene.  Large
scale unselective regulation of expression in differentiated cells is more
likely to be harmful than beneficial. Note that epigenetic changes in cells tend to be carried through to the next generation, so cells with up-regulated activity will preferentially reproduce and hence tend to outgrow properly functioning cells.  Hence the emergence of tumours as the signature of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Imprinting involves sex-specific
inheritance of particular genes.  The
H19/Igf2 cluster depends on DNA non-methylation on the maternal allele that
allows CTCF blocking of an enhancer for Igf2, while methylation of the paternal
allele prevents such blocking with the result that Igf2 is expressed through
the paternal allele.  If it happens that
the promoter on the maternal allele is also methylated then CTCF binding does
not occur on that allele either, so the downstream enhancer is able to act on
Igf2 from the maternal allele as well, and hence Igf2 production is typically
doubled.  Igf2 is a growth promoter leading
to too much growth in cell-types where this occurs, and so giving rise to a
tumour. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylator – that is, it removes
methylation from cytosine hence reducing CpG methylation.  After chemical modification to incorporate a
triphosphate it gets incorporated into DNA and inhibits DNA methyltransferase, leading
to hypomethylation of DNA.  This
incorporation depends on the cell undergoing replication and so preferentially occurs
in tumour cells.  Tumourous cells
typically suffer from promoter hypermethylation that silences tumour
suppressors, hence hypomethylation will favour up-regulation of tumour suppression.  It is believed to allow cells to regain
normal differentiation and apoptsosis functions, typically lost in certain
cancer tumour cells.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The essence of an epigenetic phenomenon is that it is mitotically inheritable - so reproducing cells in an organism pass some of the epigenetic marks  to their progeny.  DNA methylation at a particular genomic location can be replicated in daughter cells due to the action of DNMT1 on hemi-methylated DNA. Thus if a cell is exposed to some drug that causes methylation of a particular genomic region then the daughter cells may also have that same methylation, though never being exposed directly to the methylating drug.  There are periods during mammalian development during which cells are particularly susceptible to epigenetic modification - in particular during development from zygote to epiblast, and during primordial germ cell development.  These are known as "sensitive periods" in mammalian development. During sensitive periods there are critical epigenetic re-programming activities occurring which, if they were to be disrupted, would be likely to cause major alterations to development of the organism.  Additionally, there are also periods that differ for different cell types where cells move from paused states to differentiated.  These periods are also best considered sensitive periods in that epigenetic engineering (e.g. via drugs) could have broader effects than intended, such as programming limb development in face tissue.  </div>
