    <h1>Submission 361 from Anon (session_user_id: f93f13ba2f4e85cbdc1b04bffea081674e0c5765)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of epigenetic
inhibitors called the methyl-transferase (DNMTi) inhibitors. DNMT maintains DNA
methylation and Decitabine irreversibly binds to DNMT. Decitabine works at the
time of cell replication and overall demethylates the cells. <span><br /><span>As
cancer cells divide rapidly, the effect of Decitabine will be to reduce the
overall DNA methylation in the cells. This should avoid the silencing of tumour
suppressor genes, but the exact mechanism of how these drugs work is not known.
This is the anti-tumour effect caused by Decitabine. </span><br /><span>However
Decitabine does not act specifically in cancer cells that are heavily
methylated and so the other non-cancer cells will also see some de-methylation. </span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation at CpG islands and overall on
the genome can affect the expression of genes. Areas of DNA repeats are
generally methylated to avoid over-expression of those genes. Altered DNA
methylation, that is methylation at the wrong places could have deleterious
effects of the amount of genes expressed. Sometime this may silence a
tumour-suppressor gene - at other times it may activate an oncogene. Drugs that
alter DNA methylation to either hypomethylate or hypermethylate DNA causes
irreversible altered methylation patterns as these epigenetic patterns are
mitotically inherited. So the effects of these drugs may continue long after
the period of drug treatment. </span><span><br /><span>Early
development and primordial germ cell development are sensitive periods of
epigenetic development. These are the pre-pubescent early teen years, the
months when a couple is trying to get pregnant and the early childhood years.
The epigenetic drugs affect all cells and not just the cancerous ones and are
likely to affect the epigenetic marks on all cells during this sensitive
period. So it is not advisable to treat patients with these drugs during
sensitive periods.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, there is hypo methylation at
the CpG islands. This allows gene expression. DNA methylation is
spread out at inter-genic regions and DNA repeats are methylated to avoid over
expression.</p>

<p><span> In a
cancer cell, the CpG islands and promoter areas are hyper methylated and the
intergenic regions and repeats are hypo methylated. The hyper methylation at
the CpG islands silences the tumour suppressor genes in cancer. This occurs
frequently in tumours. As DNA methylation is mitotically inheritable, this
hyper methylation propagates to the daughter cells and progresses in time. Also
the areas surrounding the CpG islands (upto 2Kbs) called CpG island shores are
also hyper methylated in cancer - and these seem to be an additional indicator
that correlates well with gene expression and identification of cancer cells. </span></p>

<p><span>In contrast with normal cells, there is a
genome wide hypo methylation of intergenic regions and repeats </span>in cancer cells. This leads to instability in the DNA due to
to transposition, translocation, insertions and deletions. Also, hypo
methylation in CpG poor promoter regions leads to oncogene activation. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA hyper methylation or DNA 
hypomethylation at Imprint Control Regions (ICR) can silence the expression of growth
restricting genes (tumour suppressor genes) and the over expression of growth
promoting genes (oncogenes).</p>

<p>In the H19/igf2 cluster, the ICR at the
paternal allele is methylated while the ICR at the maternal allele is not
methylated. This allows CTCF to bind at the ICR on the maternal allele and
inhibit growth factors from acting on Igf2, On the paternal, as the ICR is
methylated, it prevents the binding of CTCF and this results in the growth
factors acting on Igf2 and causes expression of Igf2.</p>

<p><span>In Wilm’s tumour, the ICR is methylated at the paternal
allele and also at the maternal allele due to some epigenetic disruption. This
means that CTCF cannot bind to the ICR at the maternal ICR. So the growth
factors can act on Igf2 and cause its expression. As the ICR is also methylated
at the paternal allele causing Igf2 expression, there is a dosage of Igf2
expression. As Igf2 controls the growth factor, a double dosage of this leads
to uncontrolled growth in the cells.</span></p></div>
