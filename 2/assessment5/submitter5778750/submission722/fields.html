    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value">In cancer patients, we can observe changes in methylation that are specific - with the progression of the disease, the CpG islands tend to get hypermethylated, while the global level of methylation decreases.<br /><br />In normal cells DNA methylation at CpG islands serves for silencing a gene. In cancer the CpG islands tend to be methylated (hypermethylation), thus methylation of the CpG islands of tumour suppressor genes leads to their silencing, which contributes to cancer development. Methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements maintains genomic stability, preventing illegitimate recombination and preventing transposition, respectively. In cancer cells intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be not methylated (hypomethylation), which leads to genomic instability.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Disruptions in imprinting lead to changes in the methylation in imprinting control regions (ICRs) - hypo or hyper - that could lead to overexpression of growth promoting genes, or the underexpression of growth suppressing genes, both of which could lead to abnormal growth.<br /><br />Looking at the <span><em>H19/Igf2</em> cluster we can see that i</span>n the paternal allele the ICR is methylated and CTCF cannot bind to it, so the enhancers can activate the expression of <i>Igf2</i> while <i>H19 </i>is not expressed. In the maternal allele we observe the opposite: the ICR is not methylated, thus CTCF can bind to it and the enahancers will promote the expression of <i>H19</i>, while <i>Igf2 </i>will stay inactive. In Wilm's tumour the maternal ICR is also methylated (hypermethylation), so there is overexpression of <i>Igf2</i>, and <i>H19 </i>is not expressed. Because <i>Igf2 </i>is growth promoting, the overexpression leads to tumours.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine could be used in <span>leukaemia</span> treatment. It is part of the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi), and causes hypomethylation (lowers methylation). Decitabine is a cytidine analog, which it replaces in the DNA strand. When DNMT tries to copy the methylation state to the daughter strand it is bound to the decitabine "base" irreversibly. That mechanism of action mandates replication dependency. The anti-tumour effect could be based on the fact that in cancer patients there is hypermethylation of the tumour suppressor genes (in CpG islands), so by lowering their methylation level, the cancer growth is suppressed.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic threatment could have prolonged effects, because epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable - after the treatment the effects of the drug are transferred to the daughter cells. Thus, the new cells produced by the cancer mass could have different epigenetic state, making them more susceptable to following treatment. Sensitive periods are those, in which there is epigenetic reprogramming - during early development (preimplantation and early implantation - gametes, egg fertilisation, blastocyst) and primordial germ cell develoment in the embryo. Because of the changes in methylation undergoing in those periods it would be inadvasiable to interfere by using drugs, that modify methylation in the cells. This could lead in disruption of epigenetic clearing of the genome, changes in repeat methylation that usually stays high during those periods and also could interfere with imprinting.</div>
