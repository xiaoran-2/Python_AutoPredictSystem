    <div class="field-value">In mammals, CpG islands are usually found in promoters of genes and are unmethylated in normal conditions.  Methylation at this sites is related with gene silencing.  In cancer cells, methylation at CpG islands is high, they're hypermethylated, especially on promoters for tumour suppressor genes. This contribute to cancer because the expression of this tumour suppressor genes is inhibited and this could lead to abnormal replication of the cells due the lack of tumour supression ability.<br /><br />In normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated in order to ensure the genomic stability, because the transcription or expression of these regions could lead to malfunction of the machinery of the cell and contribute to disease. In cancer cells, this DNA regions usually become demethylated an its consequence depends on location. But usually this genome-wide hypomethylation causes genomic instability like deletions, insertions or translocations. Hypomethylation on CpG poor promoters could lead to oncogene activation.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Gene impriting is usually disrupted in cancer, that is the case for the H19/lgf2 cluster, in wich an hypermethylation causes an epigenomic disorder related with Wilm's tumour,.<br />In normal conditions, in the H19/lgf2 cluster, the imprint control region (ICR) is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele.<br />In maternal allele, CTCF can bind to the IRC and the enhancers can act on H19, and expression of H19 leads to lgf2 silencing in this allele. In the paternal allele, methylation of the IRC leads to methylation on H19. It get silenced and enhancers can act on lgf2 gene expresing it. <br /><br />In Wilm's tumour the IRC of the maternal allele is also methylated, this cause a double dose of lgf2 that is growth promoting and contribute with the abnormal behavior in the replications of the cells.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the class of the DNA-demethylating agents, with azacitidine. Are used to tread myelodyplastic syndromes and leukemia. At certain doses, Decitabine demethylates DNA, by binding to DNA methylases before they restablish DNA methylations in the new strand after replication. In cancer cells this have a terapeutical effect because the drug can reactivate expression of silent tumour supression genes and eventually control the tumour growth.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically hereditable. If methylation marks are succesfully removed in one cell, their doughter cells will not exhibit the methylation, and their doughter cells won't either, and so on. This could be good in affected tumour tissues, but in sensitive periods, like development of germ cells or setting of marks in embyonal development, the use of this drugs could disrupt the epigenome in harmful ways. A epigenetic sensitive period, is a lapse of time when the organism is especially sensitive to enviromental signals, and this signals could affect the epigenetic make-up of the cells causing abnormalities or disease.<br />Wouldn't be recommended the use of this kind of drugs during sensitive periods because they can lead to undesirable alterations of the epigenome and produce side effects. (If in germ cells, could lead to imprinting disorders. In embryo development could cause abnormalities in the setting of epigenetic marks). This effects aren't really clear, but scientists should be careful in order to avoid undesirable side effects and exploit the benefical potential of this drugs in the terapeutical aspect for treating cancer.<br /></div>
