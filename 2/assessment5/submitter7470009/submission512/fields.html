    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Specific genes in cancer cells tends to be silenced by having promoter CpG islands  hypermethylated and disrupt the normal transcription function of these genes. normally, these CpG islands are generally hypomethylated and contrary to intergenic regions and repetitive element, which are normally hypermethylated to keep genomic stability and are found to be hypomethylated in cancer cell.  Hypermethylation of CpG may silence tumour suppressor gene and cell death related genes and eventually promote the growth of tumour cells. Unstable repetitive and intergenic will increase jump gene , gene translocation and gene mutation and eventually causing cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In paternal allele, its imprint control region CTCF  is methylated that make the enhancers can act on igf2 and express it. While in maternal alleles, the imprint control region CTCF  is  unmethylated that make the enhancers will act on h19 instead and  leave igf2 silenced without being expressed.  If  paternal and maternal alleles are both have CTCH methylated that will cause both alleles' igf2 gene  being expressed and make overdose of igf2 and resulting in  promoting called Wilm's tumour. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Decitabine is a cytosine nucleoside analog and will inhibit DNA methylation when incorporated into DNA.  This will eventually reactivate silenced genes like p15 and re-establish of normal p15 protein expression.  If some of the reactivated genes are related to tumour suppression or  cell death that will eventually stop the proliferatiion of tumour cell and trigger tumour cell death.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Epigenetic drugs altered the tumour cells by  changing their methylation status of genes and therefore stop their proliferation by reactivate tumour suppressor genes others. All these  may therefore localized the tumour and made them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy. Sensitive period regards to epigenetics is the periods of pre-implantation development and germ cell development.  Genome wide demethylation and remethylation of mammalians mainly occurred in these periods of time. Therefore, any epigenetic treatment in these periods may cause lifelong abnormality of the genetic methylation status and results in unpredictable consequences. </span><br /></div>
