    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value">Methylation at CpG islands located in the promoter region of a gene is usually assosiated with the decrease of expression of this gene. So the genes, which are normally expressed in a cell, are not methylated. If, for instance, a cancer cell overexpresses enzymes involved in DNA methylation, it will lead to increased methylation level og CpG islands in promoters, so these genes will be down-regulated. This lead to imbalance in many cell processes. If a promoter of tumor-supressor gene is methylated, it can lead to tumor growth. <br /> Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated. Hypomethylation at these sites , which occures in many cancer types, leads to genomic instability and sometimes chromosome disruption (deletions, translocations, insertions). Mistakes during chromosome repair can result in promoter attachement to proto-oncogene and lead to cancer developement. Hypomethylation of CpG-poor promoters can also lead to oncogene activation. <br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In case of H19/Igf2 cluster paternal allele is methylated, so H19 is silenced and Igf2 expression is active. On the maternal allele H19 is transcribed, because there is no methylation at CTCF binding site. Igf2 is not expressed from the maternal allele.  In Wilm’s tumour both parental alleles are methylated, which leads to overexpression of Igf2. This disrupted imprinting results in ucontrolled division of cells, because Igf2 is a growth factor.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. It can decrease the methylation level of hypermethylated regions, which is a common phenomena in cancer. If it demethylates a promoter of a tumor-supressor gene, its expression will be reestablished and it will stop the tumor growth.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is heritable - the methylation pattern is conserved in the cell lineage during mitosis. This means, that once the pattern is changed by drug treatement, it will remain in all the progenitor cells will have this pattern. However, there are some periods during human developement, when the epigenetic state is of great importance. Sensitive periods, when most of epigenetic marks are cleared, are: germ cell development and early embryonic development. So it would be  inadvisable to treat pregnant women with any epigenetic drugs in order to avoid unpredictable effects on future generations. The balance in epigenetic regulation during sensitive periods is extremely important.<br /></div>
