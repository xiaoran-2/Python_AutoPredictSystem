    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">If the CpG islands aren't methylated, mostly means that it's a normal cell. If the CpG islands are (partly) methylates, can indicate a cancer cell.<br />The DNA methylation of CpG islands is increasing, so disrupted, during cancer progression. Disruption of DNA methylation -meaning more DNA methylation present of CpG islands- silence the expression of tumor supression genes, so tumor cells can't be supressed anymore. In a normal cell, the CpG island is hypomethylated, and the Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylates. In a cancer cell, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are disrupted because now they are hypomethylated instead of methylated. Because in cancer cell the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated instead of methylated, genes that normally would be suspressed can now be expressed, like cell growth genes. Those genes would now contribute to cancer.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. Because it's a DNA-demethylating agent, Decitabine would inhibit methylation. Genes that would be silenced because they were methylated in cancer state, would now be demethylated so they can express again. This can also mean that tumor supression genes, silenced by cancer, now can be expressed again, helping in fighting the cancer cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The methylation pattern of the paternal allele would be non-methylated when igf2 is in expression status because igf2 can only be expressed on the paternal allele. The methylation pattern of the maternal allele would be methylated when igf2 is in expression status, because the gene on the maternal allele would than be silenced.<br />If imprinting is disrupted, genes on one parental would be silenced that otherwise would be expressed or vice virsa. This can also involve genes that play a role in cancer like tumor supression genes and tumor growth genes.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can lead to changes of gene expression. Genes that first would be expressed can be silenced and vice versa. This can lead to changes in proteins involved in the DNA and histone, which can result in enduring effects on the epigenome because the chromatins structure can change.<br />Sensitive periods are periods were there is a increased epigenetic sensitivity. Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because changes in the epigenome can have larger effects (for better or worse) during these periods. </div>
