    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value">In normal cells, CpG islands are usually unmethylated while repetitive elements and intergenic regions are usually methylated. These methylated state helps maintain genomics stability by maintaining chromosomes structure; and influences the silencing of cryptic promoters or cryptic splice sites that would lead to incomplete transcriptions. Meanwhile, in cancer cells, CpG islands and surrounding genomic material tend to be hypermethylated, causing gene silencing. This gene inactivation can happen to tumor suppressor genes which in turn would cause the proliferation of cancer cells. On the other hand, intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be hypomethyleted. These hypomethylation leads to genomic instability as deletions, insertions or reciprocal translocations could happen between chromosomes; or activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes leading to transcription fails. These genomic abnormalities contributes to an uncontrolled growth of cells that could lead to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In chromosome 11 the H19/Igf2 cluster is paternally imprinted. The maternal allele presents an unmethylated imprinted control region (ICR). An insulator protein, CTFC, bounds to the ICR and acts on Igf2 allowing the enhancers to activate H19. This long non coding RNA acts as a regulator of cell growth, and is only produced by the maternal allele. On the other hand, the paternal allele presents a methylated ICR so CTFC can't bind to this region and enhancers activate Igf2. Paternal H19 is also methylated, so it's expression is silenced. Igf2 acts as a growth stimulator and is normally expressed by the paternal allele. In a normal cell, growth is regulated by the presence of maternal H19 and paternal Igf2. In cancer, imprinting is lost and both copies of ICR are hypermethylated, only Igf2 is expressed from both parental alleles. As you receive a double dose of Igf2, overgrowth is presented as usually kidney tumors in childhood (Wilm's tumor).</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, used to treat myelodysplastic syndrom<span>. As this agent is a nucleoside analog, it can incorporate into DNA upon replication, and when the DNMT1 comes along to bind the copy, that binding is irreversible. Decitabine is division dependent and if used at lower doses, it can cause DNA demethylation. This demethylation could activate tumor suppressor genes that could in turn control cell growth. At the same time, the specificity of this agent or if there are other mechanisms of action aren't clear for the moment. Then again, as cancer cells replicate more, there is a chance that these cells will be more affected by this agent.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Most epigenetic agents tend to be passed through cell division to the daughter cells, this is how they can be maintained even beyond the period of treatment. DNA methylation sometime leads to gene silencing, and as DNMT1 is in charge of maintaining methylation, these silencing can be permanent for CpG islands shores and other genes along the genome. It is also important to realize the presence of sensitive periods. These periods are defined as the stage when the environment may be able to influence the epigenetic makeup. If any kind of drug treatments are held between these periods, there is a chance to inhibit the epigenetic machinery. The first sensitive period is held from primordial germ cell development through the production of mature gametes. While, the second sensitive period is in the early embryonic development (pre-implantation and early post-implantation period). Both periods are of acting remodeling of the epigenome. Any changes done in these stages, specially in early development, can affects directly to the patients offspring and her grand-children (third generation) as the gametes from where they are going to be born are in development.</div>
