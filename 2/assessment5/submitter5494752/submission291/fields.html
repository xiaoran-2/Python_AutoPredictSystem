    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands is the addition of a methyl group on the
cytosine which is exclusively followed by a guanine (CpG dinucleotide). These
CpG islands are found mostly near the promoters of genes and are involved in
silencing gene expression. Normally these CpG islands are kept unmethylated.In cancer cells CpG islands are hypermethylated
causing silencing of the underlying gene.The frequency of methylation of CpG islands
of tumour suppressor gene is very high.Hypermethylation at CpG islands cause
silencing of important genes like tumour suppressor gene and some specific
genes like MLH1, RB, etc which lead to outgrowth of cancer.Methylation of intergenic regions and
repetitive elements maintains the genomic integrity and avoids transcriptional
interference by silencing cryptic transcriptional start sites and silencing the
repeats which prevents transposition, unnecessary recombinationIn normal cells intergenic regions and
repetitive elements are sufficiently methylated and thus silenced. In cancer
cells these regions are hypomethylated.Hypomethylation of repetitive elements and
intergenic regions causes genomic instability. The frequency of deletions,
duplications, reciprocal translocation increases leading to illegitimate
recombinations. DNA hypomethylation enhances tumorigenesis </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The ICR of the paternal allele is methylated. Thus CTCF
cannot bind to the ICR. Due to this the enhancers act on Igf2 and promote its
expression on the paternal allele.ICR on the maternal allele is unmethylated. An insulator
molecule CTCF binds to the ICR on maternal allele diverting the enhancers to
act on H19 gene and promoting its expression rather than Igf2. In Wilm's tumour Igf2 undergoes a loss of imprinting.Loss of imprinting of the Igf2 gene involves aberrant activation of the normally repressed maternally inherited allele, related to biallelic hypermethylation of the H19 differentially methylated region. Igf2 is thus turned expressed from both the alleles, and H19 turned off, causing increased cell growth which may lead to cancer. Some studies suggested a potential tumor suppressor effect of the <i>H19</i> locus. Thust he lack of <i>H19</i> expression leads to larger tumors.</p><p></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a hypomethylation agent. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. It is used to treat <span>myelodysplastic syndrome. Hypermethylation causes blockage of the activity of tumour suppressor genes. Decitabine acts as a demethylating agent.<br /></span><span> By this process of demethylation, normal function to the tumor suppressor genes is restored, thus restoring control over cell growth.</span><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation has overall effect on the epigenome. DNA methylation is one of the main factors which causes expression or silencing of a gene. Altering this can have enduring effects as the genes expressed change. Sensitive period is that period when the environmental changes can affect epigenetic programming. These sensitive periods are from the developmental of primordial germ cells to actual production of mature sperm and egg, and the second period is the preimplantation and early post implantation period. By giving epigenetic drugs we alter or inhibit DNA methylation and all the epigenetic machinery. It is inadvisable to give these drugs to patients in their sensitive period because their epigenetic machinery is already very unstable and undergoing reprogramming and by giving these drugs we may permenantly damage the epigenome. </div>
