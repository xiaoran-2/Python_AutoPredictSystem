    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>
As
with all imprinted clusters, H19 and lgf2 expression is regulated by
Imprint Control Region (ICR) located between genes. Correct
imprinting H19 and Igf2 requires ICR methylated on the paternal
allele unmethylated on the maternal allele. Oppositely
imprinted genes H19 and lgf2
coordinately regulated through competition for access to their
promoters common enhancer. 
Enchancer
activates transcription
of the gene H19 on
the maternal chromosome, which
is read from noncoding
RNA while
lgf2
gene is inactive. On the
father
chromosome, as a result of methylation of
H19,
gene lgf2
locus becomes available to the enhancer and activates. Thereby,
in normal cells, the paternal lgf2 and maternal H19 are expressed.
In Wilms' tumor the
maternal chromosome reverses to a paternal epigenotype, with a
paternal pattern of methylation at
ICR (hypermethylation
of ICR). This
means
biallelic
expression
of lgf2 and
silencing of H19<span>.
Overexpression of lgf2 shows properties as an oncogene.</span><span></span><span> </span>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In
a normal cell the genome is methylated mainly in the repetitive
elements, intergenic regions and even in the introns of genes.
Exceptions to this are the global unmethylation of CpG islands
representing area of high CpG density found near gene promoters. In
contrast, in cancer cells, CpG
islands are more likely to be methylated and
the rest of the genome,  including the repetitive elements,
intergenic elements and introns is
hypomethylated.</p><p>Since
CpG islands are located in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes,
their local hypermethylation leads to inherited silencing of
the genes
which would,
if unsilenced, inhibit
the development of cancer. 
</p><p>
	
	
	





</p><p>Hypomethylation
of repeats or intergenic intervals leads to genomic instability. The
consequence of this is
an
illegitimate recombination between
repeats that
occurs
because they are not densely packaged down into heterochromatin.
Repeats can also be activated because of the hypomethylation. This
means that they have the capacity to actually make a copy of
themselves and jump around the genome or transpose. This can result
in consequent problems in
the locations where
they jump into, because they may disrupt the coding region of a gene
and
possibly
activate neighboring genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>
<span>DNA
is methylated by DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) that
maintains methylation pattern by copying it from parent to daughter
DNA strands after replication.
Aberrant methylation  of the promoters of genes is potentially
revesible. The
silencing of tumor suppressor genes is closely associated with DNA
hypermethylation in cancer cells. Decitabine is an analog of
cytosine nucleoside, which selectively inhibits DNMT activity, which
leads to hypomethylation of the promoters of tumor suppressor genes.
Decitabine, DNMT inhibitor, get
incorporated
into DNA during
replication and then are recognized by DNMT enzymes.
Thus, DNMT is trapped, which makes it impossible to do
its function and enzyme degrades. As this process is
division-dependent, the cancer cells, which divide more rapidly, are
more affected than normal cells during the course of treatment.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.

    <div class="field-value"><p>
<span>Altering
DNA methylation can significantly change the level of gene
expression. Epigenetic changes are passed during cell division to
daughter cells. During
development of a new organism, there are sensitive
periods when the environment influences
our epigenotype more severely than
normally. In these periods particular
cell types or organs are developing and establishing their epigenetic
marks. Sensitive periods of development include germ cell development
and early embryonic development, birth, infancy and puberty. For
example, the brain is actively developing in infancy, and therefore
this period is a sensitive period for the brain. During
these periods using methylation-altering
drugs
disrupts<span>
the natural formation of the epigenome, ie the formation of new cells
that determines the development of a new, unusual direction, leading
to the development of anomalies, defects and deformities.</span></span></p></div>
