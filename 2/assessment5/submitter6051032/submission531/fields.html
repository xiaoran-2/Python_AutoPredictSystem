    <div class="field-value"><p><span> </span></p><p><span>  In order to
describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer, we must first make a
comparison with the normal function of CpG islands. In general,
methylation doesn't tend to occur at CpG islands, however, when this
occurs is generally signal of silencing of gene expression. So, DNA
methylation is an inactive epigenetic mark. But, DNA methylation can
be found elsewhere in genes and assume different function, for example, at
intergenic intervals and their repetitive elements, where they tend to
be methylated, the function is to do some silencing
of expression and also to maintain genomic integrity and
stability.</span></p><p>




















</p><p><span>    On the other hand, in the case of cancer, a normal frame inversion
occurs.  What happens is, these intergenic intervals and their
repetitive elements now tend to be unmethylated, causing genomic
instability, which is directly associated with cancer.  And also,
areas that shouldn't be methylated, like CpG islands, appears to be
hypermethylated. And, when this methylations shows up in
the promoters of tumor suppressor genes, it is able to
inactivate them, which also can leads to cancer.</span><i></i></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>  </p><p> First, we need to understand the mechanism and the
normal pattern of paternal and maternal imprinting. Using the H19/Igf2 cluster
as an example. Normally, the imprinting control region in is methylated on
the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele, the last one is
binded to the transcriptional depressor CTCF in its insulator
element, which means that, the enhancers will act on H19 and maternal
allele will be expressed. However, the Igf2 will be silented for the
maternal allele and doesn't show expression. When the paternal allele is methylated,
the enhancers can act on Igf2, because CTCF is not binded to inhibit it
and Igf2 is expressed from the paternal allele. </p><p>




















</p><p><span>  In contrast, in the case of cancer, cells displays loss
of imprinting. So, with loss of imprinting, you have
hypermethylation of the imprinting control region on the maternal
allele and it also has the expression of Igf2. With this double dose of
the Igf2, both growth promoting are expressed, and this can leads to</span> embryonic or childhood tumor called Wilm's tumor, which is a malignante
tumor that affects kidney genome and contains metanephric, stromal and
epithelial derivatives.</p><p><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p><p>The
Decitabine belongs to DNMT1 class of epigenetic inhibitors, which means is a
nucleoside analog. What happens is, cells in the presence of
Decitabine incorporates it into DNA during replication
and RNA during transcription. The incorporation of Decitabine
into DNA or RNA binds to nucleotide, and for
consequence, inhibits methyltransferase thereby causing demethylation in that
sequence and copying the methylation to the daughter strand.   <br /></p><p><span>That DNA methyltransferase is bound irreversibly and loses the ability to
be released. And this means that the action of these DNA methyltransferase
inhibitors is division dependent so you have to have the cell replicating, that
is why it can be used in cancer treatment, because the cancer cells
are dividing much more rapidly than most other cells in the body, so them
will be more affected by the anti-tumor treatment. </span></p><p><span><br /></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>

					<p>  The treatment effects of DNA methylation are maintained because, DNA methylation will persist from one cell division to
the next and is inherited through mitosis. So, even if the treatment has finished, the changes in the epigenome will continue there.</p><p>  However, patients with cancer shouldn't be treated in sensitive periods, which means, periods of active remodelling of the epigenome when with active reprogramming and removal of epigenetic marks at different places in the genome. For example, primordial germ cell development all the way through to the production of matute eggs and sperm and also, the pre-implantation period and early post-implantation period. Because, as was mentioned earlier, methylation is mitotically inherited and can be passed to the next generations by germ cells or in the case of pregnancy, for the embryo. So, the child can be epigenetically altered, leading to many problems, as modified gene expression and so on.</p>
