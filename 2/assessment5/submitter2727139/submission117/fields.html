    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprinting is frequently associated with genes involved in growth regulation.  Consequently, disruptions in normal imprinting patterns can result in unregulated growth - a hallmark of cancer.<br />The imprint control region (ICR) within the  H19/Igf2 cluster of the maternal allele is unmethylated.  In this state the insulator protein CTCF binds to the ICR, which blocks activation of the IGF2 gene by downstream enhancers.<br />On the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated.  CTCF cannot bind to the ICR in the methylated state.  In this case, the downstream enhancers promote expression of IGF2.<br />Since IGF2 is a growth promoter, overexpression can lead to cancer, in this case Wilm's tumour is a characteristic cancer.  IGF2 overexpression can occur in a couple of ways, to include mutations/deletions which affect normal imprinting, paternal uniparental disomy (two copies of the fathers allele) and epigenetic disruption for loss of imprinting.  <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normally, CpG islands, which are frequently promoters of tumor suppressor genes, are hypomethylated, in which state the associated gene is transcribable.  In cancerous cells, the CpG islands are more likely to be methylated, which suppresses transcription of associated genes - most problematic when these genes are tumor suppressors - and similar to the consequence of knockout of the tumor suppressor gene due to genetic mutation.  This altered methylation pattern is mitotically heritable, so a critical control of cell proliferation is lost (again, similar to the consequence of a genetically disabled gene).  Indeed the loss of this control, along with other concurrent genetic or epigenetic insults, gives the cancerous cells a competitive advantage over the neighboring normal cells.<br />Intergenic regions are normally highly methylated.  Methylation of these regions is associated with genetic stability (eg. silencing of transposable elements which can disrupt normal expression of local genes).  In the large majority of cancers, these regions are observed to be relatively hypomethylated, with consequent loss of stability that can result in unregulated cell growth due to down-regulation of tumor suppressing genes or up-regulation of oncogenes.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a demethylating agent.  Hypermethylation of some regions of the genome (eg. CpG islands) is characteristic of many cancers.  In the hypermethylated state the genes controlled by the CpG islands may be silenced.  When these genes are tumor supressor genes, their activity in preventing unregulated cell growth - cancer - is suppressed.  As a demethylating agent, Decitabine can remove some of the hypermethylation, allowing the tumor suppressing genes to be expressed.  It's not mentioned in the Economist article, but it's likely that decitabine could demethylate intergenic regions of the genome also, which would destabilize the genome.  Also, there's the possibility of hypomethylation of CpG islands that control oncogenes.  I guess the greatest hazard in for the cancer patient is their current disease.  The risk of demethylation of intergenic regions and future genetic instability, or activation of oncogenes, is acceptable if the current cancer is controlled.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation constitutes a form of 'epigenetic marks' which regulate the expression of genes.  As is required in the case of differentiation of cell types during the development of an organism, the state of DNA methylation must be preserved during mitosis - the methylation pattern endures in the epigenome of descendent cells (eg. liver cells and their descendents must remain liver cells).  <br />There are two sensitive periods - during early development of the organism (from conception through, I would argue, puberty) and when the organism is developing the next generation of germ cells.  In the former instance, cells in the developing organism are establishing the epigenetic marks which will differentiate the cells of various tissues in the body.  In the latter case, germ cells are being reprogrammed as totipotent cells through removal of epigenetic marks and being programmed as required for appropriate imprinting of certain genes.  Since the programming described in the former and latter case include DNA methylation patterns, treatment of patients with drugs that alter or interfere with methylation can alter the outcome of these developmental periods.<br /></div>
