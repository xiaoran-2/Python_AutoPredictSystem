    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><div>CpG islands are not normally methylated. In cancer they are hypermethylated (they have much more methylation than normal) and as they are generally found in gene promoters, the function of the underlying genes is then silenced. This contributes to cancer by silencing tumour suppressor genes which normally control cell growth, and prevent them from becoming 'immortal' and replicating uncontrollably. </div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>DNA in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is usually methylated, and remains methylated even during the sensitive periods when epigenetic reprogramming takes place such as gametogenesis and early embryo development. The methylation may help to regulate how much transcription takes place and prevent recombination during mitosis and so promote genomic stability. In cancer, these areas become hypomethylated genome-wide, so this methylation which is found there in normal function is removed. This leads to genomic instability, which contributes to genetic mutations which contribute to the cancer. </div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div><br /></div><div>In the H19/lgf2 cluster the paternal allele is normally methylated at the imprint control region. This prevents the insulator protein CTCF from binding. Without this, DNA methylation spreads to the H19 promoter, so H19 is deactivated. The downstream enhancers, which would otherwise be blocked by the CTCF, are able to access the Igf2 locus and Igf2 is expressed from the paternal allele. </div><div><br /></div><div>The ICR is not methylated on the maternal allele, so the enhancers are blocked from acting on the  Igf2 locus, and act on H19 instead. H19 is expressed from the maternal allele and lgf2 is not. </div><div><br /></div><div>In Wilm's tumour the ICR of the maternal allele is hypermethylated so it acts like the paternal allele and expresses Igf2 rather than H19. The loss of imprinting means that we end up with twice as much as Igf2 as we should have.  Igf2 is a growth factor, so this upregulation contributes to cancer by promoting tumour growth. </div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent. It inhibits methylation by preventing the action of DNA methyltransferase so the genome becomes hypomethylated (with much lower levels of methylation than normal). It can have an anti-tumour effect by preventing the hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes, so these genes can prevent the uncontrolled replication of cancer cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div><div>DNA methylation is heritable during mitosis, so once methylation is laid down it is replicable with each cell division. This means that it is only reset during select sensitive periods, during which most methylation is removed and then readded by DNA methyltransferase. The two periods where this happens are during gametogenesis (when the eggs and sperm start to be formed in a developing embryo)  and during the first few days of development after fertilisation. These are sensitive periods because environmental influences during this time may affect how the genome is methylated. Treating patients during sensitive periods (for example treating a pregnant woman during the first few days of her pregnancy) would be inadvisable because the drugs which had an effect on the methylation in the cancer would be likely to also have an effect on the overall methylation of the developing embryo. The child could then end up with disorders due to hypo or hyper methylation, and this could even affect the third generation if the treatment took place during gametogenesis and the drug had an effect on the methylation of these gametes. </div></div></div>
