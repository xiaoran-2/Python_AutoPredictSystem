    <h1>Submission 539 from Anon (session_user_id: 8decdb97f3c49d345d103ab16d983ab944f09342)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. By inhibiting DNA methyltransferase, Decitabine action will result in DNA hypomethylation. While there is gobal hypomethylation in cancer cells, there is methylation of tumuor suppressor genes silencing their activity. Decitabine by preventing methylation may prevent suppression of tumuor suppressor genes, hence showing anti-tumour effect.   </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">in normal cells, CpG island methylation controls the expression of genes. When methylated gene are silenced and vice versa. In cancer, while there is global demethylation of 5mC, there hypermethylation of CpG islands and shores that wii result in genome instability as suppression of tumour supressing and growth arresting genes. Besides effects on single genes, this methylation also effects sets of genes resulting in long stretches of the DNA being silenced and altering the nuclear chromatin arrangement. <br /><br />The methylation of the intergenic regions and repetivtive elements seen in normal cells can be absent in cancer cells allowing the expression of these genes and have long range activation. In addition there will transcription of non-conding RNA such as piRNA and long ncRNA. The long ncRNA due to their secondary structure can act as scaffolds for binding of enzymes involved in either putting or removing epigentic marks both on the DNA and histone tails.  </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">in paternal H19/Igf2 cluster, the H19 promotor region and insulator of Igf2 gene are methylated. This prevents the CTCF from binding to the insulator region allowing the enhancers to promote the expression of the paternal Igf2 gene. in the maternal H19/Igf2 cluster, the imprinting marks are not present, i.e. no methylation of the insulator or H19 promotor. This allows the binding of CTCF to the maternal insulator preventing the enhancers from activating the Igf2 gene. Instead the H19 gene is expressed. In Wilm's tumour, a kidney disease, the maternal H19 promotor region is methylated as well as the insulator of Igf2. Now CTCF cannot bind to the insulator region allowing the enhancers to promote expression of the Igf2 gene. This will result in a double dose of Igf2 as both paternal and maternal Igf2 is expressed and no expression of the maternal H19 gene. This double dose of growth promoting Igf2 gene product is believed to the involved in the cancer progression of Wilm's tumour.  </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation pattern is passed through to daughter cells by the action of DNMT1 which methylates the unmethylated cytosine pairing in the daughter cells. The sensitive period is when epigenetic changes are taking place, e.g. DNA demethylation  and methylation or histone modification. The 2 sensitive periods during development are (1) after fertilization where is hypomethylation of the paternal and maternal DNA followed by re-methylation and resetting of epigenetic marks and (2) during the stage in embryonic development of the gametes, i.e. germ cell line development.  Treatment by drugs that effect the epigenetic machinery during the sensitive period is not advisable as this will interfere with and cause errors in the epigenetic marking process which will effect the cell phenotype and have other undesirable side effects.   </div>
