    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at CpG islands is usually a silencing epigenetic mark. Cancer cells can show both hypermethylation and hypomethylation at CpG islands. Hypermethylation can result in the silencing of tumour suppressor genes, whereas hypomethylation can activate oncogenes.<br />In normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be heavily methylated. The loss of these methyl groups can lead to illegitimate recombination to occur. It can also cause multiple genomic aberrations such as translocations, duplications, deletions, gene disruptions...<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the maternal allele, the H19 imprinting control region (ICR) is not methylated, so CTCF can bind this region activating H19 expression and restricting enhancer access to Igf2. <br />In the paternal allele the H19 ICR is methylated so CTCF cannot bind and the enhancer can interact with the Igf2 promoter and activate its expression. <br />H19 is thought to be a tumour suppressor and Igf2 an oncogen. A majority of Wilm's tumours show a bipaternal epigenotype at these loci, with H19 inactive and Igf2 biallelically active. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, this kind of drug reduces the number of DNA methylation marks. It could have an anti-tumour effect by removing methyl groups at a tumour suppressor gene's promoter and thus activating it.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation can be inherited mitotically, that is why epigenetic changes can have enduring effects. Sensitive periods refer to development stages in which epigenetic marks are established and therefore are very sensitive to these drugs. Early development and puberty are very sensitive periods. Treating patients during germ cells formation can lead to serious consecuencies in their offspring, that is why it would be inadvisable.<br /></div>
