    <h1>Submission 366 from Anon (session_user_id: a61f68e2920b9cb0e26239bdbaa1486aeabbdea7)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor class of epigenetic inhibitor. Decibitabine is a nucleoside analogue and binds irreversibly to DNA methyltranferase  enzyme it thus causes DNA demethylation. Thus Decitabine can act on restoring the function of tumour suppresor genes which have been silence due to abnormal hypermethylation seen in cancer. Thus in haematological malignancies where hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes is the mechanism for neoplastic effects. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>CpG islands are mostly located near promoter regions of genes. Under normal circumstances they tend to be unmethylated but when methylated it silences the genes by either binding to the methylated CpG binding site (primary mechanism) or prevvention of transcription factor binding (secondary.) . Random X inactivation is due to methylation of the CpG islands of one of the X chromosomes.</div><div>The CpG islands in promoters are usually unmethylated irrespective of their activity state. In cancer cells  these are  hypermethylated thus silencing these genes resulting in silencing of tumour supressor genes and hence loss of control on cell cycyle, apoptosos and/or DNA repair. This mechanism is particularly seen in action in haematological maligancies. </div><div>In intergenic regions and repetitive elements regions DNA methylation is seen . DNA methylation at these regions helps in maintaining genomic stability by preventing transposition , silencing of repeats to prevent transcriptional interference from strong promoters and prevent illegetimate recombination.In cancers this genomic stability is disturbed due to hypomethylation at intergenic elements and repetitive elements .This hypomethylation of repeats or intergenic regions results inillegetimate recombination between them,activation of repeats and transposition elements and activation of cryptic promotiers resulting in disruption to neighbouring genes.</div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The H19/Igf2 cluster from upstream to downstream consists of Igf2 , CTCF binding region , H19 and enhancers. <br />In paternal alleles the CTCF binding site as well as the H19 are methylated resulting in non-attachment of CTCF and non-transcription of the lncRNA of H19 region thus allowing the enhancers to directly up-regulate the action of igf2 <br />In maternal allele the CTCF binding site and the H19 sites are unmethylated. Thus the CTCF binds to the site and prevents the enhancers to up-regulate Igf2. Instead the enhancers act on H19 resulting in production of its product lncRnA.  <br /><br />H19/Igf2 cluster regulation might be lost due due to mutation or deletion resulting in loss of imprinting or uniparental disomy . When both alleles act like a paternal allele i,e both alleles are hypermethylated at CTCF region resulting in over expression of Igf gene resulting in unregulated growth and thus causing cancer.  This loss of imprinting and activation of oncogenes results in cancer . Similar mechanism is seen in Wilms tumour too. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Epigenetic DNA methylation is transmittiable mitotically . This is due to the presence of a maintainence methyltransferase enzyme called DNMT1which can recognise the hemi-methylated DNA in daugheter cells and methylated them. However during gametogenesis and during early embryogenic development such epigenetic marks are reset and these are known as sensitive periods . Any abornarmility or change durign these phases thus causes epigenetic changes with consequences for the rest of the life (if inteference in early embryonic phase) or to the next progeny (for epigentic disruption durign gametogenesis). It is thus advised that epigenetic drugs are not given in these sensitive periods when it affects germ cells and might thus dysregulate the entire epigenome resulting in genomic instability.<br /></div></div>
