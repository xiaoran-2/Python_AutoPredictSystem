    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation at CpG islands is essential for
genomic integrity. Most of the genes have hypomethylated CpG islands at their
promoters, regardless if the gene is active or not. A disruption of DNA
methylation can occur through mutations in epigenetic enzymes which are rapidly
selected during the life time of the individual. In cancer cells the genes encoding
tumor suppressors have hypermathylated CpG islands, thus they are silenced and the
cell will became a cancer cell. Until DNA methylation is removed, the mark will be mitotically heritable, so the daughter
cells will also be cancer cells. Also the removal of DNA methylation can lead
to genomic instability because of instertions of repetitive elements all over
the genome. </span></p>

<p><span>DNA methylation at intergenic regions and
repetitive elements is as well  important for maintaining genomic intergrity,
because these regions constitute most of the genome. Otherwise the genome can be altered
by deletions, insertions, dublecations, transpositions etc.  In cancer cells the  intergenic regions and repetitive elements are
hypomethylated. Thus, the genome is altered by recombinations between repeats,
transpositions of repeats that may lead to disruption of other genes, and
activation of cryptic promoters, whom genes used to be silent. As a result the
chances of the cell to become cancer cell are increased.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation of the  imprinted control region (ICR) of an imprinted gene, does not necessarily mean gene silencing. The paternal allele has its ICR  methylated, and  CTCF protein cannot bind. This protein
insulates the <i>Igf2</i> gene which is upstream,
from  downstream enhancers. So with the insulator not binded, the enhancers
act on Igf2 which is expressed from the paternal allele. The maternal allele has its ICR unmethylated, so the insulating
protein can bind and the enhancers are not acting on <i>Igf2</i> but on<i> H19</i>. Thus <i>Igf2</i> is not expressed, but  <i>H19</i> is
expressed.</p>

<p><span>This imprinting pattern is altered with
hypermethylation of ICR of the maternal allele. As a result the insulator
protein can not bind and the enhancers promote the expression of the <i>Igf2</i> from the maternal allele. So now
there is double the amount of <em>Igf2</em> product in the cell, which is oncogene associated
with Wilm’s tumor. </span>The dosage of a growth promoter in a cell, is
important for the survival of the cell. In the case of double dosage of such gene,
the cell will be more likely to be developed to a tumor, because of it’s
enhanced growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA demethylation agent which removes
the already laid down methylation.The tumor cells most likely have hypermethylated CpG islands, encoding tumor suppressing genes. By introducing
DNA methylation agents in the appropriate dosage, the hypermethylated CpG
islands will become unmethylated and the the suppressing tumor genes will be
expressed. In addition when that epigenetic mark is removed it cannot be obtained
again,and daughter the cells will stop be oncogenic.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation has
similar effect with a genetic mutation in gene silencing, but it can be reversed,
and when reversed, it can be mitotically inherited to the
daughter cells. Thus, altering an hypermethylated state of DNA or indeed an hypomethylated state will help to get closer to the methylation pattern of normal cell.</span><br /></p><p><span>In the life time of
an individual there are 2 sensitive periods where environmental influences can
alter the epigenetic control. The first is </span>in early development in the
pre-implantaion period,
and the second is in primordial germ cell development. The
second is the one that can be influenced from a drug that alters DNA
methylation, in a younger patient. To treat patient in these periods means that
the epigenetic reprogramming will be disrupted, and as a result DNA methylation
of imprinted genes and repetitive elements, will not occur as it would normally
do. The disorders and syndromes that can be come forth of such disruption, are
severe and they will influence the
generations to come, because when an epigenetic mark is established it is
heritable until the mark is actively erased.</p></div>
