    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation plays an important role
in genome regulation. Depending on its position, it can alter gene
expression or give rise to truncated versions of genes. One of the
hallmarks of cancer is a change in methylation pattern. Regions that
are normally methylated lose their methylation and vice versa. In
humans 70-80% of the CpG cytosines are methylated. CpG islands on the
other hand tend to not be methylated. The CpG islands can usually be
found near transcription start sites and if they are methylated the
genes' transcription may be inhibited. If the affected gene is
involved in DNA repair machinery or cell maintenance, a loss of
function can contribute to cancer process.

<p>Non-coding parts of the genome are
typically methylated to suppress interaction. These include
repetitive stretches, intergenic regions, and even introns. This
could lead to either denser compacting of the chromatin or a
prevention of specific proteins from binding. If the methylation
pattern is lost due to cancer interference, normally silenced regions
can become activated and this could have disastrous consequences.
Change in intergenic regions can affect gene expression levels.
Repetitive regions have a tendency to cross over to other chromosomes
due to sequence similarity. These crossovers can cut genes in half
resulting in a complete loss of function.</p>

<p>Since epigenetic patterns are inherited
mitotically there is strong selective pressure for cancer cells with
epigenetic changes that drives the cancer growth and spread.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Genomic imprinting, in the form of DNA
methylation, is dependent on the parent of origin. A good example is
the H19/IGF2 cluster which has an important role in fetal growth.<br /><br />In the maternal allele there is an
unmethylated binding site for an insulator protein called CTCF. It
will isolate the IGF2 gene from downstream enhancers. Instead of
acting upon IFG2, the enhancers will promote the expression of a long
noncoding RNA called H19.
<p>The CTCF binding site on the parental
allele is methylated preventing interaction. The methylation can also
spread to the neighboring H19 transcription start site preventing it
too from being expressed. With no insulator the downstream enhancers
are free to act on the IGF2 gene.
</p><p>If the methylation pattern is disrupted
it's possible to have two active IGF2 genes at the same time (or two
H19). The increase in gene expression is likely to cause an abnormal
increase in growth.
</p><p>There is a syndrome called Beckwith
Wiedemann where the maternal allele behaves like the paternal allele.
This could be caused by either mutations or epigenetic disruption.
The disease is also affected by changes to the expression of the
CDKN1C tumor suppressor gene located upstream of the H19/IGF2
cluster.

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p style="margin-bottom:0in;">One of the drugs covered by the
Economist's article “Cancer's epicentre” is Decitabine. It's a
DNA-demethylating agent that acts by inhibitating DNA
methyltransferase. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0in;">By preventing methylation the drug can
reduce gene silencing caused by epigenetic disruption of CpG islands.
Since the drug is unspecific it has many serious side effects. In low
doses it will primarily cause hypomethylation of DNA. At higher doses
it is directly cytotoxic. 

</p><p style="margin-bottom:0in;">Against cancer it is the potency to
reactivate silenced tumor suppressor genes that is the most desired
action. Triggering apoptosis could be another desired outcome.
However, one should not forget the risks of causing new epimutations
by disturbing constitutionally hypermethylated regions.

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering the epigenome can have
long-lasting effects. A change in relative gene expression levels or
reactivation of inactivated genes could complete change cancer
behavior. There are many ways to influence epigenetic configurations
although the one scientists are most familiar with is DNA
methylation. 

<br /><br />Periods when the epigenome is
reprogrammed are especially sensitive. Early embryonic and primordial
germ cell development are critical for humans. During these periods
the methylation pattern is first reset and then restored to a normal
state that is essential for continued growth and advancement. 

<p>In an adult it is easier to target
specific sections of exposed euchromatin. It is also possible to
target differentiated cells instead of pluripotent stemcells. 





	
	
	
	Since changes are inherited mitotically
it is inadvisable to disrupt cells at an early stage of life.</p></div>
