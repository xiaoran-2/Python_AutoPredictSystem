    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation plays an important role as a regulator of
transcription and in the development of cancer. 
CpG islands are the location of the most common promoter type in mammals,
and under normal circumstances these regions are hypomethylated.  Abberrant DNA methylation is associated with
alterations of gene expression and can result in cancer. For example, hypermethylation
of  these CpG island regions is
associated with silencing of genes including tumor supressor genes, and
subsequent promotion of cancer. </span></p>

<p><span>DNA methylation also plays a role in silencing intergenic
regions and repetitive elements, both of which are genetically unstable unless
actively silenced. These regions, when active, can jump around in the genome
and insert themselves into gene regions altering their expression and possibly silence
tumor supressor genes or activate oncogenes- either of these scenarios contribute
to cancer development.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Disruption of imprinting can result in cancer. For example,
in the H19/Igf2 gene cluster, DNA methylation of the paternal ICF (imprint
control region) silences H19, while enhancers promote the expression of
Igf2.  <span>On the maternal allele, the ICF is
not methylated which allows CTCP to bind upstream, the enhancers promote the
expression of H19 and Igf2 is silenced. In Wilm's tumor, there is a disruption of
imprinting at this cluster in which both alleles are methylated, which in turn
silences H19 and promotes expression of two copies of the Igf2 locus. It is
this overexpression of Igf2 locus that results in cancer. </span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p></p><p>
</p><span></span><p>

</p><p><span>Abberant gene expression- either underexpression of tumor
supressor genes or overexpression of oncogenes- is associated with the
development of cancer. Decitabine, an enzymatic epigenetic regulator is used as
a drug to treat some forms of cancer. It is a DNA methyltransferase
inhibitor, and it acts by blocking methyltransferase, one enzyme involved
in the laying down of methyl groups onto the DNA. This drug results in a
decrease in DNA methylation and reactivates the expression of these tumor
supressor genes, and consequently has an anti-tumor effect.</span></p><p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation can have long lasting effects on the
epigenome because these epi-marks are mitotically heritable.  These marks serve as an additional set (beyond
the DNA itself) of instructions to the cell as to whether a
region of the genome should be actively expressed or transcriptionally silent.  There are several groups of methyltransferases
which lay down methyl groups onto the DNA or histones each time the DNA is
replicated, which accounts for how these epi-marks are passed on to the
daughter cells. This mitotic heritability is critical to consider when planning
the use of chemotherapy drugs in cancer patients as disruption to the epigenome
may be detrimental. </span></p>

<p><span>There are "senstive periods" during development in
which environmental effects may result in epigenetic changes that persist
throughout the lifespan of the organism. 
These sensitive periods include gametogenesis and early embryogenesis-
both are periods in which these epigenetic marks are being established as way
to direct cells to differentiate into specific tissues. Thus, it is possible
that chemotherapy drugs, which act to alter the epigenetic landscape, can also
have effects which last beyond the course of treatment. Because these epigenetic
marks are heritable for the lifetime of the organism, it is not advisable to treat
patients with drugs which could alter the establishment of these epi-marks in a
long-term and adverse way. <span> </span></span></p></div>
