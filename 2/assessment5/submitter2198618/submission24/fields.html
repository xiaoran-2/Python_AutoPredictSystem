    <div class="field-value">   In normal cells, CpG islands are often found in the promoter regions of genes. These islands are mostly unmethylated, thus allowing expression of the associated genes. Methylation of the islands is a repressive mark and silences the genes.<br />   In cancer, there is hypermethylation of the CpG islands in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes. This results in silencing of the tumor suppressor genes. This methylation can be the 'second hit' in Knudson hypothesis and promote the growth or survival of the cell. Since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, it is a very effective way of silencing the gene. The competitive advantage conferred on the cell can be rapidly selected for and contributes to cancer.<br />   Repetitive elements in the genome have the capacity to make a copy of themselves, jump around the genome or transpose. They can also cause illegitimate recombination with other chromosomes. All these effects result in genomic instability resulting in deletions, insertions or reciprocal translocations. In normal cells, the repeats are heavily methylated and hence heterchromatinized. This inactivates the repeats and prevent illegitimate recombination. In cancer, the repeats are hypomethylated resulting in genomic instability.<br />   In the intergenic regions, there are CpG poor promoters and some of them are associated with potent oncogenes like R-Ras. In normal cells, these CpG poor promoters are methylated, hence silencing the oncogenes. In cancer, these CpG poor promoters become hypomethylated and, the associated oncogenes are activated. An example is seen with gastric cancer and activation of R-RAS oncogene.<br />   There are imprint control regions in the intergenic regions of the normal cells. The DNA methylation pattern and the effects are locus dependent. In the H19/IGF2 cluster, only the paternal allele is normally methylated and expressed. In cancer, both alleles are methylated and IGF2 in both alleles are expressed resulting in growth promotion</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">   H19/Igf2 cluster of genes are located on Chromosome 11. Igf2 codes for Igf2 protein, a growth promoter. Downstream of the Igf2 is the imprint control region (ICR). When it is unmethylated, an insulator protein, CTCF can bind to it and shields the Igf2. Further downstream are the H19 gene which codes for a long noncoding RNA, which acts on enhancers further downstream.<br />   H19/Igf2 is paternally imprinted, ie the ICR on the paternal allele is methylated. When the ICR is methylated, CTCF cannot bind to it.  Hence, there is no CTCF to shield Igf2 from the enhancers downstream. The enhancers can then activate the Igf2 and promote its expression.<br />   In the maternal allele, the ICR is not methylated. CTCF can then bind to it and insulate the Igf2 from the actions of the downstream enhancers. The Igf2 on the maternal allele is therefore, not expressed. Instead, the enhancers act on H19 and enhances its expression.<br />   In Wilm's tumor, there is a loss of imprinting ie the maternal allele is also methylated. CTCF cannot bind to its ICR and hence this allows the downstream enhancers to activate the Igf2 gene. There is now a double dose of Igf2 resulting in growth promotion</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">   Decitabine has been approved by FDA for the treatment of Myelodysplastic Syndrome progressing to Acute Myeloid Leukemia. It is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. It is a nucleoside analogue and gets incorporated into the DNA upon replication. When the DNMT1 comes to bind it and copy the methylation to the daughter strand, the DNMT1 is bound irreversibly and can no longer be released.  This results in cell death. This action is division dependent. As cancer cells are dividing more rapidly, they will be more severely affected.<br />  The end result is global DNA demethylation. Hypermethylation of CpG islands associated with tumor suppressor genes is very common. Demethylation of these CpG islands by decitabine can result in reactivation of the tumor suppressor genes and halt the growh of the cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">  Epigenetic therapy is non-specific ie the drugs affect the entire epigenome in the body. They cause global demethylation, not just at the specific target of interest.  Hence, there may be unintended consequences with regard to gene expression, and may induce tumorigenesis by activation of oncogenes, induction of chromosomal instability, and mutagenesis. Epigenetic marks like DNA methylation/demethylation are mitotically heritable ie they can be passed on to the daughter cells during mitosis.  Hence, the effects of drugs that target epigenetic modifiers can have long lasting effects, long after the period of drug exposure. <br />   There are sensitive periods in the life cycle when the epigenome are especially vulnerable to change.  These are periods when there are extensive reprogramming and changes to the epigenome namely, germ cell development, early fetal development prior to implantation and during differentiation of specialised cells eg blood stem cells differentiating into T cells. Any interference with these processes of reprogramming and remodelling of the epigenetic marks may have unforeseen long term consequence. These drugs therefore should be used with caution in young patients and pregnant patients.</div>
