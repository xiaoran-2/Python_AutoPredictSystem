    <div class="field-value">In normal cells CpG islands are typically not methylated thereby the associated genes are expressed. However in cancer cells CpG islands tend to be methylated, thereby inhibiting the expression of the gene, which is often a tumour suppressor gene. Silencing of tumour suppressing genes facilitates the development and growth of the tumour as the cell lacks the controls to growth and multiplication.<br />Normally intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be methylated, thereby silencing their expression. In cancer cells these regions are typically hypomethylated, thereby increasing genomic instability as active repetitive elements tend to create illegitimate recombination of repeats, activation of repeats and transposition and finally activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes.<br />The result of both hypermethylation of specific locus (typically CpG islands for genes that are tumour supressors) and the hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements leads to lack of control of growth and multiplication of the cell as well as increased genomic instability... both hallmarks of cancer cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">On the paternal allele Igf2 is expressed because the imprinted control region (ICR) is methylated and the methylation extends to the H19 gene thereby silencing it. Since the ICR and H19 gene are methylated the downstream enhancers link to Igf2 thereby promoting its expression.<br />On the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated, which allows the CTCF protein to bind to it, blocking the Igf2 gene thereby forcing the downstream enhancers to link to the second best locus, the H19 gene, which is then expressed.<br />So in this case there is paternal imprinting (silencing of the paternal ICR) but that actually results in Igf2 gene expression.<br />In Wilm's tumour both alleles behave like the paternal allele (which could result from loss of impriting, uniparental disomy or epigenetic disruption for loss of imprinting), resulting in overexpression of the Igf2 gene, which creates excessive growth which can lead to cancer, in this case it's linked to kidney cancer in children (Wilm's tumour).<br />The contribution to cancer is the overexpression of the Igf2 oncogene, which excessively promotes growth of the cell, which may lead to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the DNA Methyltransferases (DNMT) inhibitors. <br />Decitabine irreversibly binds DNMTs, thereby ensuring they are no longer available to methylate other DNA sites. By doing this it in effect reduces the DNA methylation. This mechanism is replication dependent but since cancer cells replicate rapidly they are more impacted by the drug.<br />By reducing DNA methylation in particular for cancer cells where there is CpG hypermethylation we can reduce the hypermethylation, permit the expression of tumour suppressor genes thereby controlling the cancer cells and allow for the cancer to be controlled.<br />Typically these drugs are used in conjunction with other chemotherapy, thereby increasing the impact on the cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is passed on from parent to daughter cells, as such the impact of epigenetic change will be visible down that cell line. <br />A sensitive period is a period when the cells are more sensitive to epigenetic and/or genetic changes. The typical periods are early embryonic development and primordial germ cell development when the epigenetic marks are removed.<br />Treating patients during sensitive periods may lead to unintended secondary effects from the drug as it will all cells will be more sensitive to the epigenetic change. In non-sensitive periods cells are still sensitive to potential epigenetic changes but much less so which would limit unintended secondary effects. Also cancer cells will be comparatively more sensitive than normal cells to the treatment.</div>
