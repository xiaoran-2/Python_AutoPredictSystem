    <h1>Submission 178 from Anon (session_user_id: 4dbc2fc3e0b567431d13223720efce2c852c5366)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cells there is hypomethylation of the CpG islands and the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated, whereas in cancerous cells the CpG islands are observed to be hypermethylated and the latter to be hypomethylated.This leads to silencing of suppressor genes for the CpG islands leading to rapid cell division resulting in tumour outgrowth. In case of intergenic regions and reptitive elements normal hypermethylation is associated with greater genomic stability.During cancer,hypomethylation leads to deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations in the chromosomes.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">At the H19/Igf2 locus in a cell,methylation of the paternal allele at the ICR is observed and no methylation at the maternal allele.Downstream enhancers act on H19 as a result of CTCF binding to the maternal strand, whereas due to methyl marks there is no binding of CTCF to paternal allele leading to silencing of H19 gene as the enhancers direct the expression of Igf2.When this ICR becomes hypermethylated both the strands appear to be of paternal origin and get expressed as such. This is linked to Wilm's tumour where the system gets a double dose of growth promoting Igf2 and no dose of H19.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a member of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors and are responsible for the hypomethylation of DNA. The inhibitor is useful for treating myelodysplastic syndrome which is a precursor of acute myelogenous leukaemia. The anti-tumour effect in case of Decitabine has been linked to reactivation of epigenetically silenced tumour suppressor genes which is induced by hypomethylation.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is an easy target in treatments because of its easy manipulation. The DNA methyltransferase enzymes preserve methyl marks during mitosis ensuring the enduring effects.These inteventions can interfere with the normal functioning of the system when the extensive epigenetic programming occurs. It would be inadvisable to prescribe these treatments to pregnant mothers due to a lot of reprogramming happening during early child development as well as during the gamete formation.<br /></div>
