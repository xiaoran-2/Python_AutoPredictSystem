    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is synonymous with gene silencing, this is done by way of the methylation attracting other 
epigenetic machinery which remodels the chromatin by condensing it.<br />CpG islands are rich in promoter genes, however they are normally not methylated, there are a lot of tumor suppressing genes in CpG islands, sometimes when these regions are hypermethylated this can be an indication of cancer because cancer cells are more likely to grow in combination with other genetic insults as expanded upon in the Knudson hypothesis. <br /><br />In repetitive and intergenic regions there is normally genome wide hypermethylation, there is a lot of potential for genes to interfere with each other in this region due to the large number of repeats. Methylation in this area keeps it in a safer and condensed heterochromatin state. To expand,the methylation is paramount to genomic stability in these areas otherwise deletions, abnormal insertions and reciprocal translations can occur. If the abnormal hypomethylation allows enough of these accidental switches in genetic structure occur cancer can result because the genes will be misaligned or not fomred correctly, and transcription machinery will move in abnormal ways activating incorrect promoters and especially repeats that were supposed to be silenced, which could jump all over the genome potentially further activating negatively consequential genes.<br /><br />To review, cancer can be caused via a  complicated feedback loop involving both genetic and epigenetic mutations. These mutations can be caused by environmental insults or just as a by product of aging. Seeing as a lot of these changes are mitotically heritable, this shows how the process of mutations could eventually lead to a diagnosis of cancer.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The h19/Igf2 cluster is an example of enhancer blocking.<br />The imprint control region is imprinted in the paternal allele. This imprint control region is closely neighboring the h19 promoter and the methylation spreads downstream to it, where it is silenced because its a CpG island promoter. The enhancers are then free to act on Igf2.  On the maternal allele the imprint control region is normally not methylated, which leads it to being bound by an insulator protein called CTCF. This protein prevents the prefered action of the downstream enchancers, ie. the acting upon and subsequent expression of lgf2 and the enhancers then take a secondary route and act upon h19 instead.<br /><br />Loss of imprinting either due to an imprinting disorder or mutations in this particular cluster can contribute to cancer.  In Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome growth is over expressed due to inheritance of two paternal alleles, This leads to an overdose of Igf2 and a loss of growth suppressing cdkn1c which should have been expressed on the maternal allele. This uneven growth profile means that people with this syndrome have abnormal growth and are more likely to develop tumors in their childhood such as Wilm's tumor.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent, it is a drug that inhibits DNA methylation. Many cancers are initially formed from a neoplasm or tumor which are abnormal build up of cells that have multiplied unchecked, all display incorrect gene expression that is harmful to the organism.<b> </b>Myelodysplastic syndrome is an example of  epigenetic mutations of the DNA  in blood cells and can often progress to acute myelogenous leukemia. Decitabine can prevent the carcinogenesis to leukemia by reducing methylation at the promoters of tumour suppressing genes at CpG islands which were likely becoming hypermethylated leading to the initial unchecked growth. To be exact, Decitabine will remove the 5-methyl group from the CpG dinucleotides of the DNA reducing the methylation profile of the islands and preventing the methylation from being mitotically herited and reopening the chromatin back up allowing the tumour suppressor genes to be expressed more easily for healthy cell function.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have enduring effects upon the epigenome because the changes they induce are mitotically heritable. This means that the changes are passed on to each subsequent generation of cells and are unlikely to be altered unless artificially tampered with again because it is very rare for the epigenome to reprogram itself. When it is being reprogrammed this is seen as a sensitive period in which it would be unwise to treat patients because during these busy times epigenetic marks are reset and cleared making the cells vulnerable to any environmental influences or in this case direct modification of the epigenome via drug treatment. An incursion on sensitive times could result in the Incomplete or modified clearing of the maternal, paternal, repeats or imprinted genes and could have a multitude of undesired affects for the individual and offspring.<br /><br />Treatment should be avoided on pregnant women or those soon considering so as to protect the developing embryo in it's very sensitive period. Children and their germ cells in particular are sensitive until puberty so it would also be inadvisable to treat them.<br /><br /><br /></div>
