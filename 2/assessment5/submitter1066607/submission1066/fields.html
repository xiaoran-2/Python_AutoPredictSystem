    <div class="field-value">1. DNA methylation is responsible for inhibiting the expression of genes, due to a genetic defect that is recognized and gene expression stops. However, this situation does not always happen this might not be detected and expressed and translated an error or genetic mutation. CpGs are coding regions which promote or perform gene expression when they are methylated the expression of a gene is inactivated.
Two. Sometimes errors occur reading the DNA and this does not detect any errors that may be in the individual's genetic information. Therefore, the system detects the failure and promoter region sequence for further translation and expression terminating this process causing the individual fails to express the system and alter the main unit are its cells.
Three. When there is a disruption because methylation is allowed to transcribe the information leaving an incomplete gene therefore this generates an error in the information being translated by.
4. The CpGs islands are repetitive regions are only formed by cytosine and guanine in most cases promoters and elements are as guides for fragment encoding is performed.
5. When the region is not a promoter or a TATA box are the sequences that can be repeated is a change since a gene not only can be formed by a pair of bases repeated must variability appear to be translated to different amino acids and is expressed in a correct way the gene.
6. When there is an interruption in repetitive sequences or non-coding intergenic part translates information consequently resulting translation deficiency therefore this gene is considered a mutation that can be expressed as cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">1. The expression of Igf2 is contributed by parent information because it is monoallelic when deleted IGF2 H19 increases, however, has been described that a booster acting on IGF2 and H19 that is found in the same organs and competing for the same enhancer arriba 3´ stream.

2. Expression of H19 is provided by the information of the parent because it is monoallelic when H19 IGF2 increase is suppressed, however, it has been described that a booster acting on IGF2 and H19 ie that found in the same organs and competing for the same enhancer arriba 3´ stream.

.3 When a high overexpression of H19 present at risk for cancer, or in this case shows Wilms tumor, therefore the IGF2 cluster must be present (when inhibited IGF2 H19 increases, when inhibited increases IGF2 H19 when H19 and IGF2 lies are about the same level). Also, it may happen that at the time the information is translated Son information to indicate that this cluster is therefore inhevitable that the child is likely to develop some form of cancer or tumor overexpressed obtained.
April. H19 and IGF2 When cluster are deleted the individual who has manifested increased growth and presents no risk of cancer this information. Also occurs when H19 and IGF2 are normal.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">1. The inhibitor GSK2816126 information methylated enzymes and regulators that generate not overexpress if this has a change does not affect the system that is supposed to regulate in this case the enzyme inhibitor EZH2 muted.
The JQ1 inhibits substance called BRD4 an epigenetic regulator that is responsible for activating Myc which in turn activate the transcription factor.
2. Is responsible for the genetic information methylate preventing faulty or in some enzymes or regulatory proteins of activation systems where there are defects or mutations and cancer cases can generate gene is expressed.
Three. Decitabine is a drug capable of suppressing an effector activation system is therefore possible to control the site where the mutation is, thereby avoiding a more malignant tumor forms or to continue their development.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">1. When DNA is demethylated and information of a mutated gene that can have an impact on the organism in which it was expressed (mutations in which are represented by diseases) Therefore, methylation is the primary responsibility of which is encoded translating the information to be translated is the normal form of the individual.
. 2 This is the period in which our ancestors have any adverse effect such as: famine, radiation exposure, exposure to toxic chemicals, among others. And they can pass on genetic information from them and as a result more are transmitted to future generations bringing with inherited mutations.
Three. When you are performing genetic reading when read and genetic information is translated to form a new being.
April. Because it can have a greater damage to their genetic information and can generate over time more serious illnesses.</div>
