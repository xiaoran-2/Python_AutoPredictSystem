    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value">Normally, around 70-80% of CpG dinucleotides are methilated in mammalian somatic cells. Methylation of gene promoters usually correlates with silencing gene expression. Some promoters have unmethylated CpG islands, this means they are transcribed. They are hypermethylated in case of cancer, which in turn can cause silencing of those genes, which might include tumor supressor genes.<br />Intergenic regions and repetetive elements are usually methylated to prevent transposons from jumping and disrupting functional genes. These areas get hypomethylated during cancer and thus, transposable elements can copy themselves and insert into previously functional genes, disrupting them. Thus if a transposon lands in a gene that is responsible for suppresing tumors or unlimited growth, cancer begins to develop.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Igf2 and ICR on a maternal allele is normally unmethylated and this causes the transcription of H19 gene, because enhancers are free to act. This leads to methylation of H19 gene on a paternal allele, which in turn, in a normal cell, is methylated and thus H19 is silenced and  on a paternal  are silenced. ICR of paternal allele is methylated beforehand - hence, imprinting. <br /><br />In Wilm's tumor, both ICRs and H19s are hypermethylated and thus H19s are silenced on both alleles and this leads to overexpression of Igf2. Igf2 is promoting growth and double the dose, promotes the growth doubly, and so, tumor grows.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor and serves to hypomethylate DNA. If a tumor is caused by a hypermethylation of certain CpG islands, such drug, could prevent methylation of second strand of DNA after copying and mitotically dividing, restoring normal gene methylation and functioning in subsequent daughter cells, thus supressing tumor and resuming normal function.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can cause certain genes to be expressed more strongly or silence them. This could in turn lead to lasting consequences by supressing or overexpressing genes that code proteins responsible for epigenetic modifications, such as further DNA methylation or histone modification.<br /><br />Sensitive periods are such periods in which epigenetic marks, mostly methylation, is removed and established anew.<br />These periods are just after fertilization and during germ cell developement. <br /><br />Treating patients with such drugs during sensitive periods - i.e. female gamete developement (childhood to adolescence) could interfere with developement of those gametes and so interfere with imprinting and that is only if gametes develop at all, this could lead to infertility.</div>
