    <div class="field-value">A person normally has hypomethylation at CpG islands. That means that the gene will be able to express. In cancer, CpG islands are hypermethilated. That means thar the gene will be sileced. This gene probably is a tumour suppressor, and, if you have both alleles mutated or silenced, you will develop cancer, because you could not control the cell division.<br /><br />Methylation of intergenic regions, CpG poor promoters and repetitive elements are important for genomic stability, because it avoids illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, and also cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes. In cancer, these regions tend to be hypomethylated, so all this phenomena take place in a tumoral cell, and it could alter the normal expression of proto-oncogenes.<br /><br />Also, in CpG poors promoters, hymomethylation can result in activation of genes, like R-Ras in gastrical cancer (A potent oncogen), or miR21, which reduces the amount of PTEN (A tumour suppressor) in glioma.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In paternal allele, the Imprinted control region (ICR) is methylated, so enhancers will act on Igf2, because the protein CTCF can't bind to the insulator elements, and H19 will be silenced.<br /><br />In maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated, so CTCF binds its insulator elements, and enhancers will act on H19, and Igf2 will be silenced in the maternal allele.<br /><br />

In Wilm's tumour, both alleles are hypermethylated, it's the same sittuation as if they were both paternal alleles. Paternal and maternal allele will have silenced H19, and expressed Igf2, which means that it will be overexpressed, and it is a growth promoter, so cells will divide and the tissue will expand.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Its function is the same as azacitidine, so it is a DNA-demethylating agent. When you are treated with this drug, your DNA is hypomethylated. 
<br /><br />
In cancer, hypermethylation of CpG islands is very frequent, and it can affect to a tumour suppressor, which are cell division regulator. If both alleles are silenced by hypermethylation, cells will divide uncontroled (cancer). With this drug, the promoter comes back to unmethylated, and tumour suppressor will be active again, and normal division will take place.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is passed on cell division to daughter cells. It means that, if a CpG island is methylated, it will stay methylated due to DNMT1, which maintain the methylation pattern. However, if you alter the methylation, and the CpG island becomes unmethylated, DNMT1 will maintain this unmethylation on daughter cells, and will not be methylated again. That is why the effects endure beyond the period of drug treatment.
<br /><br />
A sensitive period is an actively epigenome modification period. That means that enviromental factors like diet will alter the methylation pattern. These sensitive periods are the early embryogenesis development and germ cells formation. If you treat female patients when they are pregnant, it could case abnormal development of the embryo, because you are disrupting the normal epigenetic changes.</div>
