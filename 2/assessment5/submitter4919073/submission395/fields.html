    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is almost always found in CpG dinucleotides, and it plays different roles in the regulation of gene expression depending on the context where these CpGs are found.<br />In normal cells, the CpGs in intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be methylated while CpG islands in promoters are usually unmethylated. <br />In the first case, the methylation is a way of maintaining the silencing of the repetitive elements so that they are not able to jump and get inserted along the genome, what could disrupt the reading frame of different genes. In the intergenic regions the methylation ensures genome stability.<br />On the other hand, the lack of methylation in CpG islands maintains an open chromatin allowing the attachment of transcription factors, so it correlates with active transcription genes.<br /><br />In cancer cells, the methylation pattern is completely changed. There is an increase in CpG islands methylation and a decrease in intergenic and repetitive elements methylation. <br />The main consequence of the methylation of CpG islands is the silencing of a broad number of genes, which include many tumor suppressor genes.These genes are now unable to control cell growth, so proliferation is favoured.<br />In the case of the hypomethylation, when it is found in repetitive elements, the main consequence is that transposons are no longer repressed and are free to jump and amplify their presence in the genome, and possibly would disrupt many genes. Together with the hypomethylation in intergenic regions, they are involved in the increase of genome instability, due to aberrant recombinations. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The H19/Igf2 cluster is an example of imprinting in which the differences in the methylation pattern between the maternal an the paternal allele determine a balanced expression of the growth factor Igf2.<br />In the maternal allele the Imprint Control Region (ICR) is unmethylated, so the CTCF insulator binds to it and the upstream enhancers can not reach the Igf2 gene and can not activate it. Instead, the enhancer activates the H19 gene.<br />In the paternal allele the ICR is methylated and the CTCF insulator is not able to bind to it. This allows the enhancers to activate the Igf2 gene and not the H19 gene,<br />In this way, a normal cell will express Igf2 from the paternal allele and H19 from the maternal allele in a balanced way. In contrast, in Wilm's tumour this balanced is disrupted because of the hypermethylation of the maternal allele. This makes the maternal allele to act as the paternal, what results in the absence of H19 and a double dose of Igf2. As Igf2 is a growth factor, a higher dose will contribute to a higher proliferation rate and consequently will lead to cancer.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a demethylating drug (DNMT inhibitor) that is on the market for cancer therapies. As a DNMTi, its mechanism of action consists in getting incorporated in the DNA sequence as an analog with a high affinity for DNMTs, so that they get stucked to DNA and are not able to act elsewhere.<br />With a low dose of Decitabine, we get an important amount of demethylation in cancer cells compared with normal cells. The reason is that as the mechanisms of action of the drug is dependent of replication, it will be preferentially incorporated in cells with a high proliferation rate, as cancer cells. So it seems a good drug to discriminate between cancer cells and normal cells, decreasing the possible side effects.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The reason why the effects of a DNA demethylation therapy will last after the treatment is the mitotic heritability of the epigenetic marks. <br />This effect is even more important if it takes place during the sensitive periods for DNA demethylation, the periods of development where DNA methylation is erased and reestablished. In mammals, these two sensitive periods occur during primordial germ cells development and during early embryonic development. If an epigenetic treatment is received during these periods, the consequences would be the maintenance of the demethylated state of DNA during the rest of the patient's life or the transmission of the demethylation to the offspring via the gametes. The first case would happen if a patient is treated during pregnancy, because the embryo would demethylate its DNA and this would be maintained during the rest of the development. The second case would happen when young patients are treated. If the treatment coincides with their primordial germ cells development, the demethylation would be maintained in their gametes and therefore would be transmitted to their next generation.<br /><br /><br /></div>
