    <div class="field-value"><p>The <strong>CpG islands </strong>are regions of DNA with a <strong>high Cytosine plus Guanine content </strong>and a <strong>high frequency of CpG dinucleotides </strong>relative to the bulk genome. The
<strong>CpG islands</strong> are predominantly found in the <strong>promoters </strong>of the genes. Housekeeping
Genes, tissue specific genes and developmental regulator genes with promoter
rich in CpG islands tend to be expressed in normal cells. The <strong>CpG islands </strong>in
these cells are <strong>unmethylated</strong> which reflects the <strong>transcriptionally active state</strong>
of the respective gene.</p>

<p><span>The <strong>promoters</strong> with CpG islands
tend to become <strong>hypermethylated in cancer cells</strong>, which then <strong>causes silencing of
the underlying gene</strong>. The hypermethylation of the CpG islands can cause tumors
by shutting off tumor – suppressor genes which are involved in suppressing
tumor formation and helps repair DNA. Although it is known that epigenetic
changes do no alter the DNA sequences these changes tends to increase the
mutations in a given DNA sequence. For example the hypermethylation of the
promoter for the MGMT gene is known to increase the G to A mutations.</span></p>

<p><span>The chemical modification of the
CpG islands in these genes are known to be the trademark of many kinds of
tumors and are known to occur early in the development of cancer.  </span></p>

<p><span>The <strong>CpG dinucleotide </strong>of lower
densities are found in the <strong>intergenic regions </strong>and <strong>repetitive elements</strong>. In
<strong>healthy cells </strong>these sequences are often <strong>repressed through DNA methylation</strong>.
However, <strong>the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements </strong>have been found to
be<strong> hypomethylated in cancer</strong>. The hypomethylation of the CpG dinucleotide leads
to<strong> chromosome instability </strong>due to <strong>reactivation of transposable elements </strong>and <strong>loss
of imprinting</strong>. For example the loss of imprinting of Insulin like growth factor
gene (IGF2) is known to increase risk of colorectal cancer which is associated
with Beckwith – Wiedemann syndrome and poses increased risk of cancer for
newborns.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The <strong>genomic imprinting </strong>which brings
about the <strong>parental allele specific expression of H19/IGF2 cluster </strong>is controlled
by two regulatory regions namely a differentially methylated region - <strong>DMR</strong> (also
called as the imprint control region – ICR) upstream of H19 and a set of
<strong>enhancers</strong> downstream of H19. </span></p>

<p>On the <strong>paternal allele</strong>, methylation
of the H19 promoter and the DMR prevents CTCF (transcription factor) from
binding the DMR. This prevents the expression of H19 and allows the enhancer to<strong>
promote the expression of IGF2.</strong></p>

<p>On the <strong>maternal allele </strong>the <strong>DMR
remains unmethylated </strong>allowing the CTCF to bind to it, this generates an
insulator that prevents IGF2 from accessing the shared enhancer and they
instead <strong>promote H19 expression</strong>.</p>

<p><span>In<strong> Wilm’s tumor </strong>there is <strong>loss of
imprinting </strong>on the <strong>maternal chromosome</strong>. The loss of imprinting on the maternal chromosome causes it to switch to a
paternal epigenotype where the DMR and the H19 promoter are methylated leading
to the<strong> over expression of the IGF2</strong>.</span><span>This increases the
production of insulin like growth factor 2 in cells of certain tissues.
Increased IGF2 stimulates the growth of tumor cells and prevents the damaged
cells from being destroyed. Over expression of the IGF2 is associated with
several types of cancers known as embryonic tumors.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Decitabine</strong> belongs to the class of
epigenetic drugs that act as <strong>DNA
demethylating agent/hypomethylating agent</strong>. This drug has been shown to be
effective to treat acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes. Tumor
cells/neoplastic cells exhibit global hypomethylation, localized
hypermethylation of CpG islands (CGIs) and increased levels of
methyltransferases. Hypermethylation of CGI not only plays a major role in
tumorogenisis but also influences response to anticancer agents. </p>

<p>In rapidly proliferating cells the
cytotoxicity of<strong> Decitabine </strong>is attributed to its <strong>incorporation into DNA </strong>and
forming<strong> irreversible covalent </strong>bonds with DNMT at cytosine sites targeted for
methylation, <strong>preventing the hypermethylation of genes</strong>. Low doses of Decitabine
with prolonged exposure correlates with changes in gene expression induced by a
reduction in DNA methylation. Decitabine induced hypomethylation in tumor cells
may restore normal function to genes that are important for the control of
cellular differentiation and proliferation. The non-proliferating cells are
insensitive to the effects of decitabine.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic drugs like <strong>Azacitidine
and Decitabine </strong>are <strong>DNA demethylating agents</strong>. These drugs are known to reactivate
the expression of genes that have undergone epigenetic silencing. They are
<strong>nucleoside analogues </strong>which are converted to <strong>dNTPs </strong>and are then incorporated in
place of cytosine in<strong> replicating DNA</strong>. These modified bases <strong>irreversibly bind to
DNA methyltransferases </strong>and prevent them from methylating the cytosine residues
resulting in the formation of <strong>heritably demethylated DNA</strong>.</p>

<p>DNA methylation plays a major role
in gene expression and cell differentiation, researchers have linked errors in
methylation to a range of devastating consequences including cancer, lupus,
muscular dystrophy and a range of birth defects that appear to be caused by
defective imprinting mechanisms.</p>

<p><span>The period where the<strong> epigenome </strong>is
<strong>reprogrammed </strong>and <strong>remodeled</strong> is called as the <strong>sensitive period</strong>.  There are <strong>two sensitive periods </strong>namely the
period from <strong>primordial germ cell </strong>development all the way through the production
of mature eggs and sperm and the second sensitive period is the <strong>pre and post implantation
period</strong>. These sensitive periods are also influenced by the changes in the environment.
<strong>Treating patients </strong>during the <strong>sensitive periods </strong>would be inadvisable as these
drugs may cause the <strong>nonspecific activation of genes </strong>and <strong>transposable elements</strong>
in normal cells and in differentiating cells affecting normal embryonic
development, X chromosome inactivation, genomic imprinting and preservation of
chromosome stability.</span></p></div>
