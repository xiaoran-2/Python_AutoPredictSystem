    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cells, CpG islands are generally unmethylated.  In cancer, CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes are hypermethylated, resulting in silencing of these genes.  Tumor suppressor genes are necessary in the process of preventing a cell from becoming cancer and with decreased expression of these genes, cancerous cells are more likely to become tumors.  <br />In contrast, intergenic regions and repetitive elements in normal cells are generally methylated for increased genome stability.  In cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated, resulting in genome instability due to illegitimate recombination and activation of repeats and cryptic promoters which disrupt neighboring genes and increase tumorigenesis.  <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cells, the imprint control region on the paternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated, preventing CTCF from binding and allowing Igf2 to be expressed though the action of downstream enhancers.  The imprint control region on the maternal allele is unmethylated, allowing CTCF to bind.  CTCF insulates Igf2 from the action of enhancers, which instead act on H19, resulting in H19 expression.  In Wilm's tumor, hypermethylation of the H19/Igf2 cluster results in loss of imprinting (methylation of the ICR on the maternal allele), which results in increased Igf2 expression and loss of H19 expression.  Overexpression of Igf2, a growth promoting gene, and loss of H19 expression, a growth restricting gene, contributes to unregulated cell growth and tumorigenesis.  </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor which is incorporated into the DNA during replication and irreversibly binds DNMTs, prohibiting their activity and resulting in decreased methylation.  In tumors where CpG islands of tumor suppressors are hypermethylated, Decitabine can increase expression of tumor suppressors by decreasing methylation of their CpG islands.  </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, altering DNA methylation with drugs can have enduring effects on the genome beyond the period of drug treatment.  Because of the enduring effects of epigenetic drugs and their genome-wide effects, sensitive periods of development, which are periods of active epigenetic remodelling, should be avoided when treating patients with such drugs.  Primordial germ cell development through mature gamete development and pre-implantation to early post-implantation are the two sensitive periods of human development.  During these periods of development, certain epigenetic marks need to be removed and certain epigenetic marks need to be laid down so proper development can occur.  Drugs that alter the epigenetic machinery would disrupt these necessary epigenetic changes.  </div>
