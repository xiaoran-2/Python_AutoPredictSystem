    <h1>Submission 517 from Anon (session_user_id: 4be2d3aeeb5ca9659fce998bd21a58dc5d306339)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Epigenetic control is essential for all cell types and drugs which affect methylation may alter healthy cells as well as
unhealthy or cancerous cells which is why people have been wary about using
them but the aim is patient survival so need to try them.  There could be consequences downstream of a targeted
gene and side effects that hadn’t been considered.  Epigenetic drugs work beyond the period of
drug treatment because the DNA methylation is mitotically heritable so any
change will be passed to the daughter cells. 
</span></p>

<p><span>A sensitive period is a time when the epigenome is being
reprogrammed in some way when the epigenetic marks are cleared and re-established.  </span></p><p><span>Early embryonic development and during
primordial germ cell (PGC) developments are examples of a sensitive period.  </span></p>

<p><span>During early embryonic development and PGC development altering the epigenome could cause altered re-establishment of epigenetic marks. During the maturation of oocytes and throughout
fertile years of adults may also be problematic.  If gametes were adversely affected during a
sensitive period it could lead to abnormalities or perhaps infertility in F1
and even F2 generations (evidence from mouse models that suggest changes in DNA
methylation can affect the epigenome in F1 and F2 generations). </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is altered in two ways in cancer: there
is genome wide loss of methylation (hypo) at intergenic and repetitive sites and
extra methylation (hyper) at specific sites such as CpG islands (depending on cell
type). </p>

<p><span>Normal function of DNA methylation usually involves CpG
islands that are <b>unmethylated </b>(occasionally
CpG islands are methylated - this is associated with gene silencing e.g. X
inactivation).  CpG islands are found at
promoters of genes where the transcription factories bind.  </span></p>

<p>In cancer CpG islands become methylated and this
can lead to gene silencing of tumour suppressor genes which means the tumour
will continue to grow as epimutations are rapidly selected. As DNA methylation
is mitotically heritable it means that this methylated state will be sustained.  Silencing of tumour suppressor genes alone will not
cause cancer, as needs others ‘hits’ (Knudson hypothesis).  Hypermethylation may also happen at CpG
island shores and affect surrounding genes. 
CpG island methylation varies by tumour type and tends to progress
with time so the CpG islands get more methylated as the cancer grows.  </p>

<p><span>Intergenic and repetitive elements are usually<b> methylated</b> in normal cells.    The
function of DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to
maintain genomic stability and to stop strong promoters cutting/copying/
pasting parts of themselves into other genes. Methylation prevents transposition,
mutations, deletions and illegitimate recombinations.    </span></p>

<p>If the intergenic regions and repetitive elements become
unmethylated as in cancer then the genome becomes unstable and can lead to
deletions, translocations, insertions  and transpositions and illegitimate recombination.    In cancer it is more common for the repeats
to become unmethylated.  Loss of
methylation can also cause activation of cryptic promoters and oncogenes and
other growth promoting genes. For recombination’s to occur the chromatin needs to be
open (euchromatin).  When the chromatin
is methylated as in healthy cells then the chromatin is compacted and recombination less likely. </p>

<p>Some cancers are driven by tumour suppressor genes and
some cancers by chromosomal instability. 
The driving role is context specific.

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinted genes  undergo epigenetic reprogramming  in the primordial germ cells. Imprinted genes can be
expressed through the paternal or maternal allele (monoallelic
expression).  Having 2 different epialleles
is crucial for viability. About 150 genes are imprinted in humans.  Imprinted genes exist in clusters and have their own imprint control region (ICR).  </p>

<p>On the paternal allele the ICR is an example of an
imprinted methylated ICR.  The ICR is methylated
on H19/lgf2 cluster which blocks CTCF from binding.  DNA methylation of the ICR spreads to
H19 promoter to silence it and so the enhancers are able to access lgf2 which
is activated. </p>

<p>On the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated which
allows CTCF (insulator protein) to bind and so protects lgf2 from downstream
enhancers so they act on H19 instead and lgf2 is not activated/not
expressed.  </p>

<p>In Wilms tumour (childhood kidney tumour)  ICR is hypermethylated on both paternal and
maternal alleles meaning CTCF is unable to bind to the ICR which means
that the enhancers
access lgf2 giving  a double dose of lgf2 as both alleles behave like the paternal allele.  </p><p>lgf2 is
a growth promoting gene and so contributes to cancer by over expressing lgf2.  The loss of imprinting is a common early
event in tumours and is often seen in preneoplastic tissue.  </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to a group of DNA demethyltransferases
inhibitors (DNMTi) that work on DNMT1 by inhibiting its ability to bind to
DMNT3a/b and so stopping methylation to be passed onto daughter cells.</p><p>It is
used to treat acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML), blood cancer.  Is an enzymatic targeting agent and nucleoside
analogue.   DNMT demethyltransferases were originally used
in the 1970s but in much higher doses.  Lower
doses have good anti-cancer effects.  </p><p>Decitabine
works by inhibiting methylation.   Cancer cells are more affected because they
are dividing more.  Need to have the
cells dividing for the drug to work.  Gradually
the hyper methylation is reduced in the cells. It has also been shown that it may
make traditional chemotherapy more effective in solid tumours.  Don’t know for sure that DNA demethylation is
their only action.  It could be that they
are having other effects that we do not yet know about. Decitabine doesn’t have
too severe side effects. </p></div>
