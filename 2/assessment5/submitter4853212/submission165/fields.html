    <h1>Submission 165 from Anon (session_user_id: 2ca31232f3d51d7806839f3c20b64c56f2b10f38)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at CpG islands can silence the gene expression.<br />In cancer, CpG island hypermethylation occurs.<br />The DNA hypermethylation at CpG islands silences the tumor suppressor genes, and this contributes to cancer development.<br />The function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to maintain the genomic integrity.<br />DNA hypomethylation occurs <span>in intergenic regions and repetitive elements of tumor cell. <br />The </span>DNA hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements leads to genomic instability, and the chromosomal instability enhances tumorigenesis.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In paternal allele, DNA methylation at ICR blocks the binding of CTCF , spreads to H19 promoter and enhancers to to silence H19 and activate Igf2.<br />In maternal allele, the unmethylated ICR allows the binding of CTCF. This insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers and activates H19 gene.<br />In Wilm's tumour, ICR is hypermethylated, which leads to the silencing of H19 and expression of Igf2 in both maternal and paternal alleles.<br />The loss of expression of growth restricting genes and overexpression of growth promoting genes help cancer to develop.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the class of <span>DNA-demethylating agents.<br /></span>Decitabine can remove the methyl group from nucleotides and reduce the level of DNA methylation.<br />The use of Decitabine makes the CpG islands in cancer cells demethylated. The activated tumor suppressor genes cause the anti-tumor effect.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Somatic cells can maintain the epigenetic characteristics for a long time, making the altered DNA mathylation have enduring effects.<br />The sensitive period means at this time the cell (or organism) is susceptible to environmental stimuli.<br />Pre-implantation development and germ cell development are two sensitive periods of development.<br />Reprogramming occurs during the two sensitive periods, so treating patients in early development and PGC development will make the drug efficacy<div>unmaintainable.<br /></div></div>
