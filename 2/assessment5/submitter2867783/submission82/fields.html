    <div class="field-value"><p style="margin-bottom:0in;"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2">CpG
islands are areas with a high frequency of CpG sites, and can
function as gene promoters, or the beginning of the gene.  In normal
cells the CpG islands are generally not methylated.  Methylation of
the CpG islands is associated with suppression of the gene
expression, by prohibiting transcription of factor binding.  In
normal cells the CpG islands tend to be protected from methylation,
making the genes able to be expressed.  The intergenic regions,
repetitive elements and introns tend to be methylated in normal
cells.  In cancer, the patterns for CpG islands and for the other
areas are reversed.  The CpG islands are often methlylated, and the
intergenic regions, repetitive elements and introns are much less
methylated.  These disruptive patterns increase over time.  The CpG
island methylation tends to suppress the expression of tumor
suppressor genes in cancer, and this causes the cancer cells to
divide more rapidly.  The lack of methlyation of intergenic regions and
repetitive elements can alter the genes similar to a genetic mutation
in oncogenes and/or tumor suppressor genes. Methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements promote gene stability, that is they prevent mutations to the gene itself.   If they are not sufficiently methlyated, chance increase for gene mutations that cause cancer to occur.  The methylation patterns and gene mutations are
mitotically heritable, which effectively locks down the suppression
of the tumor suppressor genes.</font></font></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The
imprint control region (ICR) of Igf2 is methylated on the paternal
allele, and unmethylated on the maternal allele in normal cells.  In
normal function, this causes CTCF to bind an insulator element on the
maternal ICR, which causes enhancers to act on the H19 cluster, and
Igf2 is silenced.  On the paternal side, the CTCF does not bind to
the methylated allele, and H19 is methlyated, which allows the
enhancers to act on Igf2, resulting in Igf2 expression.  In Wilm's
tumor and loss of imprinting, the ICRs on both the maternal and
paternal alleles are methylated, and H19 is methylated on both.  This
causes the enhancers to work on the Igf2 in both maternal and
paternal alleles, resulting in Igf2 being expressed in both.  This
results in a double dose of Igf2, which is a growth promoting gene. 
The double dose causes the growth of tumors in a particular kidney
cancer often found in children.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine
is a new drug in a class of DNA-demythlating agents.  Methylation is
associated with gene suppression, so demethylating allows for more
gene expression.  In cancer the genes that tend to get suppressed are
the tumor-suppressor genes.  So demethylating the suppressor genes
would allow them to be expressed, and to act on tumors to destroy the
tumor cells.  The drug agents work by binding to DNA methlytranferase
(Dnmt), the enzymes that enable the methylation, effectively
neutralizing the enzymes.  Decitabine can have an anti-tumor effect
by preventing the methylation of tumor-suppressor genes.  If the
suppressor genes are expressed, they are able to destroy tumor cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">NA
methylation is mitotically heritable, so changes are generally passed
to daughter cells when the cells divide.  Thus changes in DNA
methylation have enduring effects on the epigenome.    If a treatment alters the methlylation pattern in cells, the pattern will remain established as those cells divide, thus causing effects that last beyond the treatment period.  There are two
sensitive periods when the DNA methylation patterns in cells are
being established.  The first is in pre-implantation development of
the fertilized egg, and the second
is in primordial germ cell development. DNA methlyation
patterns allow cells to develop to form many different tissue types,
and the patterns are removed in the early embryo in order to allow
totipotency.  It would
be inadvisable to treat a patient during pregnancy when the embryo is
developing, or while primordial germ cells are forming within the embryo. 
During embryonic development, a disruption in methlylation pattern
establishment could cause cells not to develop properly into the
various organs and different cell types.  During primordial germ cell development, a disruption in methylation patterns could
cause problems in fertility of the embryo in his or her adult years, or
could affect the development of the child of the embryo.
