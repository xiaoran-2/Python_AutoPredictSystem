    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value">In normal somatic cells, CpG islands are usually not methylated. In cancer cells, promoter CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated which silences the underlying gene. Many times, in cancer cells, these silenced genes are tumor suppressor genes and this causes the cells to become cancerous. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated in normal cells, but in cancer cells these regions are hypomethylated. The hypomethlyation of repetitive elements and intergenic regions creates genomic instability, such as illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The Imprint Control Region on the paternal allele is methylated. This methylation blocks CTCF from binding and thus down stream enhancers are free to activate Igf2 transcription. The Imprint Control  Region on the maternal allele is unmethlyated. Since the ICR is unmethylated, CTCF binds to the ICR. This then blocks the downstream enhancers from activating Igf2, and instead the lncRNA H19 is transcribed. Wilms tumour is caused by the loss of imprinting on the maternal allele. The loss of imprinting on the maternal allele means the promoter for Igf2 is unmethylated and active. This causes an overexpression of the oncogene Igf2 and subsequently a loss of expression of tumor suppressor Cdkn1c. Because Igf2 is a growth promoting gene and is overexpressed these cells become tumorogenic and cause Wilms tumour in the kidney. The deletion or mutation of the imprinting at H19/Igf2 cluster results in an overexpression of an oncogene and a silencing of a tumor suppressor, thus increasing the chance of cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. By inhibiting DNA methyltransferase, it allows differentiation and apoptosis of leukemic cells. Decitabine is a cytosine analogue that, once inside the cell, is phosphorylated and then competes with and replaces cytosine in the CpG islands. During subsequent cell divisions, the phosphorylated Dectabine inhibits methylation of the promoter by covalently binding with DNA methyltransferase, which contributes to the degradation of the enzyme. This reduces the hypermethylation of CpG island promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes, thus allowing the cell to avoid becoming cancerous. In summary, Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor that covalently binds DNA methyltransferase and is mitotically dependent.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and therefor can effect the epigenome indefinitely. A sensitive period is any time the DNA is in a state where environmental factors can have an affect on the DNA. Sensitive periods during development are the period from primordial germ cell development through production of gametes. And another sensitive period is the period from pre-implantation to early post-implantation. Treating younger patients, who still have developing germ cells, with epigenetic drugs can severely disrupt the epigenetic machinery, since when germ cells are developing is an epigenetically sensitive period.<br /></div>
