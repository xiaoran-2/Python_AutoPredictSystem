    <div class="field-value">DNA is normally not methylated in CpG islands, which allows transcription to occur; in cancer it is methylated in these areas, and so transcription is turned off in genes nearby.  When these nearby genes are tumor-suppressor genes, and they are turned off, then cells begin to proliferate and cancer can occur.  In intergenic regions the DNA is normally methylated - these are just one or two residues, not islands of several in a row.  This methylation helps these genes stay active because it seems to inhibit anti-sense transcription and also helps with proper splicing.  Repetitive elements are normally methylated, which keeps them inactive.  In cancer, these repetitive elements are LESS methylated, so they are active, which allows for destabilization of the DNA, which causes more mutations, which can lead to cancer if oncogenes or tumor-suppressors are affected.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the H19/Igf2 cluster, the ICR is methylated in the paternal chromosome.  That means that the CTCF protein that would like to bind there, can't.  That means that the enhancers can now bind to the Igf2 gene and that gene is now transcribed.  The Igf2 gene is an oncogene, which supports cell division.  The maternal allele is not methylated at the ICR, so the CTCF protein can bind and that binding causes the enhancers to be unable to bind to the Igf2 gene, so instead they bind and turn on expression of the H19 gene.  If the maternal chromosome is not properly imprinted - in other words, if it is methylated like the paternal chromosome is - then the cell has two copies of this oncogene expressed and so divides too often and one of the things that happens in Wilm's tumor.  You can imagine that if you treated a female with a drug that increases methylation when her germ cells are forming, they could be improperly imprinted and lead to Wilm's tumor in her offspring.  Alternatively, a female who has a defect in methylation could pass along an improperly imprinted chromosome, leading to Wilm's tumor.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a demethylating agent.  As such, it decreases methylation, such as what occurs at CpG islands in cancer cells.  By removing the methyl groups at these islands, the nearby genes will become active again.  In these cells that are cancerous, those genes are probably tumor-suppressor genes, so turning them on then would suppress further tumor formation and stop the cancer from growing by stopping these cells from dividing.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">If DNA methylation is removed from a region in one cell, when that cell divides, its offspring will all have proper methylation, which means proper gene control - which means those cells won't be dividing again, at least not inappropriately.  There are two times when epigenetic marks are removed from the DNA, and these are "sensitive periods" - where a drug that affects epigenetic marks could have a long-term, even multi-generational affect, which could be very bad.  Those periods are in the germ cells when they are being formed - not only epigenetic marks are removed, but also imprinting marks are removed and then replaced with the proper paternal or maternal marks.  The other is during embryogenesis (pre-implantation).  If we treated patients during these times we could remove methylation marks that are necessary for imprinting, for example.  This could cause serious problems in the offspring.</div>
