    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is the process of methylation of 5’ group of cytosines within CpG dinucleotides. This process is symmetrical and can be maintained through cell division. The task of methylation is achieved by de novo methyltransferases, DNMT3a and DNMT3b in mammals. CpGs clustered into CpG islands, very often it happens at promtor region. Usually CpG islands are protected from methylation and as a result, gene expression is not silenced.<br />In cancer CpG islands are hypermethylated and as a result tumor suppresor genes are silenced. That means that the tumor will be diving in a continous manner without supportive stopping mechanism. Identity of hypermethylated CpGs varies by tumour type, which was found during genome wide DNA methylation studies. Moreover, methylation progresses with time, but can be confounded by DNA methylation alterations increasing with age. Some examples of hypermethylation include: RB in retinoblastoma, MLH1 in colorectal cancer, BRCA1 in breast cancer, MGMT in gliomas and colorectal tumours.<br />In intergenic regions and repetitive elements during cancer there is a process of hypomethylation. In normal cells these regions are hypermethylated.<br />As a result of hypomethylation, instability occurs. The examples include: illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes.<div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Mechanism of action of the Imprint Control Regions (ICR) varies with different clusters. THe H19/lgf2 cluster is located in human chromosome 11 and methylation pattern varies between maternal and paternal allele. In maternal allele there is CTCF which is an insulator protein and it insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. In contrast paternal allele has active DNA methylation CTCF binding site, therfore insulator protein is not produced. As a result DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence it but enhancers can access Igf2 to activate it.<br /><div>Alterations in DNA methylation at ICRs (either hypo or hypermethylation), can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes or overexpression of growth promoting genes. This is a common, quite early event, frequently observed in pre-neoplastic tissue. In WIlm's tumour there is hypermethylation of maternal ICR and as a result CTCF does not bind and enhancer act on lgf2 and therefore the lgf2 is overexpressed.<br />Disrupted imprinting at the H19/lgf2 cluster is correlated with double dose of lgf2 which is growth promoting region and therefore substantially contributes to cancer.</div><div> </div><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><br />Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent.<br />It hypomethylates DNA by inhibition of DNA methyltransferase.<br />Decitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML).<br />Ravandi <i>et al.,</i> 2010 indicated that Decitabine can be used for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) including previously treated and untreated, de novo and secondary MDS of all French-American-British subtypes (examples include: refractory anemia, refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts, refractory anemia with excess blasts, refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation, and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia )<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the genome based on the fact that <span>epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. After removal, they do not return. It is possible that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.<br />Sensitive period is a time in development when epigenetic marks are established. <br />These include early development (development of the gametes) and Primordial Germ Cells </span> (PGC) development.<br />Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because the treatment can have substantial and not always reversible consequences for establishment of epigenetic programming, in addition, potentially affecting future generation if parenting would be considered.</div>
