    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at CpG islands occurs to regulate gene expression and is a methyl group added directly to the base of DNA. This happens at the cytosines almost always at CPG dinucleotides (symmetrical) so it is retained during cell division. This allows for a mitotic memory of methylation in DNA. In cancer, hypo or hypermethylation occurs at the CpG islands disrupting DNA's normal functions leading to chromosome instability. When DNA begins losing methylation marks (hypomethylation) during transcription this leads to a vicious cycle of increased hypomethylation and ends up resulting in carcinogenesis. DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is used so that the RNA can transcribe cell specific DNA without the need to transcribe the entire DNA strand. In cancer, DNA can become hypomethylated, hypomethylation near genes or promoters can lead to transcriptional interference and allowing access to the CpG islands when they should be transcriptionally silent. The result is unintended transcription of genes leading to the creation of cancerous tissues. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The methylation pattern of the paternal allele is retained in the next generation, therefore if the Igf2 gene is expressed in the paternal allele there is a good chance it will be expressed again. However methylation patterns in the maternal allele are not retained in the next generation, so if the mother has an expressed Igf2 gene it is highly unlikely it will be expressed in the offspring. The expression of the paternal Igf2 and maternal H19 alleles functions as a tumor suppressor gene. So if the imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted the tumor suppressor gene will be rendered ineffective. This in turn will allow cancerous tumors to form and ultimately cause cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to a group of epigenetic drugs called histone-deacetylase inhibitors. A certain enzyme called EZH2 will sometimes become over active in cancer causing methylation in histones at a higher rate than normal. This over production of the EZH2 enzyme will silence genes surrounding itself. In order to combat this, Decitabine will work to inhibit the EZH2 enzyme, slowing the rate of methylation of surrounding histones. This is important because EZH2 will sometimes silence tumor-suppressor genes needed to prevent cancerous growth. So Decitabine may be useful to inhibit cancerous tumors by reducing the effect of the EZH2 enzyme by reducing the methylation and silencing of tumor suppression genes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">When using a DNA altering treatment such as a drug resulting in a reduction of methylation, great care must be taken and serious decision making must be involved. Methylation is an extremely important function in fundamental DNA operation as its purpose is to regulate genes, turning genes on and off as needed. A sensitive period of human development would be defined as a periods of development while still in the womb until the end of childhood. Typically early childhood would be one of the most sensitive times of epigenetic mechanisms. Therefore using methylation altering drugs during sensitive periods of development would be ill-advised as many epigenetic mechanisms are at play in the development of the child.</div>
