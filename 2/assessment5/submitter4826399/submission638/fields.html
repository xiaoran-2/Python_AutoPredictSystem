    <div class="field-value"> In a normal cell, what you see is a hypomethylated CPG island, so you don't see methylation in general at CPG islands.CpG islands tend to be protected from methylation.Methylation at CpG island means  silencing of gene expression. there are  Small subset of CpG islands that are dynamically methylated between cell types, most retain unmethylated status.    <br /><br />In contrast in
general at a Cancer cell, now the CpG islands are more likely to be methylated.
They're not all methylated, but they're more likely to be methylated than in a
normal cell. And the rest of the genome in general, including the repetitive elements
in these intergenic elements, and , the introns, are hypomethylated.<br /><br />DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. So it's a very
effective way of silencing a tumor suppressor gene, and these epimutations can
indeed be rapidly selected for. silencing a tumor suppressor allows that particular
cell to have a competitive advantage over the others in the surrounding tissues,
then over a period of time, the cells that have this epimutation are more
likely to divide more rapidly, or to not die as much( tumorogenesis).<br /><br />In cancer,Hypomethylation of repeats/ intergenic intervals causes  Genomic Instability by several mechanisms  for example by Illegitimate recombination
between repeats or  by  Activation of repeats and transposition or by  Activation of cryptic promoters and disruption
to <span>neighboring genes.</span> <span class="_wysihtml5-temp"></span><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Decitabine has
demonstrated activity in a broad range of hematologic disorders, including MDS,
acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and sickle
cell anemia.<br /><br /></span><p>Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent. It hypomethylates DNA
by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. Decitabine indirectly depletes
methylcytosine and causes hypomethylation of target gene promoters.</p><p>

<span>Decitabine is a cytosine nucleoside analog that,
once incorporated into DNA, inhibits further DNA methylation. As a consequence,
aberrantly silenced genes, including tumor suppressor genes, can be reactivated
and expressed.</span><br /></p><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation of the ICR controls the reciprocal imprinting
of IGF2 and H19 by preventing the binding of the insulator protein, CTCF. </p><p>ICR in the paternal side of igf2 gene  is methylated so no CTCF binding to it so
igf2 is expressed from the paternal allele.ICR in the maternal allele of igf2
gene is unmethyated so CTCF binding to it so igf2 is not expressed from
the  maternal allele. </p><p>Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is predisposing factor in
Wilm’s tumour</p><p>





</p><p>In normal cells, lack of CTCF–cohesin binding at the
paternal ICR is associated with monoallelic interaction between two CTCF sites
flanking the locus. CTCF–cohesin binding at the maternal ICR blocks this
interaction by associating with the CTCF site downstream of the enhancers. </p><p>In
patient-derived cell lines, the mat/pat asymmetric distribution of these
epigenetic marks was lost with H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 becoming biallelic in the
BWS and H3K4me2, H3K27me3  together with
CTCF–cohesin becoming biallelic in Silver– Russell
syndrome (SRS). In BWS and SRS cells, there is
opposing chromatin looping conformation mediated by CTCF–cohesin binding sites
surrounding the locus. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation
is a mainly striking method of regulation to target in treatments because it can
be manipulated once, and lasting effects are ensured as the DNA methyltransferase enzymes preserve methyl marks
during mitosis.</p>

<p> Nevertheless, these
global interventions may interfere with ordinary functioning of the system,
especially during critical periods ­­ periods of time where extensive
epigenetic reprogramming occurs. </p>

<p>Specifically , it would be inadvisable to prescribe these
treatments to pregnant mothers (including a few months before conception) as a
lot of reprogramming happens in early child development as well as during the
formation of gametes (both male and female).</p></div>
