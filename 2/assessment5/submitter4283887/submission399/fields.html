    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are often found near gene promoters. Normally, CpG islands are left unmethylated, which allows normal interaction with transcription proteins that help express the downstream genes. In cancer, hypermethylation of the islands often occurs, which silences the downstream genes, possibly by blocking the transcriptional machinery or by recruiting other proteins that alter the chromatin structure of the DNA. This can lead to cancer if the silenced genes are involved in cell regulation, as the silencing allows cells to grow and proliferate unchecked. Additionally, hypomethylation of oncogenes allows cancer-promoting genes to be expressed, further contributing to the development of cancer.<br /><br />Normally, repetitive elements are heavily methylated, which is thought to help prevent them from being expressed and jumping around in the genome, which can cause mutations or disruptions in other genes. CpGs in intergenic regions tend to be normally methylated as well. This methylation helps ensure genomic stability. In cancer, both repetitive elements and intergenic regions become hypomethylated. This decrease in methylation results in genomic instability, illegitimate recombination, activation of cryptic promoters, and activation and subsequent transposition of repetitive elements.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA de-methylating drug, which means it removes methylation marks from DNA. Hypermethylation (excessive methylation) of 5' regulatory regions is a common hallmark of cancer. This hypermethylation often results in the silencing of tumor suppressor genes, allowing the unchecked growth and proliferation that cause tumors/cancer. By enabling the removal of excessive methylation, Decitabine helps re-activate tumor suppressor genes that were silenced by the hypermethylation at their regulatory regions. The reactivated genes then suppress the growth of the tumor as they are meant to do.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The paternal copy of H19/lgf2 is usually hypermethylated, resulting in expression of Igf2 and suppression of H19. The methylation prevents CTCF from binding to the imprinting control region, which allows the downstream enhancers to contact the promoters of Igf2 and transcribe the gene, while at the same time the methylation of H19 prevents its expression. <br /><br />The maternal copy of H19/lgf2 is usually hypomethylated, resulting in expression of H19 and suppression of lgf2. CTCF is able to bind to the unmethylated imprinting control region, blocking the Igf2 promoters from interacting with the downstream enhancers of H19, which silences Igf2.<br /><br />If the maternal copy experiences loss of imprinting and reverts to the paternal, methylated epigenotype, Igf2 is overexpressed while H19 is silenced, causing increased cell growth. This increased cell growth coupled with the silencing of H19, which acts as a tumor supressor, results in tumor growth and cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is metastable: it is established in early development and persists over the lifetime of the organism, but it is susceptible to change between generations. While methylation marks are plastic and can be changed in response to biological signals or environmental influences, they are generally quite stable and are maintained over many cell divisions. Sensitive periods are particular times during the lifecycle when the epigenome is being actively remodeled and is therefore especially sensitive to change. These periods include primordial germ cell development and the pre-implantation and early post-implantation periods. Treating patients with a drug that seems to alter DNA methylation during these sensitive time periods is inadvisable because it is possible that effects will persist in future generations. Changes to the epigenome has the potential to cause harm in the future to descendants of the original patient.</div>
