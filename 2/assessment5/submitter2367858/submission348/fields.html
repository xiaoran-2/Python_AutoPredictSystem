    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal somatic cells CpG islands are usually kept free of methylation independent of their activity state. In cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene. Those genes are usually tumour suppressors and tumor growth is not halted.<br /><br />Intragenic methylation is found at repetitive sequences such as 
satellite repeats and remnants of retroviral insertions such as LINEs 
and SINEs in human DNA. Methylation makes them silenced. This elements, if not silenced, may jump to other parts of chromosomes and disrupt normal genes, such as tumor suppressors. Generally it leads to genome instability and promotes carcinogenesis.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an inhibitor of DNA methyltranserase. It lowers DNA methylation.<br /></p>Since specific DNA hypermethylation of promotors of tumor supressors is often occuring in cancers, reversing this state will cause expression of tumor supressors and tumor growth inhibition.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Methylation of DNA is transfered to daughter cells during mitosis. So once we change methylation state it will be transfered to further generations of cells. Once we turn off or on some genes through the methylation or demethylation in cancer cells, we may change the phenotype of those cells and this altered phenotype will be transfered further.<br /><br />There are two sensitive periods of development:  gametogenesis and after fertilization. During this periods reprogramming of DNA methylation occurs, alterations of DNA methylation during those processes may lead to big aberrations in development of oocytes, sperm or fetus. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Paternal allelle of H19 is methylated and thus H19 not expressed and LGF2 is expressed from that allele. Maternal allele exhibits opposite pattern of methylation and expression of H19 and LGF2.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumor H19 is expressed from both alleles. Since H19 is known to induce proliferation, overexpression of H19 may lead to cancerogenesis.<br /></div>
