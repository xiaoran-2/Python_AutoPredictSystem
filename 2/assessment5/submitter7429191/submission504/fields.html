    <div class="field-value">Most CpG islands in mammals are unmethylated to allow for gene expression. CpG island methylation is untypical in normal cells.  DNA methylation at CpG islands is normally associated with X-chromosome inactivation, imprinting and ageing. In cancer DNA hypermethylation of  promoter CpG islands can happen that leads to silencing of the underlying gene, including tumour suppressor genes. Tumour suppressor genes enable cells to die or decrease their proliferation.  If tumour suppressor genes are epigenetically silenced, growth of cancer cells can co unchecked.  This hypermethylation with cancer progresses with time. CpG regions in intergenic regions and repetitive elements are generally methylated.  DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements correlates with reduced gene expression - it is involved with genomic stability and helps prevent insertions, deletions and reciprocal translations.  In cancer intergenic regions and repetitive elements can be hypomethylated. This can lead to genomic instability and oncogene activation - this includes Illegitimate recombination between repeats; activation of repeats and transposition; activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes . This hypomethylation in cancer progresses with time.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The H19/Igf2 cluster is paternally imprinted. This means the imprint control region (ICR) on the paternal allele is methylated, which prevents CTCF, an insulator protein, from binding. Without CTCF  binding  the enhancers are free to activate the Igf2 gene. The methylation also spreads to the H19 promoter silencing it.On the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated, which allows CTCF to bind to it. This insulation prevents the enhancers from activating Igf2. The enhancers now work on H19 instead to enhance its expression. In Wilm's tumour the normally inactive Igf2 gene is activated accompanied by hypermethylation of the maternal ICR and de novo methylation and silencing of the maternal H19 allele - effectively mimicking a paternal epigenotype. Igf2 is an oncogene, it promotes growth. If imprinting is disrupted by allowing for two activated genes, too much growth happens which can contribute to cancer. With two active Igf2 alleles there is an increased amount of insulin-like growth factor 2 which may stimulate the 
growth of tumour cells and prevent damaged cells from being destroyed.  Disruption in H19 expression has been identified in several cancers pointing to it being an oncogene or an oncofetal gene, genes that have the potential to cause cancer.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. By inhibiting DNMT1, decitabine causes DNA hypomethylation. In this way it is altering the epigenome.  It is a nucleoside analogue that gets incorporated into the DNA on replication. When DNMT1 comes along it gets bound to the nucleoside analogue and can no longer be released. It is dependent on DNA replication and because cancer cells replicate more rapidly than other cells in the body they are affected more.  The hypomethylation reactivates epigentically silenced tumour suppressor genes i.e. it increases the activation of genes that have an anti-tumour action.We don't know at this stage if this is the only mechanism of action for this drug.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is one type of epigentic modification. Epigenetic modifications are mitotically heritable - this means the way they alter the gene expression of a cell is heritable and therefore has an enduring effect on gene expression.  Once an epigentic modification is put in place it will usually endure unless the cell is reprogrammed during a sensitive period or altered by influences in the environment e.g. diet. stress, exposure to chemicals, ageing.  So this his how drugs that alter DNA methylation could have enduring effects lasting beyond the drug treatment. Sensitive periods are those periods when epigentic marks are being established or being actively reprogrammed. They include the period from primordial germ cell development to the production of mature eggs and sperm and the period from pre-implanation to early post-implantation. During these periods the epigenome is vulnerable to being detrimentally altered by the environment. An epigentic drug could act as environmental insult during these periods, interfering with essential epigentic reprogramming and laying down aberrant epigenetic marks and/or removing marks.<br /><br /></div>
