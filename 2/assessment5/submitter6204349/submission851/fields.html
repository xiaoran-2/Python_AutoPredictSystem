    <div class="field-value">In normal cells CpG islands are usually unmethylated and this allows the transcription of genes. In cancer cells, the CpG islands become hypermethylated and silence the transcription of genes. The methylation of CpG islands can prevents the expression of tumor suppressor genes or growth suppressor genes which allows the unregulated growth of cancerous cells. The intergenic and repetitive regions of normal cells are methylated. The hypomethylation seen in repetitive regions in cancer cells leads to an increase in genomic instability. Transposable elements are moved through the genome and insertions, deletions and translocations occur in the chromosomes. This genetic instability contributes to cancer by over or under expressing cancer related genes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Changes in methylation related to gene imprinting can contribute to cancer. In the H19/Igf2 cluster the maternal allele is unmethylated which allows the insulator to bind to the imprint control region and prevent expression of Igf2, and cause the expression of H19. In the paternal allele, the H19 transcription start and ICR are methylated. The paternal allele causes the expression of Igf2 and silences expression of H19. When the maternal ICR region becomes methylated as seen in Wilm's tumor, the maternal allele behaves the same as the paternal allele. This causes overexpression of Igf2 and underexpression of H19, since both of these genes are related to growth and development abnormal expression leads to abnormal cell growth and cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine changes the epigenetics of a cell by inhibiting DNA methyltranferase (DNMT). The inhibition of DNMT causes hypomethylation across the genome. Since CpG islands are hypermethylated in cancer cells and cause decreased expression of related genes, treatment with decitabine can reduce this hypermethylation and return cells to a normal state. By reverting the epigenetics to a normal state an increase expression in tumor suppression genes can take over and cause the death of the cancer cells. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The changes made by a drug that alters DNA methylation can extend beyond the time that the drug is administered. Changes in methylation can can alter expression levels of genes. For example drugs that decrease expression of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) could cause more regions of the genome to become hypomethylated. The effects of decreased DNA methylation would persist even after treatment with the drug was completed. Due to the possible long term changes to the epigenome, care should be taken in administering epigenetic drugs during sensitive developmental periods. The epigenome is particularly sensitive during early embryonic development when maternal and paternal epigenomic markers are reset, another sensitive period occurs during the development of primordial germ cells and finally prepubescence is sensitive period, although less so. These sensitive periods involve large scaled changes in the epigenetic markers of the entire organism or particular cells types, especially germ cells. If drugs altering epigenetic enzymes were administered during a sensitive period, these development processes of epigenetic marking would be disrupted. These disruptions could be fatal, lead to sterility or cause other diseases including cancer. </div>
