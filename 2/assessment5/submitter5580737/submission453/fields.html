    <div class="field-value">.Generally, DNA methylation of promoter regions inversely correlates with gene expression Exceptions are CpG islands, which are found in about 60% of promoters<span>. They have a high CpG density and are usually kept free of methylation independent of their activity state </span><span>. However, in cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene </span>. In cancer however the mutation or the other protein binding to the CpG island obstructs from the methylation of the DNA. Subsequently the suppressed gene starts expressing.If it happens to an oncogene, it overexpresses than normal scenario resulting in the unlimitel cell division leading to cancer.However this upregulation needs to be supplemented with the other changes in the other genes, may be another oncogen or tumor suppressor gene, and that may ultimately leads to cancer. The perturbation of the gene expresion due to the deregulation of the CpG island methylation hence plays crucial part.Intragenic methylation is found at repetitive sequences such as satellite repeats and remnants of retroviral insertions such as LINEs and SINEs in human DNA. Hypomethylation arises mainly from loss of methylation at normally heavily methylated repeat elements, including satellites (e.g., SAT2) and retrotransposons (e.g., LINEs), leading to genomic instability and oncogene activation. Locus-specific hypermethylation usually occurs at promoter CGIs of tumor suppressor genes, resulting in heritable transcriptional silencing. Methylation of DNA may itself physically impede the binding of transcriptional regulators to the gene,<span>and more importantly, methylated DNA participates in the formation of chromatin through interactions with various other epigenetic modifications such as the histone code, polycomb complexes, nucleosome positioning, noncoding RNA, and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling proteins.the disruption of DNA methylation in ingtergenic regeion and repetative elements contributes in causing cancer.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) are associated with many imprinted genes. In mice methylation at a DMR upstream of the <i>H19</i> gene known as the Imprint Control region (IC1) is acquired in the male germline and influences the methylation status of DMRs 100 kb away in the adjacent Insulin-like growth factor 2 (<i>Igf2)</i> gene through long-range interactions. <br />In humans, germline-derived or post-zygotically acquired imprinting defects at IC1 are associated with aberrant activation or repression of <i>IGF2</i>, resulting in the congenital growth disorders Beckwith-Wiedemann (BWS) and Silver-Russell (SRS) syndromes, respectively. In Wilms tumour and colorectal cancer, biallelic expression of <i>IGF2</i> has been observed in association with loss of methylation at a DMR in <i>IGF2.</i> This DMR, known as DMR0, has been shown to be methylated on the silent maternal <i>IGF2</i> allele presumably with a role in repression. The effect of <i>IGF2</i>DMR0 methylation changes in the aetiology of BWS or SRS is unknown.<br />The presence of IGF2 RNA expression when H19 RNA was downregulated provides further evidence that IGF2 expression is tightly coupled to and dependent on the absence of H19 expression. As well, the loss of H19 in adrenal cancers may be indicative of tumor suppressor activity by H19, leading Gao <i>et al.</i> to suggest that the loss of H19 and subsequent gain of IGF2 may be involved in adrenal cancer induction .<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span><br /></span><p>Decitabine is a member of a new class of drugs known as DNA "demethylating" agents.  Methylation of DNA is a major mechanism that regulates gene expression in cells.  When there is an increase in DNA methylation this can result in the blockage of the activity of "suppressor genes" that regulate cell division and growth.  When suppressor genes are blocked, cell division becomes unregulated, allowing or promoting cancer. </p><p>Decitabine's anticancer effects are believed to be twofold.   One way that it works is by demethylation or interfering with the methylation of DNA.  By this process of demethylation, normal function to the tumor suppressor genes is restored, thus restoring control over cell growth.</p><p>Decitabine also belongs to the category of chemotherapy called antimetabolites.  Antimetabolites are very similar to normal substances within the cell.  When the cells incorporate these substances into the cellular metabolism, they interact with a number of targets within the cell to produce a direct cytotoxic effect that causes death of rapidly dividing cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><br />Altering DNA methylation either naturally during cancer or by any drug usually persist long afterwards.it changes the molecualr and the signalling network that leads to the methylation and other epigenetics change which endures for long even after the drug has been stopped.<br />The sensitive period of the development is the stage when new born infant going through developmental changes that affects the formation of there respective organs as well as the compatible function of each organs. The brain develops in this stage , as well as the limbs and other organs. It is highly important and sensitive to any external stimuli, be it a food, or any chemical or any drug or whatever. It impacts the development as it changes the epigenetics changes in the organs of development which make a life long lasting impression. Hence any negative stimulus in this stage is highly detrimental for the development of the baby into a normal one. As we are not aware of ALL the functions of the drugs, they might have an impact on the normal development of the baby, and hence inadvisable to use at the sensitive period.</div>
