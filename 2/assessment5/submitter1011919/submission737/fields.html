    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value">

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:normal;"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;">The CpG islands are normally
hypomethylated, and usually act as promoters, allowing (promoting) transcriptions
of the associated gene. In cancer,CpG islands are frequently hypermethylated,
generally preventing expression of the associated gene. The effects are different
depending on which gene is prevented being expressed. If, for example, a growth
suppressor gene is under-expressed, cancer cells grow and divide more
than is normal.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:normal;"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;"><span> 
</span>The intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated;
this keeps the DNA unavailable and less likely find homologous sections of
other similar DNA strands to make deletions, reciprocal translocations,
duplications etc, as this is highly repetitive DNA. In cancer, they are unmethylated, and thus they are available to do the above chromosomal manipulations, which could
change the way gene intron is read directly, or disrupt or duplicate a promotor,
or add other promoters in areas not originally having one, perhaps causing transcriptional interference to a neccessary gene expression, causing <span> </span>abnormal transcription of normal genes.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span> The paternal allele is methylated at ICR,
making it unavailable for binding of the CTCF (enhancer blocker) protein, and
allowing the Igf2 cluster to be accessible to the enhancers, and thus
expressed.  The maternal allele is
unmethylated at the imprint control region, allowing binding of the CTCF
protein, and this insulates the Igf2 cluster from effect of the enhancers, thus
turning off expression of Igf2.</span></p>

<p><span>In Wilm’s tumor, imprinting disruption causes
2 functional copies or doses of the paternal allele. This happens for  various reasons, ( whether due to abnormal
epigenetic imprinting control region methylations, DNA mutations or
rearrangements, or uniparental disomy, The duplicate dose of the product Igf2
gene, which is a growth promoter or a tumor growth factor, contributes to the
abnormal growth characteristic of cancer .</span>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine
is a DNA Methyl transferase inhibitor. DNA methylation is decreased when the
Decitabine blocks function of the DNMTI. One would expect the impact to be on
both the promoters of genes, which are usually supposed to be methylated, thus
correcting the ‘cancer’ condition of hypermethylation, and on the repetitive
elements, which are supposed to be methylated, and in that case, may be
expected to cause worsening of the hypomethylation of the repetitive regions,
potentially.</p>

<span>Because this enzyme works on dividing DNA,
(normally to duplicate the methyl groups on the DNA template strand onto the
new copy), it works on dividing cells, and since tumors are actively dividing,
prevents DNA methylation of the new cells being made</span><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li><span>Altered
     DNA methylation patterns in ICR and repetitive are maintained mitotically, thus having
     enduring effects on daughter cells.  .
     Another mechanism that will allow continuing or worsening effects on DNA because of hypomethylation  in the
     repetitive regions are that any </span>translocations, deletions, additions would be expected to be continued mitotically. These DNA changes can effect the epigenetic
     machinery as well, by causing mutations/deletions/phase shifts in the
     actual proteins effecting epigenetic control. </li><li>Increased sensitivity to other chemotherapeutic agents
     might occur if, the euchromatinized hypomethylated repetitive regions
     are more available to the chemo agent..<br /></li><li><span>Sensitive periods are times when a lot of
     specific methylation and demethylation goes on. If disrupted can
     lead to changes in development or imprinting, not just in one generation,
     but subsequent ones. Early embryonic development phase and  Germ cell development phase are most obvious. Globally promoting or preventing methylation during
     these periods might act against the important phases of specific
     methylation/demethylation required for parental imprinting, or specific
     tissue development, or X inactivation, for example.</span></li></ul><p> </p>
