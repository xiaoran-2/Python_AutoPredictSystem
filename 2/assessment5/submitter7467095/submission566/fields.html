    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are often
located at gene promoters, and DNA methylation at CpG islands results in gene
silencing. Methylation of CpG islands increases normally as we age (which may
be one reason that the older we get, the more likely we are to have  cancer). More importantly, hypermethylation at CpG islands
increases throughout the development of cancer, with low levels of methylation
in normal tissue, increasing levels in hyperplastic and neoplastic tissues, and
high levels in metastatic cancers. Since DNA methylation at CpG islands results
in gene silencing, when CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes are methylated,
these genes are not expressed, and therefore can no longer prevent tumor growth.
Often, not only are the CpG islands hypermethylated, but the CpG island shores
(2 kb surrounding CpG islands) of tumor suppressor genes are hypermethylated,
which also contributes to silencing gene expression. Interestingly, CpG island
hypermethylation of specific tumor suppressor genes is often the hallmark of specific
cancers. </p>

<p><span>On the other hand, DNA is normally
methylated at intergenic regions and repetitive elements. This DNA methylation is
important in maintaining genomic integrity. In the absence of DNA
methyltransferases (involved in DNA methylation), chromosomal abnormalities –
insertions, deletions and reciprocal translocations – occur. Methylation at
intergenic regions is believed to prevent aberrant initiation of gene
expression at internal promoters or aberrant splicing; and methylation of
repetitive elements prevents transposition. In all cancer types,
hypomethylation of these regions is found more consistently than genetic
mutation. As expected, many cancers also display genomic instability, and these
chromosomal aberrations often increase as the cancer progresses. These changes
can result in decreased expression of tumor suppressors (through gene deletion
or translocation to regions in which gene expression is repressed) and
increased expression of oncogenes (through gene duplication or translocation to
regions in which gene expression is enhanced). </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 gene cluster includes,
in addition to these two genes, an imprint control region (ICR), a binding site
for CTCF and downstream enhancers. </p>

<p><span style="font-size:14.399999618530273px;">The paternal allele is methylated at
the ICR, preventing CTCF binding; CTCF is an insulator protein that
blocks the effect of downstream enhancers. Since CTCF can’t bind,
methylation spreads to the H19 promoter, and H19 is not expressed on the paternal
chromosome. The absence of CTCF allows the downstream. enhancers to access and
activate expression of Igf2 on the paternal chromosome.</span></p>

<p>The maternal ICR for the H19/Igf2
gene cluster, on the other hand, is NOT methylated. CTCF therefore is able to
bind to the DNA, and H19 is expressed. CTCF blocks the effect of the enhancers
on Igf2 gene expression.</p>

<p>Thus, in normal cells, there is
mono-allelic expression of two genes: the paternal chromosome expresses Igf2,
and the maternal chromosome expresses H19.<br /></p>

<p>In Wilm’s tumor, there is
hypermethylation of the ICR in the H19/Igf2 gene cluster. Thus, both
chromosomes function as if they were paternal chromosomes, so there is
overexpression of Igf2 and no H19 is produced. Expression of Igf2 is growth
promoting and thus contributes to the development of this kidney cancer in young
children.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, once an
epigenetic drug alters DNA methylation, this effect will be passed on to other
cells through mitosis. Epigenetic markers are reset during sensitive periods,
either in embryogenesis or gametogenesis. Epigenetic markers can be broken down
into three basic categories: 1) both paternal/maternal genomic markers are
reprogrammed  in early development of
the fertilized egg, and then reset again in primordial germ cell development;
imprinted genes are reprogrammed only in germ cell development; and
3) repeat regions are not reprogrammed. </p>

<p>Additional sensitive periods in which altered environmental
factors (such as diet, chemicals, or maternal care) also exist; these sensitive
periods tend to impact germ cell development, so the effects are seen in the
offspring. </p>

<p>Examples of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance
suggest that there are additional sensitive windows (such as the “slow growth
period” prior to puberty), but these sensitive times may all be associated with
gametogenesis. </p>

<p>Treating patients with epigenetic drugs during sensitive
periods is inadvisable because the altered epigenetic markers could adversely
impact the patient’s subsequent offspring.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating
agent, which removes methyl groups from DNA. As tumors develop and progress,
DNA methylation increases. Often, theses hypermethylated regions, which
effectively turn off DNA expression, affect expression of tumor suppressors. By
demethylating DNA with Decitabine, tumor suppressors are turned back on, so
they can effectively suppress tumor growth and spreading.</span></p></div>
