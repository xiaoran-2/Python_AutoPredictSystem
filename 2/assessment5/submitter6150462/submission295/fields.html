    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are mostly located around promoter of housekeeping genes other genes frequently expressed in a cell. Hence, CpG islands play an important role in transcriptional initiation. In normal cells, CpG islands are unmethylated state. DNA methylation at CpG islands is essential for normal development, chromatin organization, X-chromosome inactivation and genomic imprinting. In cancer, CpG island-associated tumor suppressor genes are abnormal hypermethylated, which resulting in transcriptional silencing and ultimately promoting<span> carcinogenesis. </span><br /><br />DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is essential for genomic stability. In normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated;however, these regions are abnormal hypomethylation in cancer, which resulting in genomic instability. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normal condition<br />Maternal allele: Imprinted control region is unmethylated and bound to CTCF. Enhancer act on H19. Igf2 expression is silenced. <br />Paternal allele: Imprinted control region is methylated. Enhancer is able to act on Igf2. So, the Igf2 status is expressed.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumor<br />Lost of imprinting causes an overexpression of growth promoting gene Igf2. The imprinted control region of maternal allele is hypermethylated, so the Igf2 expression is double (from paternal&amp;maternal allele), comparing to normal cells, which resulting in enhancing carcinogenesis.   <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is hypomethylating agent. Decitabine hypomethylate DNA through inhibiting DNA methyl transferase. In myelodysplastic syndrome, there is abnormal hypermethylated DNA. The anti-tumor effect of Decitabine is hypomethylating the abnormal DNA.    </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>- Epigenetic changes are reversible. In addition,epigenetic changing is inherited. It is passed to daughter and granddaughter cells during division of cells until they are actively ceased. Hence, it might be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growth without having to kill all its cells, which eventually made cell more susceptible to conventional chemotherapy.<br />- Sensitive period is the epigenetic reprogramming periods which is early embryonic development and primordial germ cell development. These periods are inadvisable because the patient's genome are sensitive to environmental influence. </span></div>
