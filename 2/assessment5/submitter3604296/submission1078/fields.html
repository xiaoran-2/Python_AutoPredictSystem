    <div class="field-value">In cancer the analysis of DNA methylation shows disruption of normal methylation pattern. The normal cell shows hypomethylation of CpG islands and methylation of introgenic regions. The repetitive elements are also heavily methylated which prevents the "jumping gene" effect, which would potentially disrupt normal genes function. Instead, in cancer cells the opposite picture is observed: the CpG islands are methylated and the introgenic regions are demethylated. The methylation of CpG islands silences the tumor suppressor genes. The hypomethylation of intergenic regions and specifically the repeats leads toward potential disruption of the protein synthesis, creating gene "cutouts" by forming promoters in gene intronic regions. The hypomethylation of repetitive regions leads to gene instability since the open repeats create recombination errors in mitosis which leads to chromosomal misalignments, loss of chromosomes of amplifications of genome regions. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The disruption of imprint control regions may happen due to hypermetilation or hypomethylation. Both of this conditions may cause either loss of expression on both alleles or double gene dosage. The phenotypical consequences depend on the actual ICR. As an example, In normal cell the H19/lgf cluster is methylated on paternal allele and unmethylated on maternal allele. This means the paternal allele will be expressed and maternal will be silenced. Here are the epigenetic mechanisms which are leading to this state: the unmethylation allows binding to this region (since the DNA is not compacted) but lgf2 will be silent, so there will not be the gene expression. since the enhancers will bind to H19 which will act as an insulator. In paternal allele the ICR region is methylated, which essentially makes it transparent for enhancers to bind to lgf2 region, thus expressing the lgf2 gene. Phenotype would get one dosage of the gene. In cancerous cell, both ICR regions are methylated, which cases enhancers to act similarly on both alleles, expressing the lgf2 for maternal and paternal alleles, generating an overdose of lgf2 gene. Apparently it adversely impacts the phenotype by creating tumor. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The Decitabine grug developed by Japanese company Eisai, belongs to the class of DNA demethylating agents. The creation of the drug was a result of attempts of blocking the activity of Myc gene, which encodes the transcription factor involved in expression of about 15% of human genes. The researchers then found, that the Myc can be silenced indirectly by blocking BRD4, one of the Myc collaborators. That lead to creation of the drug that causes the hypomethylation by inhibiting DNA Methyltransferase. Contrary to another similar drug Azacitidine, which incorporates in both DNA and RNA, Decitabine incorporates only to DNA. The drag causes the depletion on DNMT1, thus it is targeting the de-methylation of CpG islands to restore the expression of tumor suppressor genes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The advantage of Epigenetic drugs is that the DNA methylation creates strong carbon bonds and mitotically heritable. Therefore, the right epigenetic correction would lead to the proliferation of those changes among the dividing cells. One more thought that comes to my mind is that the cancerous cells are dividing abnormally, whereas the live span of normal cells are regulated by proper activity of tumor suppressor and/or growth inhibiting genes. In that sense the epigenetic drugs seems to be specifically attractive because they should not highly affect the healthy cells. The sensitive periods are defined as <span>epigenetic mechanisms in early life, that include DNA methylation, chromatin changes through histone modifications and ncRNAs. These are transitional periods which are characterized by epigenetic instability, during which any epigenetic influence may cause unpredictable outcome, that's why it should not be advisable to perform any epigenetic treatment during the sensitive period.</span></div>
