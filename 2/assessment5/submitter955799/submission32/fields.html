    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation normally can result in the silencing of
genes by interrupting the normal process of promoters. CpG islands are often
hypermethylated and thus the gene which may regulate cell proliferation is
silenced. This may result in uncontrolled cell growth. For example genes
controlling MYC are not produced and MYC may then result in excess cell cycle
proliferation. Methylation is hypermethylated in the regions of intergenic
regions and in repetitive elements and this hypermethylation silences these regions
and facilitates normal cell DNA transcription of the gene. Disruption of DNA,
namely hypomethylation, in the intergenic and repetitive regions may result in
possible loss of imprinting. This hypomethylation is also related to the
production of lncRNAs which may in turn interfere with normal gene
transcription. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the Igf2/H19 region in a normal state the paternal ICR is
methylated and thus the activators act on Igf2. In contrast in the maternal
allele the activators allow for an expression of H19 and Igf2 is not expressed.
However in cancer the maternal ICR may become hypermethylated as well and this
results in a substantial increase of Igf2 a growth proliferation gene. In Wilms
Kidney tumor this specific type of hypermethylation of the maternal ICR results
in excess Igf2 production and thus tumor proliferation. In addition there is no
H19 produced.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor. Namely, it inhibits the DNA
methyltrasferases that facilitate methylation (such as DNMT3 which are de novo
and DNMT1 which is maintenance). Decitabine thus has then tendency on the
specific hematologic cell lines in MDS to remove methylations which have caused
the aberrant cell line proliferations and allow for the return of homeostasis.
MDS is a quasi-malignant condition originating in the bone marrow which may in
many cases result in Acute Myelogenous Leukemia. With the use of decitabine or
a similar DNMTI azacitibine, demethylation of these rapidly reproducing cells
may be achieve and possible a normal state of homeostasis achieved.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The use of pharmaceuticals that alter the methylation
patterns of DNA can have lasting effects because those patterns may last
through subsequent mitotic changes. On the one hand that may be beneficial as
is the case with MDS but such broad demethylation may also alter other segments
of the DNA altering essential control elements and pathways. In cell
development there are two sensitive periods; germ cell development and early
embryonic development. It is during these periods that methylation is cleared and
reset and that a drug like a DNMTI would pose a serious risk to the proper
resetting of the marks and could result in substantial DNA expression damage.</p>
