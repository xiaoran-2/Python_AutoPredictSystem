    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at CpG islands is associated with epigenetic phenomena like imprinting, X chromosome inactivation etc. However, in case of CpG islands associated with promoters, DNA methylation leads to down-regulation of the associated genes. In cancerous cells, CpG islands of promoters tend to get hypermethylated which leads to silencing of the specific gene. CpG island methylation increases with time as the cells progress from normal state to neoplasia. If the CpG islands in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes are hypermethylated, their expression is decreased and consequently, indiscriminate cell proliferation occurs which leads to cancerous phenotype. CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) is observed in cancers where CpG islands of a set of genes are frequently methylated.<br />In normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements have DNA methylation which maintains genomic stability by preventing illegitimate recombination between repeats and activation of repeats. In cancerous cells, deletion or mutation of DNA methyltransferases leads to hypomethyation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements. This leads to genomic instability because of illegitimate recombination, transposition of repeats, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes.. The resulting abnormal karyotype (deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations) contributes to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Alteration of DNA methylation of imprint control regions (ICRs) leads to loss of imprinting. They can be either hypermethylated or hypomethylated, which can result in over-expression of growth promoting genes or loss of expression of growth suppressing genes.<br />The H19/Igf2 cluster is paternally imprinted. In the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated and this prevents binding of the insulator protein CTCF at the ICR. In the absence of CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter, silencing it. Enhancers can therefore access Igf2, thereby activating it. In the maternal allele, the ICR is not methylated, so CTCF can bind and this causes insulation of the Igf2 promoter from the downstream enhancers. The enhancers, in this case, promote the transcription of H19 gene.<br />In the H19/Igf2 cluster, hypermethylation of the ICR leads to loss of imprinting in Wilm's tumour. The ICR in the maternal allele is also methylated, leading to the expression of Igf2 from the maternal allele as well. In other words, both alleles act as paternal allele. This is cancerous since Igf2 promotes cell growth and over-expression of this protein will lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methytransferase inhibitor (DNMTi). It is used for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome progressed to acute myeloid lymphoma (AML). DNMT inhibitors are nucleoside analogues, which act by irreversibly binding to DNMTs, after they are incorporated into DNA. Hence, the action is replication dependent. At high doses, DNMT inhibitors are toxic and act in a non-specific manner. However, at very low doses, they have an anti-neoplastic effect. The long term effect on normal cells is not yet known. In cancerous cells, there is DNA hypermethylation at the CpG islands in the promoter regions of many genes, including tumour suppressor genes, which leads to silencing of these genes and subsequently, tumour formation. DNMT inhibitors like Decitabine can have anti-tumour effect by reducing the methylation at the promoters of these genes, thereby reactivating them.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic effects like DNA methylation are mitotically heritable, i.e. they are passed on to subsequent generations until they are actively erased. After erasure, the epigenetic marks do not return. Thus, changes in DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome. Since the drugs targeting DNA methylation are used throughout the system, they have the potential to affect every cell, including normal cells. The effect of these drugs is maximum during sensitive periods of development. A sensitive period is a time interval during which the cells of the body are most susceptible to environmental stresses and other changes. In development, the sensitive periods are those during which epigenetic marks are reprogrammed and also, during the stage before puberty when germ cells are still undergoing maturation. Treating patients during sensitive periods, for example pregnant women and younger patients, would be inadvisable since it would lead to alteration of the epigenetic makeup of the genome permanently. Essential epigenetic marks may be removed during treatment which can lead to severe side effects in the patients and also, in the subsequent generations.</div>
