    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands restults in silencing of gene expression. CpG islands in cancer cells are typically hypermethylated. Hypermethylation of these cells acts as an alternative to genetic mutations in cancer, for example this hypermethylation can lead to silencing of tumour suppressor genes. Methylation in intergenic regions and of repetitive elements plays a role in genomic stability and prevents transciptional interference. In cancer, the CpG islands are methylated and the intergenic regions/repetitive elements are hypomethylated.  This in turn lead to creates instability and allows for deletions, reciprocal translocations and insertions, which leads to abberrant growth and cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Methylation of the ICR on the paternal allele allows for activation and expression of Igf2 from downstream enhancers. On the otherhand, methylation of CTCF on the maternal allele results in the CTCF protein binding and insulating Igf2 from downstream enhancers. Wilms tumours occur in Beckwith Wiedemann Syndrome when the maternal allele behaves like the paternal allele.  Meaning the ICR of both the maternal and paternal allele becomes methylated, and the result is an upregulation of the Igf2/H19 cluster (promotes cell growth) and a loss of CdKnlc (tumour supressor). Loss of imprinting can result due to a mutation or deletion, uniparental disomy, or (rarely) epigenetic disruption.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent and is used to inihit DNA methyltransferases (DNMT).  Decitabine inhibits DNA methyltransferase by inversibly binding DNMT once they are incorporated into DNA, which in turn prevents DNA methylation in newly dividing cells. The hypomethylation of the DNA results in apotosis of the cells, and because cancer cells are rapidly dividing, they are more severly affected by Decitabine than normal cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable (DNA methylation markers will remain until they are actively erased). The sensitive period is when DNA can undergo epigenetic reprogramming.  There are two "sensitive" periods, one during primordial germ cell development and the other during early development. Treating patients during these sensitive periods would be inadvisable because of the fact that any epigenetic changes that occur during these periods would have lasting effects, not only for the patient, but also for future generations (trangenerational epigenetic inheritance).</div>
