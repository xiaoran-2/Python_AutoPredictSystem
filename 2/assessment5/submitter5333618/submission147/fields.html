    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands have
been found in about 40% of promoters region of mammalian genes.In normal cell,
CpG islands are usually hypomethylation. However in cancer cells, CpG islands
tend to become hypermethylation that would silence the expressions of the
genes.  Usually the genes are tumor
suppressor genes. And when tumor suppressor genes are inactive, the cancer
could be caused.</p>

<p>DNA methylation also can be found in intergenic regions and
repetitive elements. It is hypermethylation in intergenic regions and
repetitive elements in normal cell. The function of hypermethylation on these
regions is to maintain genomic stability. In cancer cell, these regions tend to
become hypomethylataed. So, the genomic stability is disrupted and illegitimate
recombinations between chromosomes, loss of chromosome or gain of chromosome
can occur. These mistakes can cause many problems, such as active an oncogene,
or inactive a tumor suppressor gene, eventually cancer is caused.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On H19/Igf2 cluster, H19 region is an imprinting-control
region that is controlled by DNA methylation. H19 region is methylated on
paternal allele, so H19 is silenced and CTCF protein can’t bind to this region.
Therefore, the enhancer from the downstream of H19 can interact with the
promoter of paternal Igf2. Igf2 is expressed on paternal allele.</p>

<p>On maternal allele, H19 region is unmethylated and H19 is
expressed. So, CTCF protein can bind to this imprinting control region to
prevent the enhancer from downstream of H19 to contact with the promoter of
Igf2. Igf2 is silenced on maternal allele.</p>

<p>In Wilm’s tumor, there is a hypermethylation of H19
imprinting region on maternal allele as well. Igf2 is also expressed on
maternal allele. So the cancer cells have the double dose of Igf2 in comparison
with normal cells. Igf2 usually support normal cellular growth, but over expression
of Igf2 will cause the dysfunctions of other genes and moreover global
chromatin instability and finally tumor will occur.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. It  hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA
methyltransferase (DNMT). So it belongs to DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. </p>

<p>There are three kinds of DNA methyltransferase in mammal’s
cells. There are DNMT1, DNMT3A and DNMT3B. DNMT1 recognize hemi-methylation DNA
and restore methylation on both strand. So, DNA methylation is maintained by
DNMT1.</p>

<p>Decitabine is nucleoside analogues. It gets incorporated
into DNA during replication. Therefore it is replication dependent. The
incorporation of Decitabine into DNA inhibits DNMT thereby causing
demethylation in those sequences. As it is replication dependent, the cancer
cells which are dividing much more rapidly than normal cells will be more effectively
affected.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an inactive epigenetic mark. This epigenetic modification generally
represses gene expression and is important for the regulation of cellular
differentiation and development. DNA methylation is associated with histone
modification and they play a crucial role to regulate the function of genome by
changing chromatin architecture. Altering DNA methylation can change the
structure of epigenome.</p>

Epigenetic sensitive period is when the environment
could influence epigenetic makeup. One of the sensitive periods is from
primordial germ cell development to the production of mature eggs and sperm. Another
is the pre-implantation period and early post-implantation period. Both of them
are periods of active remodeling of the epigenome.<br /><p>We should avoid
treating patients with the drugs that alter DNA methylation during these
sensitive periods. As these treatments can interrupt epigenetic
reprogramming<span>. <br /></span></p>
