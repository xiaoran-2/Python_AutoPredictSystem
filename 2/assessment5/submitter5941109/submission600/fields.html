    <div class="field-value">CpG islands, which are promoters of genes tend to be protected from methylation. DNA methylation at CpG island would usually translate to silencing of gene expression. This silencing is achieved by a number of mechanisms which include the formation of repressive chromatin structure, and the prohibition of binding by transcription factors. While these phenomenon occur in normal cells, certain disruption at the CpG island can occur which would result in the development of cancerous cells. This disruption may lead to the activation of oncogenes or the inactivation of tumour suppressors. <br /><br />In cancer, there is hypermethylation of CpG island which silence tumour suppressor genes. Because the tumour suppressor genes are inactivated, the cells continue to divide, evading regulation and resulting in cancer.<br /><br />In normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated (probably hypermethylated) in other to maintain genomic integrity. The methylation of repeats prevents transposition, transcriptional interference, and illegitimate recombination. However, there is a hypomethylation of repeats and intergenic regions in cancerous cells. <br /><br />With hypomethylation of repeats/intergenic intervals, genomic instability ensues. This instability would lead to illegitimate recombinations between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, as well as the activation of cryptic promoters. This active repeats can easily jump around the genome and may consequently prematurely activate a number of oncogenes which will result to the emergence of cancer. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><br />In the H19/Igf2 cluster, the imprint control region (ICR) is methylated on the paternal allele thereby disallowing the binding of CTCF (an insulator protein whose binding prevents interaction of Igf2 with downstream enhancers). In this case, the downstream enhancers gain free access to Igf2 (a growth promoter) on the paternal allele and eventually activates the Igf2 whose expression then becomes obvious. Meanwhile H19 on the paternal allele is kept silent. The maternal allele on the other hand has its ICR unmethylated and CTCF bound. This prevents the interaction of downstream enhancers with Igf2, and as such, Igf2 is not expressed (i.e imprinted), rather, the action of the enhancer is drifted to the H19 long non-coding RNA which eventually leads to the activation and expression of the H19 gene.<br /><br />An abnormality my however occur whereby the ICR of both the maternal and paternal allele become methylated and therefore devoid of CTCF binding. This results in overexpression of Igf2, a situation that implies continuous growth as observed in the childhood kidney tumour called 'Wilm's tumour.' In wilm's tumour, there is loss of imprinting, Igf2 gene on both the paternal and maternal allele are expressed as opposed what is observed in normal cells. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine, a DNA-demethylating agent used for treating Myelodysplastic syndromes (the precursors of acute myelogenuous leukemia) is a DNA methyltransferases inhibitor. Although it's molecular mechanism of action is yet unclear, but it has been shown to establish DNA demethylation. At lower dose, Decitabine shows anti-neoplastic effect (i.e kills tumour cells).<br /><br />The anti-tumour effect of Decitabine is manifest in it's action as a nucleoside analogue. It gets incorporated into the DNA upon replication and bound irreversibly with DNA methyltransferases (DNMT), preventing it from copying methylation to daughter strands. This means the action of Decitabine is division dependent. Therefore, cancers which are actively dividing cells are severely affected. This way, the possibility of tumour emergence is reduced or eliminated.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark that is mitotically heritable. When DNA methylation is laid, it has the ability to pass-on to daughter strand during cell divisions. Therefore, when there is an alteration in the DNA methylation and goes unchecked, it gets to the daughter cells in the altered state. This feature makes an altered DNA methylation to have an enduring effect on the epigenome.<br /><br />Sensitive periods can be defined as the periods during embriogenesis/gametogenesis when marks are established (laid) rather than maintained. It can also be described as a period of development that is susceptible to environmental signals, e.g in vitro culture. Sensitive periods of development occur at premordial germ cell development and at early development (embryogenesis).<br /><br />It is inadvisible to treat patients during sensitive periods in order to avoid adult health problems. Whatever side-effect or epigenetic mistake that may occur might be laid as permanent marks in the embryo or germline which may affect it at a later time in life (adulthood). This is one reason why women in early pregnancy are restricted from taking certain drugs</div>
