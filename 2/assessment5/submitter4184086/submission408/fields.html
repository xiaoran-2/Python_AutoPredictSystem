    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value">The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to decrease gene expression by suppressing promoter function. In cancer, DNA methylation of CpG island is promoters of some tumor suppressor genes, leading to decreased expression of those genes. Normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to keep the part of chromatin in heterochromatin state and to suppress their expressions. In cancer, DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive regions are decreased, leading to genomic instability. For example, when repetitve elements are not methylated and are expressed, then those elements may jump around the genome and may be inserted in tumor suppressor genes, resulting in disruption of the genes. If the repetitive elements are in euchromatin state, then chromatin translocation is more likely to occur, which can lead to activation of an oncogene, which is downstream of a strong promoter of the repetitive elements.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the paternal allele, ICR (imprinting control region) is hypermethylated and H19 is not expressed. Enhancers act on Igf2, leading to Igf2 expression. In the maternal allele, ICU is not methylated and H19 is expressed. CTCF (insulator) binds to ICR, and then enhancers do not act on Igf2. As a result, Igf2 is not expressed. In Wilm's tumor, ICRs in both the paternal and maternal allele are hypermethylated and H19 is not expressed. CTCF cannot bind to ICR, and so enhancers act on Igf2. Because Igf2 is expressed in both paternal and maternal allele, cells are more proliferative.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is an DNMT inhibitor. Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation by DNMT, resulting in decreased DNA methylation. In cancer, CpG islands of some tumor suppressor genes are hypermethylated, leading to decreased expression of those genes. Decitabine can decrease methylation of those tumor suppressor genes and increase their expressions.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is maintained by layers of epigenetic machinery, including DNMT. Because DNA methylation is mitotic heritable, altering DNA methylation can have during effectss on the epigenome.  Sensitive periods is when altered environments have an effect on epigenetic control. During development of mammals, there are two sensitive periods: preimplantation (from fertilization to blastocyst) and primordial germ cell development. During those periods, epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation are erased, with exception of repeats (IAP) and imprinting genes. If epigenetic marks are not properly erased during those periods, then abnormal development can occur. Therefore, treating patients during those sensitive periods would be inadvisable.</div>
