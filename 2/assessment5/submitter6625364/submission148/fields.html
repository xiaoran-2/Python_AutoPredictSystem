    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>As we saw in the first readings , the
methylation of the CpG islands is one of the most important epigenetics
modifications , the normal situation of 
DNA  methylation at CpG islands is
to have hypomethylated this regions. However , in cancer, this CpG islands are
usually methylated, that means the silent of the underlying gene.</span></p>

<p><span> Based on
evidences we can see a density increase of the methylation in the CpG islands from
the normal cell to cancer cell,  also
this methylated can silent some tumor suppressor genes, </span>which<span> lead us to the start
or continuation of
a cancer.</span></p>

<p>On the other hand, we can see that other part of
the genome like introns , intergenic regions and repetitive elements usually
were methylated in normal cell , in contrast with cancer cell that have this
regions hypomethylated (the opposite situation
with CpG islands) and may end up in genetic instability , like a autocopy of
this repeats making “indel mutations “ (insertions and <span>deletions )  , acting as transposons  or activating other genes like oncogenes.</span></p>

<p><span>All of this
“methylation code” have sense when we compare the differences between normal
cell Vs cancer cell under the point of view of 
“nuclear localization/transcription factories – gene
expression/epigenetics marks “ . Because one change in this “code of
methylation “ will produce</span><span> severe physical
changes <span>in the nucleus; for example that the inactive
region of the chromatin become to the active region and vice versa; as we can
see in the fig.3 of the paper “ 
Epigenomics of cancer . Hassier &amp; Egger.” <br /></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>If we lost the imprinting pattern and this control is altered by
overexpression or by silent ,means that could develop in a cancer.</span></p>

<p>In the case of the methylation pattern paternal allele in
relationship with the expression of Igf2 , the imprintin control region (ICR)
is methylated , so CTCF are not going to link with ICR , that’s means that CTCF
can’t block the action of the enhancers with Igf2 gen, and Igf2 are going to be
express.</p>

<p><span>In the case of the maternal allele , the ICR is
unmethylated , so, CTCF can link to this ICR and the enhancers are going to act
on H19 , but not in Igf2 (because the link between enhancers-Igf2 is blocking by
CTCF), resulting in a silent genotype of 
Igf2 gene in the maternal allele.</span> <br /></p><p>In relation to the Wilm’s tumour , If Igf2 is active in the maternal allele
( unusual situation) as a
result of overexpression of Igf2 gen , that are going to develop in a Wilm’s
tumour, this desregulation means an extra gene expression.

</p><p>To conclude, this kinds of ” imprinting lost diseases ” have relation with
growth genes that  occur very early, so that is one of the reason that affect early tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a DNA- demethylating agent so we can assume that this drug
are going to decrease level of methylated region in cancer cells (how we can
saw in the questions 1 and 3, exist a relation between the cancer  cells and the increase of the methylated
density).  The mode of action that I
suppose that Decitabine are going to act is the desmethylation of the genomic
region, ( intergenic regions , repetitive elements) and could produce the
activating of some tumor suppressor genes 
(because as we saw in question 1 : “density increase of the methylation
in the CpG islands from the normal cell to cancer cell,  also this methylated can silent some tumor
suppressor genes”).</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>First of all we need to describe what kinds of drugs
Dr. Baylin used : histone-deacetylase inhibitor and DNA- demethylating agent. With
the DNA- demethypating agent we could reactivate some <span>tumor suppressor genes (that’s
should be a great help against cancer) but also “playing” with the histone code
( we are using demethypating agent and deacetylase inhibitors) we can affect
the accessibility of the DNA , trying  to
break the link between  “</span>nuclear transcription factories – gene
expression/epigenetics marks” (fig. 3 “ Epigenomics of cancer “ ). </p>

<p>If we are using histone – deacetylase inhibitors we can
correct some epigenetic mistake that some epigenetic enzymes may be doing. </p>

<p><span>In relation to  the
sensitive period, we need to remember that the nature of epigenetics mutation
is very different than genetic mutation, in the case of epigenetic mutations usually
are chemical mutations, so we can acts with drugs than modify the nature (and
the effect)  of this chemical links. Why
we shouldn’t traating patients during the sensitive periods? Well, we can
affect others epigenetic mark that are</span> not causing cancer.</p>
