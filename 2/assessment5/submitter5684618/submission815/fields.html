    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation and cancer.<br />The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to switch off the expression of a particular gene. In general, in a normal cell these CpG islands tend to be unmethylated. In cancer, there is locus-specific DNA hypermethylation at CpG islands and CpG island shores of  tumour supressor genes ( in particular) and also at ICRs, imprint control regions. This means leads to silencing of tumour suppressor genes (and these epimutations are more frequently found in cancers than genetic mutations at these tumour suppressor genes) and aberrant tissue growth as imprinted genes often involved in either growth promotion or suppression. Furthermore, CpG island hypermethylation progresses over time and is, therefore, involved in invasion and metastasis of tumours. CpG island hypermethylation is found in all tumours, probably as it is mitotically heritable and very rapidly selected for.<br />The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to provide global genomic stability. In cancer, there is genome-wide DNA hypomethylation of repetitive elements and intergenic regions, leading to genomic instability which then leads to a number of aberrant outcomes seen in cancer. These include: illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition and also activation of cryptic promotors and disruption to neighbouring genes.<br />In addition, in cancer there is hypomethylation of CpG poor promotors (often seen in ICRs), leading to activation of these particular gene. For example with R-RAS, a potent oncogene in gastric cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In cancer, there can be either hypermethylation or hypomethylation in the ICRs and the outcomes depends on the particular ICR and the  genes found in that control region - either way it is loss of imprinting.  Most imprinted genes are involves in either growth promotion or 
suppression. Loss of imprinting means that genes that should display 
monoallelic parent-of-origin specific expression, now either have both parental alleles are 
expressed or they are both silenced.<br />For example the ICR involved in H19/Igf2 cluster.<br />In a normal cell, the maternal allele for Igf2 has an unmethylated ICR, with allows binding of the CTCF to its insulator element, in turn allowing the enhancers to act on H19, and Igf2 is silent. In the normal cell, the paternal allele has a methylated ICR and the enhancers can act on Igf2 as CTCF is not binging to its insulator element to inhibit this.<br />In cancer, e.g. in Wilm's tumour, there is hypermethylation, so instead of only the paternal allele (imprinting) leading to expression of Igf2, the maternal allele is also methylated. This disruption of imprinting means there is effectively a double dose of Igf2 compared to a normal cells and Igf2 is involved in tumour growth promotion.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferance i.e. it is a DNMTi. These are nucleotide analogues that are incorporated into the DNA upon replication, and then bind irreversibly to the DNA methyltransferance, DNMT1, which can no longer be released. DNMT1 comes along during cell division to copy the methylation pattern onto the daughter strand of DNA, that is DNMT1 is division dependent and therefore more targeted at cancer cells that are rapidly dividing. Overall, the mechanism of action for DNMTis are unclear, but they are related to the DNA <strong>demethylation</strong> effect. Decitabine is used for Myelodysplastic syndrome that has progressed to AML (acute myeloid leukaemia) and it is postulated that some haematological malignancies are dependent on tumour suppressor gene hypermethylation. Decitabine can have its anti-tumour effect by countering this hypermethylation (and therefore countering the silencing) of these tumour suppressor genes.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is a mitotically heritable epigenetic mark. Through DNMT, there is replication of these methylation marks onto the daughter strands of DNA during mitosis, so that methylation will persist (in most tissue types) for the lifetime of that organism i,e, it will have enduring effects on the epigenome, lasting beyond the period of drug treatment.<br />A sensitive period in epigenetic terms refers to  periods of epigenetic reprogramming. This clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks occurs in general at two time points. Firstly during early embyronic development, so that between generations, totipotency is restored - this is of relevance for epigenetic cancer treatment in women with reproductive consideration. Secondly, there is epigenetic reprogramming during germ cell development. If patients were exposed to such drugs during this sensitive periods, it would potentially lead to a disruption in epigenetic reprogramming or aberrant reprogramming. The overall outcomes will depend on the function of the genes affected. Imprinted genes would potentially be affected during primordial germ cell development, when these epigenetic marks for imprinting are reset.  Treatment with drugs that alter DNA methylation (and potentially lead to loss of imprinting) during this period may predispose to embryonic/ childhood tumours or syndromes like Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome. <br /><br /></div>
