    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are usually unmethylated  in normal cells unlike intergenic regions and repetetive elements. Conversely, in cancer cells CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated. This may contribute to cancer by silencing tumor supression genes. Hypermethylated state of intergeneic regions and repetative elements helps to maintain transposable elements inactive. Intergeneic regions and repetative elements are often hypomethylated in cancer. This leads to the activation of transposable elements and makes repetative elements more accessible in terms of chromatin condensation. These events may lead to the elevated possibility of improper chromosome recombination that result in reciprocal chromosome translocations, insertions, deletions and in general in genomic instability. Moreover activation of transposable elements may lead to activation of cryptic promoters or to inactivation of genes promoters. This may lead to the disruption of gene expression.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The alterations in DNA methylation within ICR regions in cancer may lead to the loss of imprinted expression of genes regulating cell growth as meny imprinted genes are connected with the growth characteristics. One example of this is H19/Igf2. Normally the H19/Igf2 ICR of the paternal allele is methylated and this results in preventing of CTCF insulator protein binding to the ICR. In this case the distant enhancers may act on Igf2 and trigger its expression from the paternal allele. Conversely, the H19/Igf2 ICR of the maternal allele is unmethylated that allows CTCF to bind to ICR and this insulate distant promoters from Igf2 and thus inhibit its expression.IN Wilm's tumor both paternal and maternal alleles are methylated. This leads to the expression of Igf2 from both alleles, so the imprinting mark is lost. As the result the gene dose of Igf2 in such cells is 2-fold higher than in normal cells. Igf2 is a growth promoting gene and it can contribute to the Wilm's tumor - a specific childhood kidney tumor.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the family of DNA-demethylating agents. Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. It is a nucleoside analogue witch after been incorporated in DNA binds DNA methyltransferase irreversible. So this reduces the maintenance of DNA methylation. It means that the effect of Decitabine is cell-division dependent. As the tumor cells are usually intensively dividing Decitabine will preferentially affect those cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is an inheritable mark, so altering DNA methylation can have enduring effect on the epigenome because those alterations once appeared during the exposure to the drug will be present in all future generations of affected cells. The sensitive periods are those periods when DNA is more succeptible to alterations in DNA methylation than in other periods. These are the periods when epigenetic marks are extensively changing - erasing and emerging. There are two sensitive periods in the development of the organism - early embrionic development stage (when epigenetic marks specific to oocyte and spermatozoid are erased and the marks of pluripotent state are set) and the germ-line development in the embryo when the imprinting marks are rewritten and the specific marks of  oocyte and spermatozoid are set. Treating patients during these sensitive periods (for example pregnant women or children before pubertant pediod) would be inadvisable because it may affect the progeny of those patiens.</div>
