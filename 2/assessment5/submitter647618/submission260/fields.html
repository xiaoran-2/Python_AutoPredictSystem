    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are regions of DNA that contain a high CpG dinucleotide density and are generally located in the promoter region of genes; they are found in approximately 60% of promoters (Hassler MR, Egger G. (2012). Biochimie,
        94(11):2219-30). In normal (versus tumor) cells, they tend to be unmethylated. One of the hallmarks of tumor cells is that CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated; hypermethylation of CpG islands is associated with silencing of gene expression. Thus, CpG island hypermethylation in tumor suppressor genes can act in the same way as a mutation in these genes. For example, in some hereditary cancers associated with mutations in specific genes, RB in retinoblastoma, BRCA1 in breast/ovarian cancer and MLH1 in colon cancer, research has shown that these genes are frequently shut down due to hypermethylation of CpG islands.<br />In contrast to hypermethylation of CpG islands in cancer there is also a global demethylation of CpGs in intergenic regions and repetitive elements; in normal cells these regions tend to be methylated but in cancer cells they are hypomethylated. Hypomethylation progresses with time and starts early in tumor development and ultimately leads to genome instability. Hypomethylation at repetitive elements is a large contributor to genome instabiltiy; when hypothemethylated, the chromatin around repeated elements becomes less compact allowing illigitimate recombination between repeated elements due to the homology between them. Additionally, hypomethylation can lead to activation of transposable elements; transposition can cause disruption or inappropriate activation of other genes by insertions/deletions.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Many imprinted genes are involved in growth regulation and therefore, disruption of imprinting is found in some cancers; this disruption can be due both to hypermethylation or hypomethylation. <br />As an example, hypermethylation is found at the normally imprinted region Igf2/H19 locus in Wilms tumor. Normally, the imprinting control region (ICR) is methylated on the paternal allele but not on the maternal allele. The result is that CTCF, a DNA binding protein, can bind to the ICR on the maternal allele but cannot bind to the ICR on the paternal allele because  it is blocked by methylation. When CTCF binds the ICR, a regional enhancer acts on H19 instead of Igf2,  promoting its expression. On the paternal allele, because CTCF does not bind the ICR, the same enhancer region preferentially activates Igf2 which is a growth factor. However in Wilms tumor, imprinting is disrupted such that both the maternal and paternal alleles are methylated at the ICR, resulting in overexpression of Igf2. Overexpression of Igf2 can lead to tumor formation.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor and thus promotes DNA demethylation. By demethylating DNA, deciatbine can effect a mitotically stable change in DNA. Thus, areas of DNA that are hypermethylated in cancers such as CpG islands can be demethylated and this change will be mitotically stable. As noted in question 1, hypermethylation of CpG islands in tumor suppressor genes is associated with many cancers; thus demethylation of such genes can restore their tumor suppressor capabilities.<br /><span class="_wysihtml5-temp"></span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because it is mitotically stable; DNA methyltransferases such as DNMT1 ensure that DNA methylation marks are propagated through cell division by identifying and methylating hemi-methylated DNA after DNA replication.Epigenetic reprogramming, the celaring and re-setting of DNA methylation marks, occurs during specific periods of development. These "sensitive" periods occur during primordial germ cell development and pre-implantation development.  Because essential epigenetic marks are being laid down during these developmental phases, it would be inadvisable to treat an individual with a drug that inhibits DNA methyltransferases.<br /></div>
