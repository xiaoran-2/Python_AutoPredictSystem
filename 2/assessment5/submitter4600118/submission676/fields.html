    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Under normal circumstances, CpG islands are mostly unmethylated and tend to be protected from methylation.  These CpG islands tend to be at the promoters of genes.  In cancer, these islands become hypermethylated, causing the genes to be silenced.  Some of the silenced genes are tumor suppressors, regulating cell growth and programmed death.  With these regulating genes silenced, affected cells grow uncontrollably, creating a tumor.<br /><br />Repeats and intergenic regions are ordinarily heavily methylated, regulating gene dosage.  In cancer, these regions become hypomethylated, resulting in the unwanted activation of the previously-silenced genes.  Not only does this throw gene dosage out of balance, with frequently oncogenic effects, but the demethylation of repeats can cause genomic instability.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the paternal allele, the imprinting control region (ICR) is methylated.  The methylation blocks the CTCF protein from binding, and the methylation spreads to silence the H19 promoter, allowing the downstream enhancers to activate Igf2.  In the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated, and the CTCF protein binds to the ICR, allowing H19 expression, which prevents the downstream enhancers from activating Igf2.<br /><br />In Wilm's Tumor, the maternal ICR is hypermethylated, silencing H19 and allowing the downstream enhancers to activate Igf2.  This causes double expression of the normally imprinted Igf2.  Because Igf2 promotes growth, the affected cells grow at an unwanted increased rate, creating a tumor.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, (DNMTi)  which means it partially prevents the methylation of DNA.  Genome-wide hypermethylation causes genes to not be expressed, including many tumor-suppressor genes.  Preventing this unwanted methylation will allow continued :"normal" cell growth and development.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The key to DNA methylation's function as an epigenetic control is that it is mitotically heritable. That is, the methylated state is passed from parent to daughter cells.  Drugs that alter DNA methylation will thus not only affect the cells they are directly acting on, but also all the cells that result from further division of those cells.  There are two sensitive developmental periods in which heavy epigenetic reprogramming occurs: Early embryonic development and primordial germ cell development.  During these periods, DNA undergoes rapid de- and re-methylation.  Treating patients with these drugs during these sensitive periods would interrupt this normal and critical process.<br /></div>
