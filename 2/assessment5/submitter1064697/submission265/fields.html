    <div class="field-value"><p><span><b>DNA
methylation at CpG</b> Island maintain genomic stability by silencing gene
expression, in other words ensure that genetically the genome was normal and
didn´t lose or gain chromosome or have illegitimate recombination between them.
 Methylation at CpG Island is an
alternative to genetic to genetic mutation to silencing tumor suppressor gene
(TSG) and it´s known that inactivating of tumor suppressors (and activating oncogenesis)
results in cancer cells.  In normal cells
they are protected from DNA methylation by GC strand asymmetry
accompanying R loop formation and by active demethylation mediated by TET
proteins but in cancer cells they likely to be hypermethylated
what lead to transcriptional repression and loss of TSG, increase the mitotic
recombination events and growth of tumor. In summary a methylated CpG island correspond
to silenced tumor suppressor gene, thus leading to tumor cells growth.</span><span> <br /></span></p><p>On the other hand, in cancer cells, the
intergenic regions and repetitive elements, which maintain genomic integrity by
silencing cryptic transcription start sites and by silencing of repeats and
mutate meC to T to protect genome to transposable element, tend to
be hypomethylated, contrary to the normal cells where they´re hypermethylated
and heterochromatonized.  This hypomethylation
led to the illegitimate recombination between repeats because they are not
densely packaged down in to heterochromatin, they are an open chromatin, so
they can make a copy of themselves and transpose, activating neighboring genes,
resulting in additional deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations,
leading to genomic instability and they end to have a tumor growth. <br /></p><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Genomic imprinted is the differential
expression of the alleles of a gene that is dependent on the parent-of-origin
of the allele.  In the <strong>paternal allele</strong>,
the Imprinted Control Region (ICR) is hypermethylated, prevent CTCF-dependent
insulator to binding and allowing <strong>Igf2</strong> to engage enhancers and silencing <strong>H19</strong>.
At <strong>maternal allele</strong> the ICR is hypomethylated, the CFCF binding to the ICR and
block the Igf2 promoter to access the enhancers and instead promote H19
expression. With loss of imprinting we have a hypermethylation of ICR on
maternal allele as well and expression of the Igf2 gene (a gene that promote
insulin-like growth factor II), making a double dose of Igf2 in comparison to
normal cell.  Overall we have an aberrant
activation of the normal repressed maternally inherited allele, related to
biallelic hypermethylation of the H19. So, this is what happens in <strong>Wilm´s
cancer</strong>, we have a hypermethylation of the ICR in both maternal and paternal and
double expression of the Igf2, which promote cumulative disruption of cellular
growth.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">It has been shown that epigenetic process are susceptible to chemical intervention- they are open to drug treatment. Decitabine, an approved drug is an example. It is  an DNMT inhibitor family of nucleoside analogues used to treat myelodyplastic syndrome, the percursors of acute myolegenous leukemia. Decitabine cause a demethylation of repressor binding site. They get incorporated into DNA upon replication, and them the DNMT came along to bind the nucleoside to them copy the methylation to daughter strand, that DNMT is bond irreversibly and no longer be released, which cause a DNA hypomethylation by silencing cancer suppressor genes in tumor cells. Overall  Decatabine re-establish in a cancer cell a normal chromatin structure by using inhibitor on chromatin modifying enzymes, promoting selectively DNA hypomethylation and open chromatin configuration of a CpG, preventing the uncontrolled cell growth that causes cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Gene silencing at level of chromatin is needed for a life of eukaryotic cells and it is important for biological process, including differentiation, imprinting and gene silencing in X- chromosome inactivation for the life span of females mammals. In vertebrate, it can also account with DNA methylation pattern which is mitotically heritable. So appropriate silencing gene expression by DNA methylation on period of chronic stress and renewal pressure on cell System and active when stem or precursor cells differentiate - period of epigenetic reprogramming, the clearing and resetting of  epigenetic marks - will permanently silence cancer relevant genes both physiologically and pathologically. <br /></div>
