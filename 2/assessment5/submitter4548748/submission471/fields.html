    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value">Because the CpG islands are associated with the promoters of the genes, the methylation state of the CpG islands are connected to the expression of the genes. If the CpG island is methylated, the corresponding gene is silenced, if it is unmethylated the gene is expressed. In cancer cells the CpG islands within the promoters of the cancer suppressor genes are often methylated, resulting the suppression of the suppressor genes. As the suppressors are switched off, the cell easily become a cancer cell as it can be one of the<br />hits in the Knudson hypothesis. As the methylation is associated with the silencing, normally the intergenic regions and the repetitions are silenced by the DNA methylation. But in the cancer cells that regions are lost the methylation, leads the loss suppression. The overall methylation of the DNA is decreasing in the cancer cells as the cancer develops. The active repetitive elements cause genetic instability and increased mutation rates, as the repetitions are disrupts the normal gene pairing and separation during the mitosis.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The binding site of the CTCF and the promoter of H19 gene are differently methylated. In the maternal allele, the site is not methylated allowing the binding of the CTCF, which serves an insulator protein, insulates the igf2 from the downstream enhancer and allow the expression of the H19. In contrast the in the paternal allele the site is methylated, so no CTCF binding, no insulation -&gt; the enhancers can access the Igf2. Moreover the methylation spreads to the promoter of the H19, silencing the gene. <br />As the methylation of the maternal allele changed and methylated like the paternal allele, the CTCF can't bind to the binding site allows the downstream enhancers to reach the igf2 and both the maternal and paternal igf2 become expressed and both H19 are suppressed resulting an increased cell growth. And the increased cell growth can lead to cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">As the methylation of the DNA is changed compared to the normal cells, (hypermethylation of CPG islands, and hypomethilation on overall). the drugs like Decitabine, which act as DNMT inhibitor can have anti tumor effect on the specific stages of the cancer development. As the Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor, it reduces the effect of the DNA methyltransferase resulting the  reduced DNA methylation. The reduced methylation prevent the silencing of the cancer suppressor genes so it can have anti tumor effect. The exact mechanism and the long term effect are not clear yet.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The epigenetic state is stable and inherited through the generation of the cells. So once the epigenetic drugs altered the epigenetic state the tumor cells, the altered state preserved and have long lasting effect. Because the effect of such drugs are not limited to the cancer cells only, all of the cells are effected. There are some sensitive periods, when the epigenetic marks are established or re-established, like germ cell developments, early embryonic developments. During that periods of the development the usage of such drugs are inadvisable, because the drugs can disrupt the epigenetic mark establishments. The germ cell development lasts until the puberty, so the treatments of the children with a such drugs are arguable. But the goal of the treatments is the survival of the patient, the long term (5-10+ years) effect has only a low priority during the treatment.<br /></div>
