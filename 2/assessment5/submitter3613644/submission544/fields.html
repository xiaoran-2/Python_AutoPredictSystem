    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">At GpG island it is usually kept free of DAN methylation. However in cancer, CpG islands are hypermethylated which causes gene silencing. DNA methylation can also target at CpG islands shores, and genes around can also be hypermethylated. Tumor supressor gene underlying at CpG islands can be silenced due to DNA hypermethylation, and hence cancer can grow exponentially. In normal cell, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are inactive (methylated). In cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated and the genes underlying become active. It contributes to cancer by causing genomic instability, such as illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes.   </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The paternal chromosome has imprinted control region that is methylated and not bind with CTCF in normal cells, hence, enhancers are free to act on Igf2 and Igf2 is free to express. In maternal allele, the imprinted control region is bind to CTCF and CTCF is able to insulate Igf2 from downstream enhancers and enhancers will then act on H19 instead of Igf2, hence, Igf2 is silent. However, when the maternal allele goes wrong and forces Igf2 to become active, along with Igf2 expression in paternal allele, Igf2 is overexpressed, and h19 will be also forced to be silent due to its imprinting control region. In cancer, both maternal and paternal have the same epigenesis, where Igf2 both turned on, H19 turned off, which causes tumor cell growth.   </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. The drug is used to inhibit DNA methyltranserase, which stop the transfer of methyl group to DNA and avoid gene inactivation. Decitabine can have an anti-tumor effect when gene such as tumor suppressor gene is hypermethylated. Avoiding methy- group to be transfer to DNA will re-active tumor suppressor gene and slow tumor growth (hence the anti-tumour effect). </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is maintained by DNMT1 and since DNMT1 is mitotically heritable, the epigenetic mark will be "remembered" and passes along to the daughter cell. Sensitive period is when cells are going through epigenetic re-programming. Sensitive periods of development are mainly germ cell development and early embryonic development, which is during female pregnancy and development of sperms at young boys aged around 8-13. During sensitive periods, epigenetic marks will be clear and reset, and the marks will be maintained in daughter cells and pass along to dividing cells. Treating patients during such a period might accidentally erase/obtain vital epigenetic marks that can be maintained throughout the life time and to the next generation.  </div>
