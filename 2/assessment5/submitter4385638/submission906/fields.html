    <h1>Submission 906 from Anon (session_user_id: 6a1c10c34716003adb69ab3339d61450f248b15d)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">CPG islands are normally kept free of methylation independant of activation state<br />CPG islands are normally found at transcription start sites - promotoers<br /> In cancer hypermethylation can lead to inappropriate silencing e.g. tumour suppressors.<br /><br />Methylation of  intergenic regions and and repetitive elements promotes gonomic stability by preventing recombination at these sites. This can also contribute to alternatively spliced variants of genes<br />hypomethylation at these sites therefore leads to caner through inappropriate recombinations, elognations and/or truncations of genes <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprinting can lead to the silencing of either the maternal or paternal allele therefore only a single copy being expressed.<br /><br />In the case of the H19/Igf2 cluster, wild-type conditions see expression from the maternal H19 promoter and the paternal IGF2 promoter only.  The paternal Imprint Control Region (ICR) is methylated on the paternal copy and so does not bind CTCF. CTCF therefore instead binds and transribes the more distal IGF2 gene.<br /><br />The loss of imprinting means that the maternal allele also transcribes IGF2 - generating double the hormone - and hence double the growth - this leads to Wilm's tumour<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demthylating agent. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibitingDNA methyltransferase. It can reduce myelodysplastic syndromes (dysfunction blood cells - such as Leukemias).<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">There are sensitive periods in which genome-wide epigenetic reprogramming occurs - such as pregnancy - especially around fertilization (when there is global erasure and then re-establishment of the epigenome) and germ-line cell reprogramming during early adolescence (where specifically the gamete epigenome is re-set).<br /><br />During these periods the epigenome is susceptible to be changed through environmental or behaivoural factors - such as pesticides (e.g. DES) polcarbonate bottles - BPA; and calorific intake, respectively.<br /><br />Altering epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation can have long-lasting effects on the epigenome as these changes are mitotically heritable and stable.<br /><br />Treating people in these sensitive periods is therefore inadvisable as it could cause disruption of epigenetic programming - leading to abnomalities; including to the germline which could affect indefinite generations to come.<br /><br /><br /></div>
