    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">-DNA methylation at CpG islands function in silencing the gene expression of that particular region.<br />-Most common disruption related to CpG island methylation is the <span>hypermethylation</span>, which means that CpG islands are methylated more than normal.<br />-Well known case is hypermethylation of CpGs around tumor suppressor genes. If tumor suppressors are silenced via abnormal methylation this will have a negative effect on suppression of tumors, and will, in turn, induce tumor formation.<br />-DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements decreases expression of genes and non-coding RNA regions, and therefore secures genomic stability. <br />-In cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated (less methylated compared to healthy cells). This increases the expression of intergenic and repetitive regions of the genome.<br />-Higher expression of intergenic and repetitive regions leads to, a) undesired recombination between repeats, b) increases transposition events, c) leads to disruption of neighboring genes, and most importantly, d) leads to abnormal karyotypes (deletions, insertions of large chromosomal segments, or reciprocal exchanges between non-homologous chromosomes. This genomic instability induces tumor formation, uncontrolled cell division, etc.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">-In normal paternal allele, ICR region of H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated, this prevents CTCF protein from binding to related region, and enhancer regions can induce the expression of Igf2 gene.<br />-In normal maternal allele, ICR region is NOT methylated, and CTCF protein can bing to the intermediate binding site, and prevents enhancer region to physically interact with Igf2. Since enhancer cannot interact and induce Igf2, as a result, in maternal allele Igf2 stays silent (imprinted).<br />-In Wilm’s tumor, ICR region of maternal allele is hypermethylated (increase in methylation profile compared to healthy cells). Enhancers can bind and induce expression of Igf2 gene.<br />-In Wilm’s tumor, imprinting disruption (overexpression of Igf2) leads to over expression of growth promoting genes, and uncontrolled cell division leads to tumor formation.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">- Unfortunately I cannot read The Economist article (it says "<span>You have reached your limit of three articles”), but I will try to answer according to what I have learnt in lectures. Decitabine is a therapeutic agent that belongs to chromatin remodeling inhibitors.</span><br />-Decitabine is a DNA methyl transferase inhibitor (DNMTi)<br />-Decitabine decreases DNA methylation levels in tumor cells by inhibiting DNMTi, and as we know, there are hypermethylation events (especially in tumor suppressor genes) those can increase tumor formation. By inhibiting DNMT protein, overall methylation is expected to decrease, and tumor suppressors may function properly, and inhibit or slow down tumor formation/progression.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">-DNA methylation is mitotically inheritable, thus, any change made at early stages of development have potential to be inherited to different cells and tissues. This are, then, will be long term effects since changes on germ lines with whole genome DNA methylation changes will spread to whole body by mitotic divisions.<br />-Sensitive period is the developmental stages those epigenetic marks are cleared or reset.<br />-Younger patients and germ line cells are sensitive in terms of developmental stages.<br />-The drugs are not specific at the moment, and target epigenetic proteins those have multiple targets. And sensitive periods are the times in which whole cell epigenetic marks are set, or reset, and applying patients at those stages might have indirect consequences.<br /><br /></div>
