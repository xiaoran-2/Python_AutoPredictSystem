    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><span>Usually
there is low DNA methylation at CpG islands in promoters to keep the genes
active. Methylation causes silencing or repressed transcription of genes, and
it occurs e.g. in silencing of the inactive X chromosome and during cell differentiation.<br /></span>

<p>In cancer,
there is hypermethylation of CpG islands. This results from altered expression
or function of proteins involved in the DNA methylation/demethylation. This could
be caused e.g. by point mutations, amplification or translocations in their genes.</p>

The
CpG island hypermethylation silences tumor supressors, such as proteins involved
in control of cell cyclus, apoptose, and DNA repair, and it may therefore lead
to uncontrolled cell division and to cancerous DNA mutations.<br /><br /><span>Intergenic
regions and repetitive elements are usually highly methylated to ensure genomic
stability. Methylation of cryptic splice sites in intergenic regions protects
against  deletions, insertions and
reciprocal translocation, and methylation of long terminal repeats in
transposable elements hinders illegitimate recombination and their transpositions.
 Also, cryptic promoters and strong
promoters in transposable elements are repressed by the methylation.</span><br /><br /><span> In cancer, intergenic and repetitive elements
are hypomethylated, e.g. due to mutations in DNMTs. This causes genomic
instability, which is a hallmark of cancer.</span><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Igf2 is expressed from the paternal allele due to methylation of the
ICR. The explanation is that methylation hinders binding of CTCF, which would
otherwise hinder enhancers to help in Igf2 transcription. Spreading of the methylation to the h19
promoter causes repression of this protein.</p>

<p>Igf2 is not
expressed from the maternal allele, since the ICR is not methylated and the
enhancers therefore are not allowed to work. In contrast, h19 is expressed.<br /></p>

<p>In Wilm’s
tumor, the ICR on the maternal allele is hypermethylated, and Igf2 is expressed
just as on the paternal allele. This causes overexpression of Igf2. Since Igf2
is a growth factor, its overexpression may contribute to tumor growth.<br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine
is a DNMT inhibitor. It is a nucloside analogue that prevent release of DNMT from
DNA during replication, and it therefore causes a genome wide decrease in DNA
methylation and has most impact on highly dividing cells (cancer cells). An
antitumor effect may occur when the cancer is caused by silencing of
tumor-suppressors by CpG island hypermethylation, which can be prevented by the
drug. Though, the exact mechanism of the drug is unclear.<br /></p><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span> A drug that increases DNA
methylation can have lasting effects, since the methylation is mitotically
inheritable through the action of DNMT1, and since the enzyme that can remove
the methyl group is seldomly expressed.</span> If a drug decreases DNA methylation, the DNA hypomethylation will be preserved as well, as there is no de novo methylation in the somatic cells. <br /></p>

<p>A sensitive
period is a period where epigenetic marks are established e.g. during epigenetic
reprogramming where marks are cleared and reset. This occurs in the early
development (zygote, preimplantation embryo) and in the gametogenesis
(primordial germ cells). In these periods, treatment with a drug that alters
the DNA methylation could disturb cell differentiation, and genomic imprints could
be lost. Aditionally, it could lead to infertility.<br /></p><br /><br /></div>
