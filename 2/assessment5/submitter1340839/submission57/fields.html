    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell, CPG islands are hypomethylated, so you don't see methylation in general at CPG islands.<br /><div>In a cancer cell, the CpG islands are more likely to be methylated. Often they're in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes. Since this is mitotically heritable it means, that tumor suppression can be deactivated in these cells and over time these cells are statistically more likely to become prevalent if they do not die as much or divide more rapidly.<div><br />In a healthy cell Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methelated. In a cancer cell they are hypomethylated meaning they are more likely to cause transcription errors. You can have Illegitimate recombination between repeats, reciprocal translocations, copying and transposition due to activation. This can have knock on effects in other genes and also the general demethylation can cause the chromatin to open up.</div></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>In the the paternal allele there is methylation around Igf2 at the Imprint Control Region. <br />In the maternal allele there is no methylation around Igf2 at the Imprint Control Region.</div><div>CTCF binds to the maternal strand and the enhancers activate H19. <br />CTCF does not bind to the paternal strand due to methylation, this deactivates H19 and activates Igf2. </div><div>Regular cells have H19 from maternal strand, and Igf2 from paternal strand.<br /></div><div>Too much Igf2 is generated along with very little H19 and is linked with Wilm's tumor.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating (hypomethylating) agent. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting the DNA methyltransferase protein. <span>This aids in activating tumor suppressor genes that stop cancer cells growing and dividing.</span><span><br />It can be used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.<br /></span><br /> </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can be mitotically heritable meaning that it is preserved through generations of cell division. Therefore the effects can be enduring.<br />A sensitive period is a period of instability where epigenetic reprogramming is taking place by clearing and setting of genetic markers. This happens during formation of gametes, <span>maturing oocytes, </span>fertilization and also in the <span>blastocyst.<br />Treating patients during these periods is a bad idea because it can interfere with the epigenetic reprogramming that must happen in these cells before they turn into gametes or somatic cells, at which point the effects would be enduring and could have serious side effects.<br />It is therefor advisable to not administer these drugs to pregnant mothers, or during ovulation of women seeking to get pregnant. Also males should not seek to conceive while on this medication.</span></div>
