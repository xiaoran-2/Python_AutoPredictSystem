    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine
is a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor and belongs to the class of DNA-demethylating
(hypomethylating) agents. It is used for the treatment of myelodysplastic
syndromes. Decitabine irreversibly binds to DNA methyltransferase when it incorporated
in DNA and prevents DNA methylation. It leads to decrease DNA methylation. Some
tumors (colorectal cancer, gliomas, neuroblastoma and others) are characterized
by DNA hypermethylation including hypermethylation of CpG islands and ICRs that
may play some role in tumor pathogenesis. It is considered that DNA hypermethylation
increases with tumorigenicity. Therefore decreasing of DNA methylation for some
types of tumor may lead to antineoplastic (<span>anti-tumour) effect and treatment of patients.</span><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Disruption
of DNA methylation plays important role in cancerogenesis. CpG
islands are located in promoter parts and take part at regulation of gene
expression. In normal cells they tend to be unmethylated. Methylation of CpG
islands lead to silencing of gene expression. It may also occur dynamically in different
types of normal cells for small number of CpG islands. Cancer cells contain
hypermethylated CpG islands that lead to silencing of the underlying gene. It
may lead to silence tumor suppressor genes in cancer. Tumor suppressor genes take
part at regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis protecting a normal cell against
cancer development. Therefore disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands may leads
to uncontrolled cell division and disturbance of apoptosis. </span>Unusually high frequency of DNA methylation at CpG rich sites was called CIMP (CpG island methylator phenotype).</p>

<p>Intergenic
regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated in normal cells. It leads
to silencing of repeats and prevents their transposition, transcriptional
interference from strong promoters and illegitimate recombination. Intergenic
regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated in cancer. It may leads to activation
of transposons, cryptic promoters, disruption to neighbouring genes and genomic
instability (insertion, deletion and reciprocal translocation of genes or their
parts) in cancer cells. It can also delete Dnmt1 gene that leads to enhance or
suppress tumorigenesis.<br /></p><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;"><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Disruption of
imprinting can contribute to cancer development. It may be shown on the
H19/Igf2 cluster. In this cluster the paternal allele has methylated ICR that blocks
binding of CTCF protein. The maternal allele has unmethylated ICR that allow
binding of CTCF protein. CTCF is an insulator protein, which insulates Igf2 from
downstream enhancers. In the paternal allele (without CTCF), DNA methylation
spreads to H19 promoter that leads to its silence and enhancers can access Igf2
to its activation. Enhancers bind to H19 promoter instead of Igf2 in the maternal
allele. ICR and H19 promoter became to be hypermethylated in the maternal
allele In Wilm’s tumor that prevent binding of CTCF protein and increases enhancer
interaction with Igf2 and its production. Igf2 promotes the growth and proliferation
of cells in many different tissues. Therefore its hyperexpression stimulates
calls to proliferation. Hyperproliferation of cells is one of the features of
cancer cells. </span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;"><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">DNA methylation is
important mechanism of epigenesis because it takes part in epigenetic
reprogramming of cells. Therefore the use of altering DNA methylation can have
enduring effects on the epigenome. There are periods of development when an
organism is extremely sensitive to changing of DNA methylation. These periods
are called sensitive periods. They include two periods: 1) period of early
development (from fertilization to blastocyst) and 2) period of primordial germ
cells development. Disturbing the normal process of epigenetic reprogramming of
cells leads to epigenetic abnormalities and aberrant imprinting.</span></p>
