    <div class="field-value">With the term CpG islands we mean sequences found within the promoters of genes and consist of many repeated C and G nucleotides. This sequences play rucial roles in the regulation of gene expression. That is to say, if this sequences are methylated, the gene tend to be silenced (not expressed). By contrast, if the CpG islands are umethylated, the expression of the gene is usually induced. In cancer, we have activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes (genetically or epigenetically). It was shown that as the cancer is initiated and progressed, the CpG islands methylation is increased. This is due to the fact that tumor-suppressor genes and other important genes (e.g. pro-apoptotic molecules, mutator genes etc) are methylated and thus are silenced, contributing in the progression of the disease. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements within a gene tentd to be methylated in normal (non-cancerous) cells, contributing to genomic stability (inhibition of illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes). In cancer cells, these regiongs tend to be unmethylated, resulting in genomic instability, which is one of the hallmarks of cancer.   </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Alterations in DNA methylation at ICRs (hypo or hypermethylation), can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes and overexpression of growth promoting genes. This consists an early event in tumorigenesis, often seen in pre-neoplastic tissues. A good example is the Igf2 gene. In the paternal allele, the H19 gene is methylated (and thus not expressed), allowing the gene expression of Igf2 gene. In contrast, in th maternal allele, the H19 gene is unmethylated, so the H19 is expressed, leading to suppression of  Igf2 gene expression. However, in Wilm's tumors, the maternal H19 is methylated (not expressed anymore), leading to Igf2 expression from both paternal and maternal alleles, and thus results in tumorigenesis (Igf2 is a growth factor).  </div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to DNA-demethylating agents, due to the fact that it inhibits DNA methylation (like azacitidine does) and it is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.  It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransefare. <span>It functions in a similar manner to AZT</span><span>, although decitabine can only be incorporated into DNA strands while azacitidine can be incorporated into both DNA and RNA chains. DNA methylation is increased as the cancer is initiated and increased. So, the reversion of DNA methylation back to normal levels, using DNA methylation inhibitors like decitabine, is able to treat cancer. </span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation patters can be retained through DNA replication. When DNA is replicated, the maternal strand has the methylation pattern, whereas the daughter strands in unmethylated. However, methyltransferases of the cell mythylate the daughter strand according the methylation pattern of th maternal strand DNA. So, altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome. Sensitive period is the period when you establish DNA methylation imprinting in your germ cells. This happens in young ages. So, treating young patients with epigenetic Drugs is inadvisable, deo to the fact that the treatment may affect the DNA methylation patterns in their germ cells, resulting in serious problems to ther children. </div>
