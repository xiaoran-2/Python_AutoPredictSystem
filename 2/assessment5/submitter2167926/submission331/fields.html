    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells typically CPG islands are not
methylated.  A hallmark of cancer is that
CpG islands become methylated, and their amount of methylation increases as the
cancer progresses.  CPG islands are found
in about 60% of promoters.  Methylation
of promoters usually suppresses expression of the genes under their
control.   CPG islands are often
promoters for tumor suppressor genes, and methylation of these  CpG istlands (and the shores of CpG islands)
turn off these tumor suppressor genes, thereby contributing to cancer.</p>

<p>Normal cells usually have repetitive elements and intergenic
regions methylated.  It is important to
have repetitive elements methylated because this suppresses their
expression.   When allowed to be
expressed, a repetitive element (and two associated genes) often cause a copy
of this section to be inserted at another random location in the genome.  This can be expected not only to interfere
with the genes and other genetic machinery in the vicinity of the insertion
location, but also to provide a perhaps detrimental extra copy of the
repetitive element.  Such an insertion is
very mutagenic, inducing such genetic copy events as deletions, reciprocal
translocations, and insertions.</p>

<p>Methylation of CpG sections in intergenic regions is also
useful in the normal genome to maintain genomic integrity.   Methylation at intergenic regions may
suppress cryptic transcription start sites or splice sites, thereby preventing
disruption of the faithful translation of a gene.</p>

<p>In cancer, both repetitive elements and intergenic regions
tend to lose their methylation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting is a mechanism whereby each of  two homologous allele clusters passed to an
offspring is ensured its own functional identity.  Disruption of imprinting often causes both
allele clusters to assume the same functional identity, thus over-expressing or
under-expressing important genes in the cluster.  A good example is the H19/Igf2 cluster.</p>

<p>In normal development the H19/Igf2 cluster on chromosome 11 of
humans is paternally imprinted.  That is,
its imprint control region (ICR) is hypermethylated on paternal chromosome 11.  This leads to the activation of the growth
promoter gene IGF2 on the paternal chromosome and the inactivation of H19.  On the maternal side of the cluster in normal
development, the ICR is hypomethylated, which allows the molecule CTCF to bind
to the ICR and block enhancer access to the IGF2 gene, thus preventing its
expression.  In the maternal cluster,
though, there is no methylation to inhibit H19 expression, so this gene is
expressed.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>If the ICR of the maternal H19/Igf2 cluster later becomes
hypermethylated, this causes the maternal cluster to act just like the paternal
one, yielding a double dose of the growth promoter generated by the IGF2
gene.  This results in a tumor of the
kidney, known as Wilm’s tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to a class of DNA methyltransferase
inhibitors.  It inhibits DNA
methyltransferases, thus inhibiting their adding methyl groups to DNA.  Decitabine is used to treat myelodisplastic
syndromes, the precursors of acute myeloid leukemia.  Presumably decitabine works by reducing the
methylation of CpG islands, thereby keeping  tumor suppressive genes expressed, thus allowing
them to maintain their tumor suppressive activity.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A lasting influence of a drug beyond the period of drug
treatment strongly suggests that the effects of the drug are mitotically
heritable.  Methylation
of CpG sequences are known to be mitotically heritable due to the action of DNA
methyl transferase DNMT1, which uses a methylated CpG strand of DNA as a
template to copy methyl marks to the corresponding GpC group on the newly
generated strand.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>There are certain times when the methylation of the genome
are erased and then reset, known as sensitive periods.  The two periods having the most
extensive erasure and resetting of methyl marks occur during early embryonic
development and during the formation of the germ cells.   A drug that was administered after the
erasure but prior to the reestablishment of methyl marks of a sensitive period could
be dangerous in that it could affect the whole genome and have many effects.  Also, it would be difficult to time the
administration of such a drug accurately. 
Given too early its effects would be nullified by the programmed erasure
of epigenetic marks; given later in the sensitive period, there could be an
unpredictable interaction with the programmed resetting of epigenetic marks.</p></div>
