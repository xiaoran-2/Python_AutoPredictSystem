    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In
a normal cell, CpG islands tend to be unmethylated. In cancer cells, CpG
islands are more likely to be methylated. These methylated CpG islands may be
found in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes. Methylations at promoters
cause gene silencing. As a result, tumor suppressor genes get
silenced. This may allow cells to divide more rapidly. </p><p>DNA methylation is
mitotically heritable. Cancer cells divide more rapidly than normal cells.
Therefore gene silencing via methylation is a very effective mechanism for
silencing tumor suppressor genes. Finally this contributes for the tumour
genesis.</p>

<p>Repetitive elements and intergenic regions are methylated in a
normal cell. Methylations at intergenic regions are important to </p><p></p><ul><li>maintain
genomic stability </li><li>silence cryptic transcription start sites. </li></ul>Methylations
at repetitive elements are important for <p></p><ul><li>silencing of repeats to prevent
transposition, </li><li>silencing of repeats to avoid transcriptional interference from
strong promoters and </li><li>maintain genomic integrity. </li></ul>Additionally it prevents
illegitimate recombinations between chromosomes. In order to recombination to
occur chromatin must be in euchromatin form. Hypermethylation condense chromatin into heterochromatin form. Therefore recombinations are less
likely to occur. In cancer cells repetitive elements and intergenic regions
tend to become hypomethylated. So chromatin is in a more open euchromatin form.
Illegitimate recombinations can occur as they are not densely packaged into
heterochromatin.  Repeats can be activated because of the hypomethylation.
Therefore transposition can occur. Additionally cryptic promoters can get activated. This can lead to transcriptional aberration in the
neighboring genes. As DNA get decondense due to hypomethylation, oncogenes can get
activated causing cells to divide rapidly. <p>Therefore hypomethylation and
hypermathylation of DNA has different outcomes based on region of the gene.
Additionally methylations of different genes cause different kinds of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Imprint control
region of H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated on the paternal allele and
unmethylated on the maternal allele. Therefore, it is paternally imprinted. On
the maternal allele when this imprint control region is not methylated it is bound
by a protein called CTCF. CTCF is an insulator protein. Enhancers cannot act on
Igf2 due to binding of this insulator protein. Now enhancers act on H19 and
enhance the expression of H19. Therefore Igf2 is not expressed from the maternal
allele. On the paternal allele when this imprint control region is methylated
CTCF cannot bind to this region. Therefore enhancers can act on Igf2 and Igf2
is expressed from the paternal allele. Hypermethylation of the imprint control
region on the maternal allele can be observed in Wilm’s tumor. That means Imprint
control region of H19/Igf2 cluster is unmethylated on the maternal allele.
Therefore expression of Igf2 can be found on the maternal allele too. Compared
to a normal cell, both alleles express Igf2 in a cancer cell. Therefore Igf2 is
over expressed. Igf2 is growth promoting and also associated with Wilm's tumour.
Therefore disrupting imprinting at H19/Igf2 is contributed to cancer.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Substrate for DNA methyltransferase(DNMT) is hemi methylated DNA. When there
are Decitabine incorporated into the DNA strand, DNMT is bound irreversibly to
the DNA. As a result DNMT can be no longer released and action of DNMT is
inhibited. Cancer cells divide more rapidly than normal cells. Decitabine is a
nucleoside analog. So it can be incorporated into DNA during replication and action
of DNMT can be inhibited.  Therefore cancer
cells get more affected by Decitabine than normal cells. Hypermethylation of
promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes have observed in cancer cells. Methylations
at promoter regions are leading to gene silencing. But DNA hypermethylation is
reversible. Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor and it can be used
prevent transferring methyl groups to promoter regions. So epigenetically
silenced tumor suppressor genes get activated and Decitabine can have an
anti-tumour effect. Decitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs can be used to alter DNA
methylation. Once the pattern of methylation is established, it is
mitotically heritable to daughter cells. DNA methyltransferase enzymes are responsible for maintaining methylation
patterns. Therefore these methyl marks can last for a long period
of time. A sensitive period is a time in which extensive epigenetic
reprogramming occurs. There are two sensitive periods. Those are during primordial
germ cell development and early embryonic development. Treating patients during
sensitive periods can have aberrant effect on normal tissues. Because epigenetic drugs can alter tumour cells as well as normal cells. Effect may be rigorous as "an extensive reprogramming" occurs during sensitive periods. Therefore it is
inadvisable to treat patients who are in early pregnancy and before
conceptions.</p></div>
