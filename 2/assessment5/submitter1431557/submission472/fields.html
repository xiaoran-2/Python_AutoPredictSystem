    <h1>Submission 472 from Anon (session_user_id: 13bfd5ba72ade961087b06efb95032812af104ce)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine (Dacogen), which is a cytidine analog,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_%28chemistry%29"></a> disrupts the
synthesis of DNA through the major class of epigenetic markers constituted by DNA hypomethylation, i.e. it inhibits the
process which adds a methyl group to the adenien DNA nucleotides and
acts as a regulator of gene transcription. In this way, Decitabine
contributes to kill rapidly dividing cells. The exact way Decitabine
exerts its effect is not known, but it probably acts through a
process called phosphorylation, which consist in adding a phosphate
group to a protein. It is incorporated into DNA and, although it
reduces DNA methylation (DNA hypomethylation), does not fully inhibit
DNA synthesis (indeed, DNA hypomethylation as well as DNA
hypermethylation are known to be epigenetic abnormalities linked to
human tumors). It is therefore fair to say that it helps restoring
the right level of DNA methylation and thus the right
level of cell differentiation/proliferation by the
genes.

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The
methylation of CpG sites in the promoter of a gene may turn the gene
off. Overall, the genomic landscape is methylated. This is also true
for cytosine-phosphate-guanine sequences - except for CpG islands which, independently of
their state of activity, typically do no feature methylation. At the CpG islands, methylation also leads to silencing of gene expression.<br /></p>

<p>In cancer cells, CpG islands typically
are hypermethylated (locus-specific) and thus the genes of the cell
are silenced. Particularly, "CpG island shores", i.e.
regions nearby the CpG islands can be hypermethylated and contribute
to cancer. 
</p>

<p>The disruption of DNA methylation at
CpG islands contributes to cancer because typically the
hypermethylation silences tumor supressor genes. In this way the
functions of cell cycle control, apoptosis and DNA repair are not
caried out as usual. Also, there is a loss of imprinting.</p>

<p>The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions is genomic integrity and stability (silencing and mutation of repeats to prevent transposition, transcriptional inference and illegitimate recombination) and for
repetitive elements it is genomic defense (protect genome form transposable elements).</p>
<p>In cancer, the disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions
and repetitive elements ocurs through genome-wide hypomethylation of CpG sites (active - TET proteins are main players - and passive demethylation), which is seen as
being associated with the over-expression of genes within cancer
cells. Also, there is a loss
of imprinting. 
</p>
<p>This disruption comes about because DNA methylation is diminished,
which leads to genomic instability (illegitimate recombination
between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation
of cryptic promoters and disruption to neigbouring genes). 
</p>
<p>The disruption causes cancer against a background of genome-wide
hypomethylation as tumor cells are not eliminated, and cell growth is
not stopped when needed.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The ICR at IGF2 and H19 is normally methylated on the paternal allele. Methylation is excluded from the maternal allele by CTCF binding. The DNA methylation at ICR blocks the binding
of CTCF bindings. Without the CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to the H19
promoter to silence and enhancers can access the Igf2 to activate.</p>

<p>The Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome (imprinted
disorder) features upregulation of Igf2 (oncogene, growth promoting). It is caused by maternal allele behaving like
paternal allele: a) mutation/ deletion causes a loss of
imprinting, b) uniparental disomy, two copies of
one parental chromosome, here paternal UPD. More precisely, the desease is caused by inherited microdeletions in the H19 differentially methylated region 
(DMR) which abolish two CTCF target sites. The loss of the H19/Igf2 imprinting 
control results in hypermethylation of the H19 
DMR, H19 silencing and the Beckwith-Wiedemann 
syndrome.</p><p>In Wilm's tumor the imprinting at the H19/lgf2 cluster is disrupted through increased methylation
                     on the maternal Imprinting Centre 1. This results in silencing of <i>H19</i>. <br /></p>Source used: Sparago &amp; ali: "Mechanisms causing imprinting defects

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">- DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome through miotical inheritance (due to features of DNMT1) - note: without changes in DNA sequence.<br />- Sensitive periods are periods of cell replication and cell division (primordial germ cell development and other specific stages of differentiation).<br />- Examples of sensitive periods are: particularly embryo growth, but also growth periods in general (childhood, adolescence) <br />- Treating patients in a sensitive period is dangerous as their germ cells could be affected and they could get cancer.<br /><br /><br /></div>
