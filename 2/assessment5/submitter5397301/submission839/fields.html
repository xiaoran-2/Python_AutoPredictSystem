    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>CpG islands are often found in the promoter regions of the chromatin. At CpG islands the chromatin is kept free of methylation irrespective of activity. This allows the gene to be expressed.<br /></li><li>In cancer, the promoter CpG islands often become methylated (hypermethylation)</li><li>This in turn causes silencing of the gene and normal expression is not possible. If the driver of the tumour is dependent on the hypermethylation of CpG islands then it can be treated by reducing methylation at these sites.</li><li>At intergenic regions and repetitive elements, DNA methylation silences satellite repeats, LINEs and SINEs. This is thought to provide a regulatory role by reducing transcriptional noise form alternative start sites, preventing antisense transcription, RNA splicing and is also thought to control replication timing. Therefore, a reduction in silencing means the genes can be activated.</li><li>Hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements have been discovered in malignant nerve sheath tumours. The result of activation of these regions can have different dependencies of the genome methylation changes.</li><li>Tumours can change the dependencies throughout their life so there is not one treatment that is suitable for the entire duration.</li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>The ICR for the H19/Igf2 cluster is normally methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele. On the paternal allele the enhancers bind to Igf2 and express it as the imprint control region (ICR) is silenced by methylation. This means there is no expression of H19. On the maternal allele there is no methylation on the ICR so this allows CTCF to bind an insulator element to the ICR meaning the enhancers will activate H19 instead of Igf2.</li><li>In Wilm's tumour there is methylation of the maternal ICR resulting in an over-expression of Igf2, a growth promoter. The over expression of this allele results in a double dose of the growth promoter and this is turn results in childhood kidney tumours. It is often seen in pre-neoplastic tissue which is not yet distinguished as cancerous so is thought to be a precursor event.</li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent</li><li>Decitabine will remove methylation marks on the chromatin particularly at CpG islands where hypermethylation is seen in tumours.</li><li>Myelogenous luekaemia occurs after Myelodysplastic syndromes. If this is discovered it can be treated with Decitabine and the leukaemia can be prevented</li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>DNA methylation marks are maintained by enzymes (DNMT). These marks are inherited by daughter cells in normal cell division.<br /></li><li>A sensitive period is when epigenetic marks are being reset or established after periods of clearing.</li><li>Sensitive periods of development are during primordial germ cell (PGC) development and in the early embryo.</li><li>If epigenetic marking is disrupted then you often get abnormalities and death of the organism (embryo) or cause future abnormalities/issues (PGC)</li></ul></div>
