    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>CpG islands are DNA regions
were Guanine next to Cytosine sequences are frequently observed. CpG islands
are often seen in genes promoters. DNA methylation of CpG islands leads to silencing of underlying gene.</li><li>

In normal cells genes
methylation is observed in intergenic regions, repetitive elements and introns,
but not in promoter region of active genes which contains a lot of CpG sites.
In tumor cells we can see the opposite: CpG islands are highly methylated and intergenic
regions are not.</li><li>Tumor suppressor genes are
genes that in some way protect a cell from cancer (by controlling programmed cell death or DNA repair). Methylation of CpG islands
in tumor suppressor genes is silencing that genes and thus associated with
cancer.</li><li>As was mentioned before, intergenic
regions (and repetitive elements) in normal cells are highly methylated and hence
densely packed in heterochromatin. That helps to maintain genomic stability.</li><li>Hypomethylation of intergenic
regions and repetitive elements results in genomic instability.</li><li>

For example, recombination
between two non-homologous chromosomes may occur because of similarity of repetitive
elements in those two chromosomes. Recombination requires open chromatin, so normal
cells with densely packed repetitive elements are protected from this kind of
thing.</li></ul><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Imprinted control region is methylated on the <b>paternal allele</b> and unmethylated on the <b>maternal allele</b>. And unmethylated region is bound by protein called CTCF. And CTCF insulates lgf2 gene from enhancers. Because of that, enhancers act on another gene (H19). And lgf2 is not expressed on the <b>maternal allele</b>. CTCF can’t bind to methylated imprinted control region. Thus enhancers acts on lgf2 gene and activate it on the <b>paternal allele</b>.</li><li>

Hypermethylation of imprinted
control region on maternal allele leads to expression of lgf2 on that allele.
Thus cell gets a double dose of lgf2.</li><li>

And lgf2 is growth promoting, so
double dose of it leads to cell overgrowth and cancer.</li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Decitabine is a
hypomethylating agent.<span> This
means that it reduces methylation.</span></li><li>

It demethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA
methyltransferase [Wikipedia].</li><li>

Decitabine demethylates SpG
islands of tumor suppressor genes which makes them active.</li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>DNA methylation is mitotically
heritable, so altering DNA methylation will have stable effect.</li><li>

Sensitive period are periods
when epigenetic marks can be easily influenced by environment.</li><li>

Pre-implantation and early
post-implantation period, period of gametogenesis and period of cells differentiation
are sensitive. Probably those periods (during pregnancy or stem cell therapy)
are not the best for treating
patients with this drugs.</li><li>

Drugs can influence
establishment of epigenetics marks of next generations (pregnancy) or damage stem
cell therapy.</li></ul></div>
