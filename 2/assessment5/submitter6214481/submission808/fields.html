    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell CpG islands are regions of the genome where
cytosines followed by guanines are common. 
These CpG islands are often located at a gene promoter and when they are
methylated they silence expression of the gene associated with that promoter.  Although most CpG islands are unmethylated
certain islands are methylated by the DNMT3a and DNMT3b
methyltransferases.  Cancerous cells
often exhibit hypermethylation of CpG islands. 
This results in gene silencing and can contribute to tumor growth when
the gene associated with the promoter is a tumor suppressor.  </p>

<p>Unlike CpG islands there are sites in the intergenic regions
and repetitive regions of the genomic that are typically methylated in healthy
cells.  Methylation of the intergenic
regions in believed to stabilize the genome by silencing cryptic transcription
start sites and cryptic splice sites.  In
repetitive elements methylation helps to prevent transposable elements from
moving inside the genome and to prevent recombination within the genome.  Methylation can also serve to silence the
effects of strong promoters thereby minimizing transcriptional interference.</p>

<p>In cancerous cells the opposite methylation pattern is
observed – these regions are typically methylated.  Since methylation at these points helps to
stabilize the genome abnormal methylation can stimulate cancer.  For instance, if a intergenic region, which
happens to be a transposable element, 
lacks methylation it could jump into a different point in the genome and
disrupt a tumor suppressor gene.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Decitabine </strong>is a drug manufactured by the Japanese pharmaceutical
company Eisai under the trade name <em>Dacogen</em>. 
As a DNA-demethylating agent is inhibits the function of DNA
methyltransferase.  This means that
during cell division replicated DNA strands are not able to replicate the
methylation pattern found on the original DNA strand.  The end result is that the methylation
pattern is effectively diluted over time.</p>

<p>A characteristic of some cancers is the hypermethylation of
CpG islands.  CpG islands are typically associated
with promotors that can regulate tumor suppressor genes.  In cancer the methylate CpG islands can
downregulate the expression of these genes allowing the cancer to spread.  Decitabine can act to remove the CpG island methylation
and restore tumor suppression function to the cell.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter the methylation of DNA are affecting the
cell’s epigenetic state.  Since
epigenetic characteristics are defined as being mitotically heritable the
characteristic of one cell are passed on down to its daughter cells.  This mean that an epigenetic drug can have
effects that remain long after the drug treatment is stopped.</p>

<p>Such drugs should not be used during an epigenetically
sensitive period.  These are periods when
cells are undergoing substantial reshaping of the epigenetic landscape and
environmental factors (such as epigenetic drugs) can have a large effect.  In particular these periods are during early
embryo development and during primordial germ cell development.  Drug with epigenetically effects can leave a
person with lifelong epigenetic abnormalities if used during embryo development,
or could even have a negative effect on the future progeny if used during primordial
germ cell development.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal healthy cell the H19/Igf2 cluster is imprinted, meaning
that gene expression occurs only on a parent specific allele.  Normally the Imprint Control Region (ICR) is
methylated on the paternally inherited allele and unmethylated on the
maternally inherited allele.  When unmethylated
the CTCF protein binds to the ICR which allows downstream enhancers to activate
H19 expression leaving the Igf2 unexpressed. 
However, on the methylated paternal allele the methylation prevents CTCF
from binding.  This means that the
enhancers affect Igf2 instead of H19.  </p>

<p>In Wilm’s tumor the maternal allele is hypermethylated
making it epigenetically similar to the paternal allele.  CTCF is unable to bind to the ICR resulting
no expression of H19 but increased expression of Igf2.  Since Igf2 is a growth promotor this
condition causes unregulated growth of the cells.</p></div>
