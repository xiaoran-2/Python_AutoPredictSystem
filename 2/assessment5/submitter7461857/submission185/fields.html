    <div class="field-value">In normal cells CpG islands are found at the promoter of genes, including tumor suppressor genes. In normal cells, the CpG islands are un-methylated, which leads to the expression of tumor suppressor genes which results in normal living of a cell.<br /><br />In Cancer, the CpG islands are hyper methylated, which leads to the inactivation or silencing of tumor suppressor genes. Inactivation of tumor suppressor genes leads to loss of apoptosis or other related mechanisms and hence leads to cancer.<br /><br />In normal cells, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are highly methylated which leads to the silencing of the repeats and hence prevents genomic instability. The repeats when silenced prevent transposition, avoids transcriptional interference from the strong promoters of these regions, avoids illegitimate DNA recombination between repeats. Hence in normal cells silencing of the intergenic regions and repeats avoids genomic instability and normal living of a cell .<br /><br />In the case of cancer, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypo-methylated and which leads to the expression of these repeats. Thus leading to several consequences including the jumping around of repeats along the genome, transcriptional interference from the intergenic regions to the neighboring regions, illegitimate DNA recombinations between the repeats, illegitimate deletion or insertions or duplication or reciprocal tranlocations, all of these leading to genomic instability and in turn contributing to cancer. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The HI9/Igf2 cluster shows imprinted nature by "Enhancer blocking" mechanism.<br /><br />In the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated and the CTCF (insulator protein) doesn't bind to the ICR, in addition to that the methylation spreads to H19 promoter, and hence H19 RNA is not expressed. Since CTCF doesn't bind in the paternal allele, the enhancers have access to Igf2 and activates the expression of Igf2.<br /><br />Now, on the maternal allele, the ICR is not methylated and the CTCF binds to the unmethylated ICR. In the maternal allele, the H19 RNA is expressed. Since the CTCF binds to the ICR, the enhnacers don't have access to the Igf2 gene and hence on the maternal allele, the Igf2 is not expressed. It is important to note that IGf2 is a oncogene. <br /><br />In Wilm's tumor, there is hyper-methylation of the ICR, that means now the ICR on both the alleles are methylated and the CTCF does not bind to either of the ICR. The enhancers on each allele have access to the Igf2 gene and there is expression of Igf2 on both the alleles. Hence there is double dosage of Igf2 protein which is a oncogene which leads to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the DNA methyltranferase inhibitor class of epigenetic inhibitors.<br /><br />Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue drug and it irreversibly binds to DNA methyl transferase 1 after the drug gets incorporated into DNA, thereby Decitabine reduces the level of DNA methylation and can be regarded as "hypo-methylating agent". <br /><br />We know that in cancer there is locus specific hyper-methylation at CpG islands and at some ICR, because of this hyper-methylation there is low expression of tumor suppressors and large expression of oncogenes in some cancers. When Decitabine is given to the patient, the level of hyper-methylation is decreased as the cancer cells divide, because there is a dilution of DNA methylation due to inhibition of DNA methyl trasferase and thereby there is less methylation at CpG islands and at some ICR which leads to the reduction of tumor cells and hence Decitabine has an anti-tumour effect.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation has a long lasting (enduring) effect on the epigenome because it is mitotically heritable to daughter cells. Either reduction of overall DNA methylation or increase in the level of DNA methylation can be maintained and mitotically heritable. And since the DNA methylation profile is maintained in the subsequent daughter cells, drugs that alter DNA methylation have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment.<br /><br />Sensitive periods are the time periods during the development of an organism, in which there are lots of epigenetic reprogramming taking place, that is either addition of epigenetic marks or removal of epigenetic marks on a large scale. In simple words there is active remodelling of the epigenome.<br /><br />The sensitive periods of development are 1. During the primordial germ cell development and 2. Pre-implantation period and early post implantation period.<br /><br />It is inadvisable to treat patients with drugs during these sensitive periods because the drugs would interfere with the regular (normal) DNA methylation pattern and reprogramming of the Imprinted genes, Repeats and other parts of the genome during this reprogramming period, which would have several consequences on the patient and it could have trans-generational effects on the offspring's through the gametes.  </div>
