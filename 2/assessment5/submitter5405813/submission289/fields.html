    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is the basis for epigenetic changes such as imprinting, X chromosome inactivation or the formation of heterochromatin. DNA methylation of promoter regions of many genes inversely correlates with gene expression<span>. Exceptions are CpG islands, which are found in about 60% of promoters. </span>In normal cells CpG islands are hipomethylated
causing hipermethylation of repetitive elements, intergenic regions and introns
and normal function of the gene, while in cancer cells opposite event is taking
place were CpG region of a gene is hypermethylated causing hipomethylation of
repetitive elements, intergenic region and even introns altering the function
of the gene and therefore causing tumor occurrence. Hypomethylation of repeats
and intergenic regions causes increased genetic instability enabling illegitimate
recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and their transposition that
can lead to additional deletions and reciprocal translocations and insertions. All these epigenetic changes can lead to genetic changes and cause alteration in cell genome.</p>

<p>CGI (CpG islands) are found in promoter regions
of tumor suppressor genes (that are regulators of cell growth and division and
are altered in cancer). Hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes occurs very
often in tumors due to mitotical heritability of DNA methylation and rapid
selection of epimutation contributing to the development of cancer.</p>

<p>Hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters can
result in activation of some genes (like Ras in gastric cancer) and lead to
cancer development.</p><p>As we can see epigenetic changes (as well as genetic changes) can occur on many different levels in cellular genetic regulation and this alterations can lead to cancer development.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In human cells imprinted alleles are silenced such that the genes are either expressed only from the non-imprinted allele inherited from the mother (e.g. <i>H19)</i>, or from the non-imprinted allele inherited from the father (e.g. <i>IGF-2</i>).<br /></p><p>Alterations
in DNA methylation in imprinting control regions (ICRs) (hypo- or hyper-methylation) can result in loss of
expression of growth restrictive genes and overexpression of growth promoting
genes (like IGF2). Insuline-like Grow Factor-2 / H19 cluster is methylated on paternal allele and un-methylated
on maternal allele. On maternal allele unmethylated CTCF will bind to its insulator element and enable enhancers to act on H19, therefore leaving IGF2 silenced.  On
the paternal allele, on the other hand, because this area is methylated the
enhancers acts on IGF2 and IGF2 will be expressed from the pattern allele.</p>

<p>However,
with loss of imprinting there is a hyper-methylation of the imprint control region
on the maternal allele occurring, with doubled expression of IGF2, in comparison with
the normal cell. Because IGF-2 is growth promoting factor its overexpression can lead
to development of kidney cancer known as Wilm's tumor that typically occur in children due to its early development. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that are targeting enzymatic epigenetic regulators
(enzymes are most readily targeted with small molecule inhibitors) usually bind
and use ATP to move molecules around, and can find and act on the active site
of the enzyme.</p>

Decitabine belongs to the group of epigenetic drugs
that are targeting DNA methyl-transferase (DNMT) and are called DNMT
inhibitors (DNMTi). DNMT inhibitors are nucleoside analogues and are
irreversibly binding to DNA during DNA replication. They are replication dependent (good for treatment of rapidly
dividing cancer cells). Drugs like Decitabine get incorporated into DNA during its replication and the binding is irreversible. Therefore drug can not be released from DNA enabling treatment of epigenetic
changes on DNA molecule. In the past big doses of the drug were given to the patients in order to treat cancer. It has recently been found that using DNMTi at lower
doses causes DNA methylation and have anti-neoplastic effect.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effect on the
epigenome by altering the loss or gain of gene function that can lead to
disorder. On the epigenetic level we see different alterations in the genome:
CGI hypermethylation, genome-wide hypomethylation, altered histone marks,
altered IncRNAs, altered nuclear structure; while at genetic level we see point
mutations, translocations, amplifications, deletions and copy number variation.
Altering the epigenome can lead to genome alterations and therefore appearance
of disease (like cancer).</p>

<p>Early life
constitutes a period during which there is increased sensitivity to the
regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms. There are two major periods
sensitive to epigenetic control known as sensitive periods of development: 1)
period from primordial germ cell development to production of mature egg and
sperm, and 2) early implantation and post implantation period. In those two
periods there are active remodeling of epigenetic marks present and these
periods are considered very sensitive to environment. Therefore, treatment in
the early stages of development, that can alter epigenetic changes and can also
alter genetic changes in the cells leading to undesired and un-reversible mutations of the
genome with irreparable consequences.</p></div>
