    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is one important epigenetic hallmark,
which is involved in gene imprinting, X chromosome inactivation and the
formation of heterochromatin. And methylation in the promoter region is usually
associated with gene suppression. Normally, promoter CpG islands are kept free
of methylation. In cancer cells, however, CpG islands are tend to be
methylated, leading to the silence of the underlying gene, which could probably
be a tumor suppressor gene.</p>

<p><span>Normal DNA methylation is also essential for the correct
replication timing and genome stability. Intergenic regions, which might
contain alternative replication start sites, could bring in transcriptional noise
by antisense transcription. Suppressing transcription from these sites by DNA
methylation could reduce those noises. Hypermethylation is also found in the
repetitive elements. Keeping the repetitive elements in heterochromatin state
could prevent illegal homologous recombination happening in these sites. In cancer,
intergenic regions and repetitive elements become hypomethylated, which
contributes to abnormal gene suppression (by antisense transcription) and
instable genome.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Igf2 is an imprinted gene. In the downstream of
Igf2, there locate a binding site for CTCF, gene H19 and an enhancer. In the
paternal allele, CTCF binding site and the promoter of H19 are methylated,
which blocks the binding of CTCF and silences gene H19. Without the insulator
effect of CTCF, transcription of Igf2 is unregulated by the downstream
enhancer. In the maternal allele, both CTCF binding site and H19 promoter are
not methylated. This allows the binding of insulator protein CTCF. Igf2 in this
allele will not be activated by the downstream enhancer thus becomes silenced
and gene H19 will be activated instead.</p>

<p><span>When the imprinting of Igf2 is lost, Igf2 will be
activated in both alleles, bringing too much Igf2 in the cell. Gene Igf2 is a
growth factor. It could promote expression level of genes associated with
growth. Most of these genes are also associated with cancer when they are out
of control.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a kind of DNA-demethylating agents. It
acts as a cytidine analog and is incorporated into the DNA. When DNA
methyltransferase comes nearby to methylate the cytidine, the incorporated Decitabine
will covalently bind to the DNA methyltransferase and inhibit its function,
leading to DNA hypomethylation. This might result in activation of some tumor
suppressor genes, bring about an anti-tumor effect. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotic heritable. So altering
DNA methylation will have a lasting effect.</p>

<p><span>DNA methylation marks are generally removed actively
or inactively in two periods in development. One is during the formation of the
blastocyst; the other is during the formation of the primordial germ cells. These
two periods are defined as sensitive period. We should be cautious in treating
patients with these drugs when they are in the sensitive periods. Because these
drugs will disrupt the establishment of correct DNA methylations marks. If DNA
methylation marks could not be established after clearing in the sensitive
period, the consequence could be disastrous.</span></p></div>
