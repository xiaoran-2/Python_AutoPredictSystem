    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation, is a biochemical process where a methyl group is added to a cytosine, and, generally takes place at CpG islands of gene promoters. This is an essencial process for normal development and associated with key processes including genomic imprinting or carcinogenesis. Predominantly, CpG island methylation is important in regulation of gene expression, since is associated with gene silencing. <br /><br />Alterations of DNA methylation are important component of cancer development. Hypomethylation is associated with chromosomal instability, loss of imprinting and ocongene activation, whereas hypermethylation typically occurs at CpG islands in the promoter region and is linked to tumour supressor inactivation. In cancer, gene promoter CpG islands, acquire abnormal hypermethylation, which results in transcriptional silencing that can be inherited by daughter cells destabilizing genetic mutations and can lead to a precancerous cellular state. When a mutation results in LOH <span>at tumor suppressor gene sites, these genes may become inactive by CpG methylation. <br /></span><br />Intergenic regions (IR) are sequences of noncoding DNA that contain functionally important elements such as promoters and enhancers. Repeated sequences (RE) are patterns of DNA that occur in high number of copies throughout the genome, and originate by transposition.<span> Occasional insertion of RE into genes can disrupt the gene function and cause a disease. </span><br /> It has been described that DNA methylation of RE and IR are frequently disrupted in cancer causing genomic instability, activation of oncogenes and  and maintaince of a closed chromatin structure. Generally, REs are highly methylated and this status is associated with maintenance of chromosome structure and genome integrity. In mammals, tissue- and cell type-specific methylation is present in a small percentage of CpG island promoters, while a far greater proportion occurs across gene bodies, coinciding with highly conserved IR. Tissue-specific intragenic methylation might reduce, or, paradoxically, enhance transcription elongation efficiency. <br /> </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) encodes a fetal growth-factor and H19 is a noncodingRNA that encodes a transcript that can suppress cellular proliferation. These two genes are are both imprinted in a reciprocal matter, where the paternal chromosome express IGF2 but not H19, and the maternal transcribe H19 but not IGF2. Several sites upstream of H19 are methylated on the patternal allele and unmethylated on maternal allele. <br />The ICR-sequence contains transcriptional repressors (CTCFs) binding sites. CTCFs binding on the maternal ICR works as an insulator blocking the enhancer and thereby silences the maternal Igf2, and paternal-specific methylation prevents CTCF-binding allowing the expression of paternal igf2. <br /><div>Loss of imprinting can result in cancer when an imprinted, normally silent allele that provides cells with a growth advantage is activated, resulting in uncontrolled cell growth and division. For example Wilm's tumour cells shown loss of imprinting of the maternal chromosome and a switch to the paternal pattern of methylation. As the function of H19 is to turn off IGF2 expression and slow cell growth, then the loss of imprinting at the H19/IGF2 locus results in IGF2 overexpression  and uncontrolled cell growth that can lead to tumor formation.<br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is an analogue of cytidine, a nucleoside present in DNA and RNA. This chemical is a  thought to induce antineoplastic activity via inhibition of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), ca<span>using hypomethylation of DNA, by </span><span>trapping DNTMs in a covalent complex on DNA resulting in the enzymes' degradation. Decitabine, to be active, must be incorporated into the</span> genome during de S phase of the cell cycle. So a mantained treatment with decitabine, induces a progressive loss of methylation in the genome. <br /><br />Treatment of cancer patients with decitabine, induces a loss of methylation of hypemethylated CpG islands of tumor supressor genes, leading to its reexpression and improving their survival and prognosis. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Alter patterns of DNA methylation can reactivate tumor supressor genes or restore suitable chromatin structure allowing better access of chemotherapeutic classic drugs and making the cells more susceptible to die due to reactivation of cell death pathways. <br /><br />A sensitive period is one in which the use of epigenetic drugs can affect the establishment of the correct imprinting patterns required for proper functioning of the human body during development. Among them is are the pre-implantational reprogramming and the formation of primordial germ cells. In turn, each tissue has its sensitive periods, such as the developing brain that is very suscpetible acquiring epigenetic changes that can lead to mental illness in adults.For all these reasons, you should not treat patients during this periods. <br /><br /></div>
