    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are usually not
methylated in normal cells. The methylation of particular subgroups of promoter
CpG islands can, however, be detected in normal tissues. The
low level of DNA methylation in tumors as compared with the level of DNA
methylation in their normal tissue counterparts was one of the first epigenetic
alterations to be found in human cancer. Also, we can find profiles of
hypermethylation of the CpG islands in tumor suppressor genes which are
specific to the cancer type. Recently devised epigenomic techniques have
revealed maps of hypermethylation of the CpG islands that suggest the occurrence
of 100 to 400 hypermethylated CpG islands in the promoter regions of a given
tumor.</p>

<p>But authors still don’t understand
how CpG islands become hypermethylated in some types of cancer but not in
others. Inactivation of a particular gene by methylation could give certain
tumor types a growth advantage. CpG islands can have a location within a
particular nucleotide sequence that allows them to become hypermethylated, or
they can be located in a chromosomal region that is subject to large-scale
epigenetic dysregulation. </p>

<p>The hypermethylation of
repetitive sequences probably prevents chromosomal instability, translocations,
and gene disruption caused by the reactivation of transposable DNA sequences. Hypomethylation of DNA
repetitive elements is a common ﬁnding in cancer, In
contrast to CpG islands (in the previous section), DNA repetitive elements are
normally heavily methylated in somatic tissues and account for more than
one-third of the total DNA methylation in the human genome. However,
during tumorigenesis global DNA hypomethylation is attributable to a decrease
of DNA methylation in DNA repetitive elements, as there is an association of
DNA repetitive element methylation and total genomic 5-methylcytosine. The
etiologies of this global decrease in DNA methylation is not known but may be
induced by environmental factors and precede cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><i>IGF2</i> transcription is subject to genomic imprinting. We know from some studies that <i>IGF2</i> expression is from the paternal allele, whereas the maternal allele is normally inactive. Moreover, this loss of imprinting occurs when there is abnormal activation of the maternal copy of <i>IGF2</i> and the resultant overexpression contributes to tumor growth. <i>IGF2</i> expression is coordinately regulated with the maternally expressed <i>H19</i> gene that produces a noncoding RNA. Apart from all of that, in Wilms tumour and colorectal cancer, biallelic expression of <i>IGF2</i> has been observed in association with loss of methylation at a DMR (differentially methylated regions (DMRs)) in <i>IGF2. </i>This DMR, known as DMR0, has been shown to be methylated on the silent maternal <i>IGF2</i> allele presumably with a role in repression. <br />Because the ICR1 region controls the genomic imprinting of the H19 and IGF2 genes, this abnormality disrupts the regulation of both genes. Hypermethylation of the ICR1 region leads to a loss of H19 gene activity and increased activity of the IGF2 gene in many tissues. A loss of H19 gene activity, which normally restrains growth, and an increase in IGF2 gene activity, which promotes growth, together lead to overgrowth and an increased risk of tumors.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a drug, sold also as Dacogen by Eisai, that is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia (but for the moment only in animal models). More in detail, decitabine is an specific inhibitor of DNA methylation. It is consist on a drug that requires activation via phosphorylation by deoxcytidine kinase. The nucleotide analog is incorporated into DNA, where it produces an irreversible inactivation of DNA methyltransferase. The demethylation of DNA by this analog in neoplastic cells can lead to the reactivation of silent tumor-suppressor genes, induction of differentiation or senescence, growth inhibition, and loss of clonogenicity (Richard, L, et al., 2005). However, t<span>he major toxicity produced by this analog is granulocytopenia. <br /></span>Moreover, in last years, preliminary clinical trials of this drug using different dose-schedules have shown interesting antineoplastic activity in patients with leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and non-small cell lung cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">An alternative link between genes and disease could be the mechanisms that alter the function of genes without altering the underlying DNA sequence. These include DNA methylation and have enduring effects on epigenome (therefore, a change in phenotype without a change in genotype).<span><br /><br />A sensitive period refers</span> to important periods of childhood development. During a sensitive period it is very easy for children to acquire certain abilities, such as language, discrimination of sensory stimuli, and mental modeling of the environment. Children go through a number of sensitive periods, during which they are particularly receptive to certain types of stimuli. <span>Between birth and the age of 6, children move through 11 sensitive periods.  It is important to note that childhood development does not cease after these early sensitive periods have passed, but these periods are, a crucial foundation for later learning and development. <br /><br />It is also very important to take into account</span> that experiences during sensitive periods of development influence DNA methylation patterns of several genes. These patterns represent stable epigenetic modifications that alter gene transcription and promote specific behavioral outcomes. This is the main reason that explain why treating patients during this periods could be inadvisable.</div>
