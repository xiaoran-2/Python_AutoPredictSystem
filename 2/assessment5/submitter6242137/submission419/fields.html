    <div class="field-value"><b>DNA methylation</b> is one of the basic epigenetic marks. It is a modification (addition of methyl group) of cytosine base and usually occurs in approximately 70 - 80 % of CpG islands. DNA methylation is responsible for important processes in genome such as imprinting, X chromosome inactivation or condensation of chromatin. <br /><br />In general, DNA methylation in <b>CpG islands</b> of promoters functions as a<b> repressive mark</b>. It causes underlying genes to be silenced. However, there are also unmethylated CpG islands, found in about 60% of promoters, that do not influence the activity of genes.<br />In addition to CpG islands methylation, there also occurs methylation at<b> intergenic regions </b>and methylation at<b> repetitive elements</b>. Either of them contributes to overall <b>genomic integrity</b>, though in different manners. Methylated intergenic regions silence cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites, while methylated repetitive elements prevent transposition. <br /><br />For a cell to become <b>cancerous</b>, major changes in its genome must happen. One of these changes is a disruption of methylation pattern. <b>CpG islands</b> in cancer cells use to be<b> hypermethylated</b>, which leads to silencing of tumour supressor genes and eventually results in <b>uncontrolable growth</b> of the cell. Another aberrant methylation occurs at <strong>CpG island shores</strong> (2kbp around CpG islands). This correlates with normal gene expression. Methylation at intergenic regions and repeats is affected as well, although in a reversed way. Meaning that <b>intergenic regions</b> and <b>repeats</b> are <b>hypomethylated</b>. The consequences are therefore exactly opposite -<b> the genomic stability and integrity is decreasing</b> and all the physiological processes in the cell are becoming impaired.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><b>Genomic imprinting</b> is an epigenetic process by which certain genes are expressed in a parent-of-origin manner. Alleles are usually  marked by methylation. One example of imprinted genes is<b> H19/Igf locus</b>, where H19 gene is in physiological cases expressed only from maternal chromosome and Igf2 only from paternal chromosome. The imprinting here is based on the insulator model mechanism:<br />The <b>ICR </b>on the <b>maternal </b>chromosome <b>binds CTCF</b> which prevents Igf2 from being expressed (because enhancers are insulated from Igf2)  but does not silence H19. <br />On the <b>paternal</b> chromosome the <b>ICR is methylated</b>. This methylation stops CTCF from bindig thus allowing enhancers to access Igf2 and activate it. Methylation of ICR also contribute to H19 silencing.<br /><br />In a specific type of tumour - <b>Wilm´s tumour</b> this imprinting mechanism is altered due to hypermethylation. The maternal ICR and H19 are both methylated which results in Igf2 being transcribed. Thus the cell has<b> overexpressed Igf2 gene</b> and <b>no expression of H19 gene</b>. <br />Since the Igf2 is a hormone whose main function is to promote growth, cells with two active copies of this gene exhibit <b>uncontrollable growth</b> and are therefore considered to be cancer cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><strong>Decitabine </strong>(Dacogen) is an epigenetic drug which is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes. Chemically speaking, Decitabine is a cytidine analog and it belongs to class of epigenetic inhibitors called <strong>hypomethylating agents</strong>. The manner in which decitabine functions is following:<br />Firstly it incorporates into DNA. Then, during replication, DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt) binds to this base anolog. The bond which is created between them is, however, irreversible, so the Dnmt can no longer be realeased and copy the methylation to daughter DNA strands. The result is overall <strong>demethylation</strong> of DNA. <br />It is known that in cancer cells, there are usually certain regions (mostly CpG islands of promoters) which are hypermethylated. This hypermethylation causes tumour supressor genes to be repressed and consequently the cell growth becomes promoted. Drugs with character of Decitabine - hypomethylators, are therefore, in low doses effective in an anti - tumour treatment.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic modifications as for instance DNA methylation are <strong>inherited</strong> (copied ) <strong>from a mother cell to a daughter cell</strong> during the process of cell division. This way they remain quite stable throughout the life. If there happen to be any defective methylation marks (as in cancer cells) and they become erased by an appropriate drug, this change should be equally <strong>stable</strong>. Demethylating agents are therefore believed to have enduring effects on the epigenome.<br /><br />In the process of the mammalian development there are two periods during which methylation marks on DNA are removed and new ones are reestablished. <strong>Primordial germ cells development</strong> (PGC) and <strong>early embryonic stage</strong> - these periods are believed to be <strong>sensitive</strong> as some environmental factors can lead to disrupting of the process of  establishing new epigenetics marks.  <br /><em><br /></em>Nowadays, many epigenetic drugs are used to treat cancer and other diseases caused by changes in epigenome. These drugs usually target epigentic machinery and correct aberrant modifications. If, however, they were used in <strong>individuals within sensitive periods </strong>(just before puberty when germ cells are developing), it would result in producing cells with inappropriate epigentic modifications, which can be passed on offspring. In such cases this kind of treatment is <strong>not recommended</strong>.<br /><br /></div>
