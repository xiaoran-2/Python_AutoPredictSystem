    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">The normal function of DNA methylation is adding a methyl group to adenine or cysteine nucleotides. This biological function is responsible for suppressing repetitive elements, X inactivation and genomic imprinting. With cancer cells, the CpG islands are hypermethylated. This results in cancer cells evading growth suppressors and resisting death. These hypermethylated cells are able to induce angiogenesis and avoid immune detection. This leads to inflammation and genome instability.
DNA methylation in non-coding RNA and interons promotes genetic stability by preventing disruptions in the intergenic regions and junk DNA. In these areas, cancer cells have hypomethylation. That is, they have less methyl groups than a normal cell. The repetitive elements can make copies of themselves and jump around the genome leading to copying errors, such as deletions, insertions and translocations.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">CTCF is an insulator protein. It is blocked by DNA methylation. The maternal allele is unmethylated and the paternal allele is methylated. H19 is produced by the maternal allele. Igf2 is expressed only from the paternal allele, not the maternal allele. Igf2 causes the methylation of H19 by heterochromatin spreading and methylation spreading. This silences CTCF. CTCF cannot block the effects of Igf2. Both maternal and paternal alleles are methylated. H19 is affected and is no longer being produced. This is associated with the condition known as Wilm's tumor. 
Wilm's tumor is caused by a deletion on chromosome 11 at the p13 band. The tumor suppression genes are blocked. This causes tumors to usually grow on the kidney but tumors can grow on other organs. This condition manifests itself in newborns and very young children. This condition is also associated with Beckman-Wiedemann syndrome. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a demethylating agent. Methylation regulates gene expression. Hypermethylation blocks the abilities of suppressor genes. These genes control cell division and growth. In time, these cells may become cancerous. 
Decitabine reduces the growth of tumor cells by causing a decline in hypermethylation. This effect has been linked to the reactivation of the suppressor genes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The epigenetic drugs that Dr. Baylin mentioned in his article altered a cancerous cells hypermethylation. The drugs preserved the methyl marks on the DNA. Essentially, the cells were reprogrammed. This preservation remained intact during mitosis. 
Sensitive periods would include the creation of gametes. It would be inadvisable for a pregnant woman to undergo treatment with these drugs since they remove methyl groups from occurring on DNA strands. During early pregnancy, reprogramming during mitosis and meiosis occurs and the effect from these drugs could cause birth defects not only to the fetus, but also to the following generations.</div>
