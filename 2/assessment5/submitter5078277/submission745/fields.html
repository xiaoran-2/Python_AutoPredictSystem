    <div class="field-value">One of the epigenetic aberrations seen in cancer is the alteration of DNA methylation. This can occur in CpG islands, where there are low rates of DNA methylation (hypomethylation) in normal cells. However, in many cancer cells there is an aberrant hypermethylation present in CpG islands of some tumour suppressor genes, which lead to silence these genes and, consequently, to cancer progression. Some examples of genes hypermethylated in CpG islands are: RB in retinoblastoma, MLH1 in colorectal cancer, BRCA1 in breast cancer or MGMT in gliomas and colorectal cancer.<br />On the other hand, methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements can also be altered in some tumours. In normal conditions, these regions are usually methylated. However, in many tumours they are hypomethylated, leading to genomic instability. These instability can represent illegitimate recombinations between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Disruption of imprinting can produce alterations in normal expression of some genes and, as a consequence, contribute to cancer. An example is the imprint control region of H19/Igf2 cluster, which is methylated in the paternal allele, but unmethylated in the maternal allele. The unmethylation of maternal allele lead CTCF to bind to its insulator element, causing that the enhancers promote the expression of H19 and the silencing of Igf2. Conversely, in paternal allele the enhancers promote Igf2 expression and H19 silencing, due to methylation.<br />However, in Wilm's tumour there is methylation of imprint control region in both paternal and maternal allele. This methylation of maternal allele leads to expression of Igf2 in both alleles and, consequently, a double dose of this gene, which is a growth promoting gene.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine, called Dacogen, is a DNA-demethylating agent, meaning that it is an epigenetic drug that promotes demethylation. This allows the reduction of hypermethylation in some tumours, slowing its growth. The use of decitabine and other epigenetic drugs could be very interesting because they can help to stop cancer growth without having to kill all its cells.<br />Moreover, studies with decitabine and other epigenetic drugs showed that its administration lead to an improved reaction to routine chemotherapeutic drugs.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation has enduring effects on the epigenome because they are mitotically heritable marks. These marks are replaced during early development and during germ cell development, which are called sensitive periods, and they are the periods of epigenetic reprogramming. Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because the marks are reprogrammed.<br /><br /><br /></div>
