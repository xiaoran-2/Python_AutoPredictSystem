    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are normally not methylated. In cancer cells, the CpG islands become hypermethylated, meaning that an abnormal number of methyl groups are added. Hypermethylation at CpG islands can silence tumor-suppressing genes, and subsequently lead to cancer.  

DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements permits genomic stability. When cancer occurs, these regions become hypomethylated, meaning that they have fewer methyl groups than normal.The genomic instability caused by hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements causes cancer via several potential mechanisms. Illegitimate recombination between repeats can occur, and there may be transposition or activation of repeats. Cryptic promoters may be activated, and neighboring genes may be disrupted.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the typical paternal allele, the imprint control region (ICR) is methylated, and the binding of CTCF (an insulator protein that insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers) is blocked. In the absence of CTCF, methylation spreads silences the H19 promoter, and also, enhancers can access and activate Igf2. CTCF is present on the maternal allele; it insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. Typically, the maternal allele is hypomethylated or unmethylated; this results in the expression of H19, and silences Igf2. 

In healthy/non-Wilm's tumor cells, the maternal H19 gene and paternal Igf2 gene are expressed. Sites in the ICR that are upstream of H19 are unmethylated or hypomethylated on the maternal allele and methylated on the paternal allele. When loss of imprinting occurs, as in Wilm's tumor, the maternal chromosome experiences a paternal methylation pattern on the H19 promoter, so that Igf2 is activated and H19 is silenced; this combination of events produces increased cell growth, which results in the tumor. 

H19 expression is strongly associated with cell ploidy, and in general the H19/Igf2 cluster can significantly contribute to DNA integrity or genomic instability. Such instability might involve ploidy changes, translocations, inversions, or deletions of chromosomes, breaks in DNA, or misexpression of genes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The JQ1 molecule inhibits the epigenetic regulator BRD4; this blocks the activity of the Myc gene, which gene encodes a transcription factor that is involved in human gene expression (approximately 15% of all human genes) and which, when it is improperly regulated, becomes a common cause of cancer. Decitabine belongs to the class of epigenetic inhibitors that block BRD4, with the ultimate aim of blocking the Myc gene. Decitabine reduces the methylation of DNA (i.e. hypomethylates DNA) via the mechanism of inhibition of DNA methyltransferase. 

Decitabine can act as an anti-tumor agent via two different mechanisms: a) it inhibits DNA methyltransferase, which causes hypomethylation of DNA, which can reduce the incidence of tumors; and b) its incorporation into DNA strands when given at high doses can cause cytotoxicity to abnormal hematopoietic cells located in the bone marrow, which leads to the death of the tumor cells. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">If DNA methylation is not completely cleared during early development, its genomic effects could persist beyond the initial generation or organism in which it occurred. A sensitive period is a period of time during an organism's development when epigenetic marks can be changed; once these marks are set, they often can't be changed beyond this sensitive period. The two most sensitive periods during which epigenetic reprogramming occurs are germ cell development and early embryonic development. Changing epigenetic marks during sensitive periods can have unintended consequences; our current knowledge of how epigenetic marks influence gene expression, and the resulting health consequences, is far from complete, and treating patients using this technique during sensitive periods could potentially result in harmful unforeseen results. </div>
