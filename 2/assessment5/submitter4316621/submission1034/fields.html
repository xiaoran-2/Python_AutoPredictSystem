    <div class="field-value"><span>DNA
methylation is an epigenetic mechanism making the genes on and off. Methylated
CpG Island found on promoter region is associated with silencing of genes by binding
with methylated CpG binding proteins that will condense the chromatin or 
prohibit the transcription factor binding.  This helps in differential expression of genes
in different cell types. DNA methylation is essential for the formation of
heterochromatin, imprinting and X chromosome inactivation in normal cells. </span>

<p>DNA
methylation changes in cancer include CpG island hypermethylation and genome
wide hypomethylation. Cancer is essentially due to activation of oncogenes or
inactivation of tumour suppressor genes. CpG islands are mostly seen on the
promoter regions of tumour suppressor genes and in cancer cells the CpG islands
are seems to be hypermethylated leading to the silencing of the tumour
suppressor genes. Examples are hypermethylation of<em> MLH1</em> in Lynch syndrome and
<em>BRCA1</em> hypermethylation in breast cancer. Methylation of CpG islands becomes
dense as cancer progresses. </p>

<p><span>The
main function of DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements is
to maintain genomic integrity/ stability. Methylation at intergenic regions
silence cryptic transcription start sites and cryptic splice sites which will
cause transcription interference. Methylation of repetitive elements leads to
silencing and sometimes mutation which will protect the genome from
transposable elements, illegitimate recomposition and transcriptional
interference. Usually in normal cells the intergenic regions and repetitive
elements are hypermethylated. However, in cancer cells these regions are
commonly found to be hypomethylated leading to genomic instability. If the intergenic
elements/ repetitive elements are hypomethylated this will lead to deletions,
insertions, duplications, reciprocal translocations, formation of transposable
elements, illegitimate recomposition and transcriptional interference or aberrations
which will lead to cancer.  Global
methylation is found to gradually decrease with advancement of cancer.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Methylation
at imprint control regions bring about silencing or expression of imprint genes
and will determine whether it is maternally or paternally expressed. On
paternal allele the imprint control region of <i>Igf2</i> will be in methylated stage which will prevent attachment of
CTCF. CTCF insulates <i>igf2</i> from
downstream enhancers. Therefore on paternal allele enhancers will act on <i>igf2</i>
and there will be expression of <i>igf2</i>. Without CTCF,
methylation will spread to <i>H19</i>
promoters and there will be silencing of <i>H19</i>.
Whereas, hypomethylated imprint control region on maternal allele binds with
CTCF  which insulates <i>igf2</i>
from enhancers  and prevents <i>igf2</i> expression from
maternal allele. Instead of <i>igf2</i>, the
enhancers will activate <i>H19</i> from
maternal allele. <i>Igf2</i> is a growth
promoter or oncogene. If the maternal allele behaves like paternal allele (example:
Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome -no <i>Cdkn1c</i>
expression and over expression of <i>igf2</i>)
due to loss of imprinting this will lead to over expression of <i>igf2</i>, the growth promoting gene, from
both maternal and paternal alleles. May be due to mutation, uni parental disomy
or aberrant imprinting, maternal allele behaving like paternal allele leads to over expression of igf2 resulting in embryonic or childhood tumours- Wilms tumour in the kidney.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes are reversible
and are susceptible to chemical interventions. Epigenetic changes are passed on
during mitosis to next generations of cells until they are actively erased. As there is mitotic heritability, If
we can erase them, they would not return. Epigenetic therapies can result in altering
DNA methylation which stops a cancer growing. Actually this will convert the
cells to normal phenotype which will be then passed on during cell division to daughter
and granddaughter cells and they will behave as normal cells.</p>

<p> Sensitive
period is the period during which the erase and remethylation of the genome happens.
Epigenetic reprogramming occurs during gametogenesis (germ cell development) and after
fertilization (early embryonic development period) and these are the
sensitive periods of development. Drugs to make epigenetic changes are not
advisable during sensitive periods as they may disrupt epigenetic reprogramming and there may be unwanted gene expressions which may have life long consequences as during this period the entire genome is getting
erased of epigenetic marks and  acquire new . Epigenetic therapy during the period of gametogenesis may also lead to undesirable epigenetic changes in the gametes which may be inherited transgenerationally. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine
belongs to the class DNA methyl transferase inhibitors. They are nucleoside
analogues which get incorporated into DNA of actively replicating cells. And after
replication when the DNMT1 comes and binds to methylate the hemi methylated
strands, binding of the enzyme become irreversible and can no longer be
released. </p>

<p>Usually
in cancer cells there will be hypermethylation of the CpG islands. These
islands are seen on the promoter regions of tumour suppressor genes leading to
their silencing. Decitabine prevent the hypermethylation of CpG islands in
newly formed cells by inhibiting the action of DNMT1. As epigenetic changes are
passed during mitosis from one to next generation of cells, once we can erase
the methylation completely the same status will be passed onto next generation
of cells resulting from mitosis. There will be activation of tumour suppressor
genes in newly formed cells reverting them back to normal.</p>
