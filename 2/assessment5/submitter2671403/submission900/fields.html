    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><div>CpG islands have a high CpG density and are usually free of methylation. However, DNA methylation at CpG islands can be part of normal epigenetic process, as for example X- chomosome inactivation.</div><div>In cancer cells, promoter CpG islands become hypermethylated causing gene silencing. Since CpG islands are frequently localized at tumor suppressor genes, their hypermethylation can function as one ‘hit’ (Knudson hypothesis) and contribute to cancerigenesis ( for example: Rb in retinoblastoma, MLH1 in colorectal cancer).<br /></div><div>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements are involved in maintaining genomic stability and prevent illegitimate recombinations between chromosomes. In cancer, we can observe hypomethylation at those sites, which causes genomic instability (illegitimate recombination between repeats, repeat activation an transposition, and cryptic promoter activation, can then take place).<br /><br />Reference: Epigenetic control of gene expression - Week 7.

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>DNA methylation changes at imprint control regions (ICRs) (hypo or hypermethylation) can cause loss of expression of growth suppressor genes or overexpression of growth promoter genes – with expression of both maternal and paternal alleles or silencing of both.</div><div>Considering the H19/Igf2 cluster, the ICR is methylated on the paternal allele, and the enhancers can act on Igf2, because CTCF is not binding to inhibit this. In this way, Igf2 is expressed.</div><div>The ICR is unmethylated on the maternal allele. When unmethylated CTCF binds its insulator element, the enhancers will act on H19, so Igf2 will be silent for the maternal allele (no expression).<br /></div><div>In Wilm’s tumor we can find hypermethylation of the ICR also on the maternal allele, so we have expression of Igf2 on the maternal allele.<br /></div><div>Igf2 is a growth promoter, and by disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster we obtain a double dose of Igf2 that contributes to cancer development - in this case, a type of kidney cancer usually diagnosed at young age (Wilm’s tumor).<br /><br />Reference: Epigenetic control of gene expression - Week 7.Hypermethylation of sets of CpG islands in cancer<br /><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Decitabine is a DNMT1 (DNA methyltransferase 1) inhibitor FDA approved for the treatment of AML after myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).</div><div>Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue that gets incorporated into the DNA upon replication. When DNMT1 binds to that nucleotide to copy the meyhylation to the daughter strand, it gets irreversibly bound and can’t be released. The action of decitabine is division dependent – the cell has to be replicating. Its anti-tumor effect is by DNA demethylation ( it may also have other mechanisms of action). Cancer cells, which divide more rapidly than normal cells, will be more severely affected. The reason why this drug is active in MDS may be because heavy CpG islands hypermethylation is a poor prognostic factor for MDS.<br /><br />Reference: Epigenetic control of gene expression - Week 7.

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>These drugs can have enduring effects, beyond the period of drug treatment, because epigenetic changes are mitotically inheritable. Every cell has the potential to be affected by these drugs, so one has to be especially careful with younger patients, particularly those with developing germ cells.<br /></div><div>Sensitive periods of epigenetic reprogramming are those periods associated with almost complete erasure of methylation marks followed by de novo methylation of the genome. </div><div>There are two critical periods of epigenetic reprogramming: gametogenesis and early embryogenesis. In gametogenesis this reprogramming is important in order reset gene imprinting in germ cells.</div><div>Treating patients with developing germ cells or a pregnant woman in early pregnancy with epigenetic drugs can affect epigenetic mechanisms during these periods, and that may cause significant effects on embryonic development.<br /><br />Reference: Epigenetic control of gene expression - Week 4, and <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=21333735">Brain Behav Immun.
