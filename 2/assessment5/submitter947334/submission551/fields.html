    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are usually kept free of methylation and promote the expression of the underlying gene (i.e. the one that follows). However, in cancer cells CpG islands are mostly hypermethylated, which in turn causes silencing of the underlying gene. Those could be the genes coding tumor suppressors (controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair) - so this "fail-safe measure" of the cell is turned off by the change.<br />DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is speculated to repress transcriptional noice from alternative start sites, inhibit antisense transcription and decrease the rate of gene expression. In cancer these epigenetic sites tend to be hypomethylated. This induces pluripotent stem cell-like behaviour (expressing genes other than are normally active in the mother tissue), may promote oncogenes' expression (e.g. promoting for growth) and, in case of repetitive elements, may cause crossover with other DNA strands (not just complimentary one).</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">On the paternal allele this imprint control region is methylated, which prevents CTCF protein from binding to it and causes DNA methylation to spread to H19 lncRNA promoter, silencing it. This allows the enhancers to access lgf2gene and express it.<br />On maternal allele the pattern is opposite - imprint control region is unmethylated, which allows CTCF insulator protein to bind, silencing lgf2 expression and promoting H19 expression.<br />In Wilm's tumour both alleles display paternal methylation pattern.<br />This means that the patient ends up with double doze of lgf2 (which is oncogene), and, as H19/lgf2 cluster is linked with Kcnq1, those patients also lack Cdkn1c expression (which is a tumor suppressor)</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent - so it reduces DNA methylation. In case of CpG islands' active demethylation this can reactivate the expression of tumour suppressor genes</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic marks are mytotically heritable - so once the methylation marks are altered, all daughter cells (of the treated one) will have them already corrected.<br />A "sensitive period" is a period when these marks are erased or established - there are 2 in case of mammals: primordial germ cell development (mid-gestation) and early development (from fertilised egg to blastocyst stage)<br />Treating the patients in these periods would be inadvisable due to the risk of incomplete epigenetic reprogramming or mistake in imprinting, leading to various disorders.</div>
