    <h1>Submission 144 from Anon (session_user_id: b4a4b2353c3ee9cabc42a1cd94f671fed783dc1d)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Methylations gives stability and help imprinting. </span>CpG sites in the CpG islands of promoters are often free from methylation independently of their activity state. CpG sites in the promoter region of a gene gets hypermethlyated in cancer cells. DNA methylation is an alternative to genetic
mutation, to silence tumour suppressor genes
in cancer. <br />In the case of CpG islands and CpG island shores of tumor suppressor genes, islands are unmethylated and intergenic regions and repetitive elements stays methylated in a normal cell. That is opposite in the cancer cell, the CpG islands are methylated and the intergenic regions and repetitive elements stays unmethylated. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at ICRs can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes, overexpression of growth promoting genes. In pre-neoplastic tissue if hypermethylation of ICR, gives Igf2 over expressed as in Wilm’s tumor. In Wilm's tumor the CTCF is methylated on the maternal allele, so the patent will have two alleles that are methylated, since the paternal allele is methylated in the imprinting control region. And the enhancer that in a normal cell would work on H19 will now work on Igf2. Igf2 is expressed and promote growth.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent and can only be incorporated in to DNA strands (not RNA).  It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA Methyltransferase.<span><br />Since epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to down stream generation cells until they are actively erased, epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.</span><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>

		DNA methylation and chromatine remodeling, not always heritable, but methylation of cytosines can pass from the germ line of one of the parents into the zygote. Heritability of methylation state depends on some enzymes (DNMT1) that have a higher affinity for 5-methylcytosine than for cytosine. If this enzyme reaches one part of DNA the enzyme will methylate the other half.<p>Sensitive periods, 'when altered environments
have an effect on epigenetic control'. 1.Primordial germ cell development to production of mature sperm/egg. 2. Preimplantation and early post implantation. <br /></p><p>Treating a patient during this sensitive time can give very unspecific result.  If one would like to methylate and suppress one gene at this stage, the drug must be very specific and only methylate that gene that causes the problem. The same for unmethylation, any external stress can change methylation status and the gene expression that follows can be higher  than the desired effect. And to be sure that the right dose is administrated for the desired effect must be very difficult.</p><p><br /></p>
