    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally DNA methylation at CpG islands (that are found in
many promoter sites) is minimal, whether or not they are active. </p>

<p>In cancer this process is disrupted due to hypermethylation.
 Hypermethylation leads to silent genes
downstream of the promoter. </p>

<p>This disruption contributes to cancer if there are tumour
suppressor genes silenced. </p>

<p>DNA methylation has variable roles in intergenic regions and
repetitive elements. It has been noted in cancer, that overall there is reduced
methylation, though specific sites are hypermethylated.  Resulting instability leads to changes in key
cell functions such as DNA repair, cell cycle control and apoptosis. </p>

<p>In peripheral nerve sheath tumours, specific hypomethylation
of satellite repeats is present.  Hypermethylation
in colorectal, glioma and breast cancer can be seen at CpG repeats, forming
CIMPS CpG island methylator phenotype) and microsattelite instability.  </p>

<p>Intergenic regions with lincRNA change their activity due to
methylation and acetylation, and are now known to be very important for cell
differentiation, and pluripotent potential. Since many tumours regress to a
very blastic form of cell type, a de-differentiation may occur due to
malfunction of the lncRNA and lincRNA areas. This may hold clues to the way
cells become forever cells and do not undergo apoptosis. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Insulin like growth factor in the mouth has been studied extensively with H19 being the non coding regulator gene upstream of Igf2. H19 acts a a tumour suppressor so in Wilm's tumour, it is not acting due to methylation.  Only the father's igf2 is expressed, so is less methylated, while the dams H19 is expressed so it is less methylated than the heavily methylated paternal H19 copy. If the maternal H19 becomes methylated and thus inactive, allowing both Igf2 alleles to be active. Silencing of tumour suppressor genes in that instance allowing the kidney tumour to grow.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>

</span><p><span>This is in an epigenetic acting class of
drugs, and during S phase it blocks increased DNA methylation that is typical
in tumours. By being an analog of the DNA bases, it can insert into DNA and
irreversibly binds to provide DNA methyltransferase inactivation.   </span></p>

<p>This gives it anti tumour effect by reversing
methylation and thus reactivate tumour suppressor genes. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altered
methylation of the DNA using their combination of epigenetic drugs azacitidine
and a histone deaceytylase inhibitor, can have enduring effects epigentically
by increasing responsiveness to subsequent chemotherapeutic agents.  This mechanism occurs in a yet undefined
mechanism, resulting in not death of cells but just stopped the cancer growth. The sensitive periods of development are when interventions in the epigenetic methylation would result in effects on all cells not just tumour cells, which is undesirable.  Such a time is when the gametes are merged and early in the development process X inactivation and imprinted genes are selectively methylated. </div>
