    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands
are found in approximately 60% of promoters, and are usually kept without methylating,
therefore allowing the expression of the underlying gene. However, in cancer
cells these CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated, what lock the gen in a silent
state. These CpG islands usually are in the promoter of tumor suppressor genes.
When they are hypermethylated, like in cancer occurs, the tumor suppressor
genes are silent, favoring the development of the cancer.</p>

<p><span>Intergenic
regions and repetitive elements usually are methylated in order to maintain the
genomic stability, avoiding the gain or the loss of chromosomes or the
appearance of illegitimate recombinations,… Whereas in cancer, these intergenic
regions and repetitive regions are hypomethylated. The consequence would be
illegitimate recombination between repeats, reciprocal translocations between
two different chromosomes,…  Recombination
only happen between identic genomic regions, when repetitive elements are
methylated, so heterochromatonized and then too densely packed, this recombination
could not happen. However, due to the hypomethylation of the intergenic regions
and repetitive elements, the illegitimate recombination could take place
because these regions would not be densely packed. In addition, due to the
hypomethylation the repeats can be active, make a copy of themselves and jump
around the genome, disrupting the coding regions of genes or activating
neighbor genes. Summering, in the cancer context will be general genomic
instability.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is imprinting in the paternal allele. What it means
that CTCF and H19 are methylated on the paternal allele, so packed and inaccessible
for the enhancers placed downstream, then these enhancers will act on Igf2
placed upstream of CTCF and H19, so we will see expression of Igf2. However, in
the maternal allele CTCF and H19 are unmethylated. Therefore CTCF binds his
insulator element and the enhancer downstream will act on H19 instead of acting
on Igf2, which is far away upstream. So we will not have expression of Igf2.</p>

<span>In Wilm´s tumor, there is
loss of imprinting, because of the hypermethylation of the imprint control
region on the maternal allele. Therefore Igf2 will be expressed too in the
maternal allele. In this tumor we will have a double dose of the growth
promoter: Igf2 compare with a normal cell.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine
is a DNA-demethylating agent (DNA methyltransferase inhibitors), that is used
to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursor of acute myelogenous
leukaemia. In cancer, It has described an hypermethylation
of CpG island (and/or of CpG island shore) in the control region of the tumor
suppressor genes; therefore these genes, whose job is to stop the uncontrolled
cell growth that causes cancer, are silenced. This drug decrease the
number of the methyl groups in the DNA, allowing the expression of the <span>tumor suppressor genes. It would be the anti-tumor effect.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Epigenetic
drugs could have effect that last beyond the period of drug treatment because
the modification in the DNA methylation are mitotically inheritable. In cancer,
cells are growing in an uncontrolled way, the drug effect on the DNA
methylation of the mother cell will be transmit to the daughters, and so on,
even if the drug treatment is interrupted.  However, there are two sensitive period where
the epigenetic marks are cleared and reset again, what is known as epigenetic
reprograming. This periods are the primordial germ cells development and the
early embryonic development (before the embryo </span>implants
and makes a placenta).</p>

<p><span>During the
gametogenesis it occurs a simultaneous demethylation of the paternal and
maternal genome but a differential resetting in spermatogenesis vs oogenesis,
and the demethylation and methylation of the imprinting genes. If we alter the DNA
methylation level at this moment with a treatment probably the gametes will be
abnormal and probably the future embryo will not be viable. Modification of the
DNA methylarion level during early embryonic development could cause abnormalities
in the new person but not the death, depending on the alteration in the DNA methylation.</span></p></div>
