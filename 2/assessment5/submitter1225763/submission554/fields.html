    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Typically, there are CpG islands found throughout the mammalian genome, with their frequent location in the promoter regions of the genes. Methylation of CpG correlates with the expression of the gene. Thus, in normal cells tumor supressor gene promoter is unmethylated and oncogene promoter is methylated. <br />However, in the cancer cells the methylation of CpG gets disrupted and constitute an opposite picture: the CpG islands in the tumor supressor genes promoters get hypermethylated and, therefore, the genes are not expressed, while CpG islands in the oncogene promoters lose methylation (get hypomethilated) and are being expressed. This way the cancer cells can multiply uncontrollably and escape dying. <br />As for intergenic regions and repetitive elements, in the normal cells they are methylated, and  this way genomic stability is sustained. In contrast, in cancer cells intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated, and this can result in insertions, deletions and reciprocral translocations, which disrupt normal functioning of the genes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprinted genes<span> are genes whose expression is determined by the parent that contributed them. So, in the example of </span> <span>H19/Igf2 cluster, in the paternal allele the imprint control region (ICR) is normally methylated and the enhancers act on Igf2. In the maternal allele ICR is not methylated, so enhancers act on H19, which prevents expression of Igf2. So normally the Igf2 gene is expressed only from paternal allele. In <br /></span><span>Wilm’s tumour ICR on the maternal allele gets hypermethylated, therefore Igf2 is expressed on both paternal and maternal allele. And Igf2 is growth promoting, so with the double dose of the gene this specific kidney tumor in kids can grow uncontrollably.</span><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a drug acting as a DNA demethylation agent. Although they don't say much about <span>Decitabine in the article, to my undestanding it reduces the DNA methylation in the promoters, where DNA is not supposed to be methylated and, thus the genes may be expressed again (for example, tumo supressor genes)</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The special feature of epigenetic marks, including DNA methylation, is that they are transmitted from the originally epigenetically transformed cell to daughter cells via mitosis. Thus, if DNA methylation is altered in any way by a drug in one cell, this effect is transmitted to all the daughter and granddaughter,etc. cells of this cell. This explains the possible enduring effects on the epigenome. However, this kind of drugs should be used with extreme cautiousness, because there are sensitive periods for epigenome. The researchers and pharmaceutical companies should realise that in children germ cells are still being formed and establishment and preservation of epigenetic marks are essential. If they are removed by the drugs, they don't come back, which may result in abnormalities in the following generations.</div>
