    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell, CpG islands preceding gene promoters are hypomethylated, meaning you usually do not see methylation in those CpG islands. In a cancer cell, CpG islands are more likely to be methylated in the promoters of tumor suppressing genes while CpG methylation of oncogene promoter regions and repeat elements is lower in many cases. Since DNA methylation is a silencing epigenetic mark, t<span>hese cells are more likely to divide more and faster and die less which makes them cancerous.<br />Most of the genome is not made of CpG islands but </span>of intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br />In a normal cell, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated in order to maintain genomic stability. In a cancer cell these regions tend to be hypomethylated, meaning you usually see less methylation in those regions compare to a normal cell. The result of that is illegitimate recombination between repeats which can result in deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations. The repeats can also be activated because of the hypomethylation and make a copy of themselves and jump around the genome, which may interrupt other genes and activate neighboring  genes.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell, the paternal allele of the <span>H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated which causes silencing of the H19 gene and the expression of the lgf2 gene due to the enhancers. </span>The maternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster, on the other hand is unmethylated which causes silencing of the lgf2 gene and the expression of the H19 gene due to the enhancers.<br />In a cancer cell we see a loss of imprinting which causes the imprint control region to be hypermethylated on the maternal allele as well, and it ends up silencing of the H19 gene and the expression of the lgf2 gene just like the paternal allele.<br />Since Igf2 is growth promoting, and now we have a double douse of it, this contributes to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors class. It is a nuceloside analog and is incorporated into the DNA at time of replication.<br />When the cell divides and the DNA methyltransferase tries to copy the methylation to the daughter strand it is bound and can no longer be released.<br />Since cancer cells divide more rapidly than regular cells they are affected by this much more than regular cells. It has an anti tumor effect since they cause demethylation and thus remove some of the cancerous characteristics of the cell.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. It is being copied by the DNA methyltransferase and passed on during cell division to the daughter cells  again and again. The drugs in the article demethylated the DNA so that at every division there were more and more cells with no methylation until the methylation marks are actively erased. So altering the DNA methylation will have an affect on all the daughter cells of a dividing cell, this having a long term effect.<br />A sensitive period is a period in the development when the environment may influence epigenetic makeup. This occurs during pre-implentation and primordial germ cell development and in the production of germ cells later in life.<br />During the sensitive periods, we are more susceptible to environment changes and if we use drugs that alter the epigenome we are able to influence not only the cancerous cells but the healthy development of normal cells.<br /><br /><br /></div>
