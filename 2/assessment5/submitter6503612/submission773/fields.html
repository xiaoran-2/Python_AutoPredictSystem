    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value">Generally in healthy cells DNA is globally methylated and CpG islands at promoter regions are hypomethylated to allow gene expression. When CpG islands are hypermethylated they silence the gene and when they are hypomethylated they activate expression. Whether a gene is supposed to be expressed or not depends on the function. In cancer there is an aberrant methylation pattern of different genes and DNA tends to become globally unmethylated and hypermethylated at CpG islands. In cancer, hypermethylation of a t<em>umor suppression gene</em> CpG island would silence its expression and wouldn't be able to stop tumor growth. On the oner hand, hypomethylation of an <em>oncogene</em> and <em>growth factors</em> would enhance expression and promote tumor growth. <br />Intergenic regions, and repetitive elements are normally methylated in healthy cells to give stability to the gene (chromosome structure and integrity by better packing and not permitting transcription factors or other factor to bind to sites), when in cancer this regions become hypomethylated  and cause an instability which can allow for mutations or aberrant expression of genes as normally condensed DNA is now exposed.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the paternal allele the ICR between H19 and Igf2 is methylated and this methylation is spread to H19 promoter region which leads to silencing of H19, silencing of H19 allows for enhancers to access Igf2 and activates its expression.<br />At the maternal allele the ICR region is unmethylated which allows binding of CTCF which functions as an insulator protein that blocks enhancers from binding to Igf2. This enhancers instead bind to unmethylated H19 and promote its expression.<br />In cancer, and in Wilms tumor specifically there is a loss of maternal imprinting that causes both alleles to function as paternal and therefore an over expression if Igf2. This over expression of a Igf2 that functions as a growth factor contributes to aberrant cell growth and division in the development of the tumor and cancer.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is cytidine analog and functions as a <span>DNA-demethylating agent. It hypomethylates DNA by blocking DNMT. Is is usually used for myelodysplastic syndrome. It can have an anti-tumor effect by hypomethylating promoter regions of<em> tumor suppressor genes</em> that have been silenced through hypermethylation of their CpG island. Allowing for a tumor suppressor gene to be reexpressed it can help a cell have better control over its current aberrant cell division.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark that can be conserved through cell division, so it is said to be heritable. Some drugs can be used to change this heritable marks to treat cancer. In the normal development there are 2 sensitive periods where epigenetic marks are erased and reestablished for future cell lineage, this two periods occur during early embryogenesis and germ cell development so the use of drugs that modify DNA methylation should be avoided during these period to prevent abnormal cell differentiation.</div>
