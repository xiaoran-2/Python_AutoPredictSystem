    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is altered in cancer under the
two broad categories of locus specific DNA hypermethylation and genome-wide DNA
hypomethylation.</p>

<p>For locus specific hypermethylation, this refers
specifically to CpG islands of tumour supressor genes and loss of imprinting at
ICRs (Imprint Control Regions). </p>

<p>CpG islands are generally found at the promoters
of tumour suppressor genes. In normal tissue, these CpG islands are
hypomethylated which results in the tumour suppressor genes being expressed and
able to carry out their growth controlling function. If these CpG islands
become hypermethylated, this leads to the inactivation of the tumour suppressor
genes and uncontrolled growth, which contributes to the development of cancer. </p>

<p>Many imprinted genes have functions as growth
promoting or growth restricting genes. In imprinting, methylation of ICRs is
used to control monoallelic parent-of-origin specific gene expression. In
hypermethylation of ICRs, and subsequent loss of imprinting, there is loss of
monoallelic parent-of-origin specific gene expression which results in overexpression/loss
of expression from both alleles of growth related genes which can contribute to
cancer.</p>

<p>For genome-wide DNA hypomethylation, this refers
specifically to hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements
and loss of imprinting at ICRs. </p>

<p>In normal tissue, intergenic regions and repetitive elements of the genome are
quite heavily methylated. This hypermethylation is an important mechanism in
silencing cryptic promoters in
intergenic regions, silencing repeats to prevent transposition, and in general maintaining genomic integrity (preventing
reciprocal translocations, deletions, insertions etc). When there is a general
hypomethylation of these regions across the genome, this in turn leads to
genomic instability, which contributes to the development of cancer.</p>

<p>In hypomethylation of ICRs, and subsequent loss
of imprinting, there is loss of monoallelic parent-of-origin specific gene
expression which can result in overexpression/loss of expression from both
alleles for growth related genes which can contribute to cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Many imprinted genes have functions as growth
promoting/growth restricting genes. In imprinting, methylation of one ICR is used to
control monoallelic parent-of-origin specific gene expression. <br /></p><p>Igf2 is a growth promoting gene. In the case of the H19/Igf2 cluster, in
the normal scenario, it is the paternal allele which is imprinted, as its ICR
is methylated. CTCF is an insulator protein, which binds at an
unmethylated ICR and acts to insulate Igf2 from downstream enhancers. For the
paternal methylated ICR, the CTCF protein cannot bind at this point and downstream
enhancers are free to act on Igf2 and promote its expression. The ICR methylation also spreads to the downstream H19
promoter to silence it. On the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated and is
bound by CTCF and so Igf2 is insulated from the downstream enhancers and is
inactive. Since there is no methylation of the H19 promoter this is expressed on
the maternal allele.

</p><p>In
the case of Wilm’s tumour, there is hypermethylation of both ICRs on both
alleles which results in loss of imprinting. This results in a double dose of
Igf2, a growth promoting gene, compared to normal. This
overexpression of Igf2 contributes to the development of cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine
is a DNMTi, DNA Methyl Transferase inhibitor, drug.  DNMTs are enzymatic epigenetic regulators involved in the laying down/maintenance of methylation in the genome. In cancer, there are often regions of
hypermethylation in the genome contributing to the development of cancer. <br />Decitabine,
being a nucleoside analogue, gets incorporated into the DNA upon cell replication,
and irreversibly binds DNMTs. Binding DNMTs prevents them from carrying out
their normal function of DNA methylation maintenance in daughter cells. Since
decitabine is replication dependent, its action tends to more severely affect
cancer cells since cancer cells divide much more rapidly than other cells in
the body. In cancer, since hypermethylation of CpG islands are generally
found at the promoters of tumour suppressor genes leading to their silencing,
the use of this drug has an anti-tumour effect as it contributes to the
demethylation of these hypermethylated CpG islands and the reactivation of
tumour suppressor genes.

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have
effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment since these drugs help
reverse an epigenetic alteration and epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable by daughter cells until they are actively erased. Once an epigenetic
alteration is erased, it does not return.</p>

<p>However, these drugs have a systemic effect on
epigenetic control across all cells of all tissues and this is an important
point to bear in mind during sensitive periods, as this may result in
long-term, undesired side-effects. Sensitive periods are periods during which
epigenetic reprogramming/changes take place in development. Pre-natal, these sensitive periods are clearing/reprogramming of
epigenetic marks during early embryonic development and primordial germ cell
development. From post-natal to young adulthood, there is likely many sensitive
periods key to normal development. We are
probably not fully aware of the full extent of these sensitive periods at
present. Given the drug effects on DNA methylation, this could effect the mitotic heritability of normal epigenetic changes
 during sensitive periods of normal development. Given that
these drugs would present a significant environmental assault on the epigenetic machinery, their
use is inadvisable during sensitive periods of development for younger patients, as well as pregnant patients.<br /></p>
