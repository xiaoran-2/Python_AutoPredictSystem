    <div class="field-value">Normal functional CpG islands in typical cells are hypomethylated preceding gene promoters which allow epigenetic regulators e.g. CIMP. DNA
methylation can increase over time as a result of such things such a inflammation, normal aging process and/or environmental insults e.g. smoking or repeated sunburns: which over years can cause unnecessary cell divisions, each cell division epigenetic changes can occur so increasing methylation can potentially occur in CpG islands disrupting normal protein expression of a  tumor suppressor proteins with bad results - cancer. If the CpG island becomes methylated/hypermethylated then the Imprint Control Region (ICR) transcription becomes silenced, it can result lost of the expression of growth restricting genes, cancer can be the result, <br /><br />Normal genomes tend to be hypermethylation between the intergenic regions and repetitive elements, so genome is heterochromatin - compact leading to normal genomic stability, recombination, repeat, transposition, promoters and disruption all happen or don't happen due to hypermethylation of these region. But if the epigenetics are modified due to damage via environment, inflammation or even normal wear and tear in daily living. It can lead to a loss of methylation intergenic regions and repetitive elements resulting in hypomethylation - euchromatin results with potentially bad results. This can lead to genomic instability depending on the context of where is methylation changes happening. Resulting in illegitimate recombination between repeats, deletions or insertions allowing a new suite of proteins to be express  such as DNMT3B or R-RAS. Depleation of DNA methylation can suppress tumorigensis, but on the other hand could lead to a tumor - just depend where the methylation happens or doesn't. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Disruption of imprinting can happen in a number of ways and contribute to cancer, one way is enhance blocking such as H19/igf2 cluster. On the paternal allele upstream of H19 is a ICR if it becomes methylated by <span>heterochromatin </span>spreading H19 is then methylated and silenced. Since ICR is methylated CTCF is unable to bind to ICR to provide insulating blocking to H19 so downstream enhancers from can then act on igf2 - this is a secondary chromatin loop. On the  maternal side ICR is not methylated hence CTCF can bind to it and provide blocking to from igf2 and no methylated spreading happens so H19 is active, enhancers can act on it.<br /><br />Wilm's tumor - both the maternal and paternal alleles have methylated ICR by H19 as describe above for paternal, so a double dose of of igf2 happens and igf2 products when express is a growth promoters - leading potentially to cancer.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to a class of medications called hypomethylation agents. Decitabine is a hypomethlating agent, it hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase other words interfering with the methylation of DNA. 
            By this process of demethylation, normal function to the tumor suppressor genes
            is restored, thus restoring control over cell growth. It changes the epigenetic character of the gene so over time, the cell will become normal as it divides - mitosis<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Am. J. Trans Res 2011;3(2):166-179 spoke to the method how Histone acetylation and/or deacetylation work by altering the histone charges negative back to positive; while DNA is more negatively charge causing Histone compact DNA - reducing the transcriptional machinery; silencing the run away cell production aka cancer. The tumor suppressor proteins p53, RUNX3 can be expressed more normal. These actions happen when the combination of histone-deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine are administer. As said previously alterations happen to the histone - changing the charges. What is happening is the epigenetic drug therapy is trying to coach the cells back to normal. Since the meds are effecting epigenetics - changes are passed down to new cell generations aka mitosis. The mitosis altered 'corrected epigenetic' cell will still live beyond the end of drug therapy.<br /><br />Sensitive period are during first 10 days of germ cell development, most of the epigenetic marks are clear during the. Epigenetic drugs are inadvisable if you are pregnant or planning to have a baby or a young person up to 11-13 year, since the sex cells are still maturing. Males shouldn't try to have children for at least to 2 months after treatment with an epigenetic drug.<br /><br /></div>
