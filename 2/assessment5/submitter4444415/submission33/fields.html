    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value">Normally, DNA methylation at CpG islands serves to silence genes. CpG islands are often located within the promoters of genes, so silencing occurs by blocking transcription factors from binding and promoting transcription via DNA methylation. In cancer cells, CpG islands display hypermethylation. This disruption can contribute to cancer development by silencing tumor suppressors, effectively creating an oncogene without a mutation to the genetic code of the suppressor itself.<br /><br />Normally, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated in order to promote genomic stability (their silencing prevents dangers discussed further). When repeats are hypomethylated in cancer cells, recombination, usually prevented due to the hiding of repeats in heterochromatin, can occur and lead to genomic instability. Hypomethylation can also activate these repetitive regions, causing them to jump around the genome (transpose) and potentially insert themselves into genes critical for regulating growth. In some cases, repeats can insert themselves into tumor suppressor genes, resulting in a loss of function.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated. In the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated. When unmethylated, the ICR is covered by CTCF protein. This results in blocked expression of Igf2 and increased expression of H19. In contrast, enhancers are not blocked by CTCF and can act on the Igf2 locus in the paternal allele, resulting in expression of Igf2. H19 is methylated in the paternal allele, resulting in no expression of H19 from the paternal allele.<br /><br />In cases where the maternal allele behaves like the paternal allele due to an abnormal imprinting pattern, Igf2 is over expressed. The overexpression of this growth factor can contribute to cancer development (abnormal growth factor expression is a hallmark of many cancers). More specifically, children with abnormal imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster are more prone to Wilm's tumour.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent that results in DNA hypomethylation when used. In an abnormal epigenome, where a variety of tumor suppressor genes have become hypermethylated on their DNA sequences, the risk of tumor development is greatly heightened. By applying Decitabine, tumors can have an anti-tumor effect by demethylating tumor suppressor genes that have been epigenetically silenced.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have an enduring effect on the epigenome because their effects are mitotically heritable. DNA methylation is maintained in subsequent daughter cells through polycomb repressive complexes. After the duplication of a cell's genome during mitosis, PRC1 and PRC2 reestablish the methylation patterns of the cells by methylating nucleotides opposite to already methylated ones. In this maner, hemi-methylated sequences are converted to the methylation patterns of the original sequence.<br /><br />Sensitive periods of development are time spans during which the epigenome is most susceptible to environmental signals. The two sensitive periods are during primordial germ cell development and during fetal development. Treating patients during a sensitive period (e.g. prescribing Decitabine to a pregnant woman) is inadvisable because the treatment has a high potential to induce epigenetic changes in not only the patient but also subsequent generations. Further, the patient is in need of treatment but their progeny may have an otherwise healthy epigenome that could be damaged by epigeneticall active agents. <br /></div>
