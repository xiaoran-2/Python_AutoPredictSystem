    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell the CpG islands in the genome are usually
hypomethylated. CpG islands are found in the promoter region of many
genes. So hypomethylation results in the expression of the gene.  Also, the intergeneic regions and repetitive regions in the genome
are hypermethylated in a normal cell . This results in silencing of repetitive elements and elements in intergenic regions.This helps to maintain genomic
stability as hypermethylation of repetitive regions results in
failure in illegitimate recombination and failure in transposition
thus leading to normal gene expression.However in case of cancer
cells the DNA methylation is altered. The usual  hypomethylated CpG
islands are hypermethylated and the intergeneic regions like CpG poor
promoters and  repetitive elements which are hypermethylated in a
normal cell are hypomethyalted . As CpG isalnds are found in promoters of genes hypermethylation
leads to  silencing of tumour suppressing genes thus contributing to
cancer. Also, the hypomethylation of the repetitive elements leads to
genomic instability. This is because of illegitimate recombination
between the repeats. Also as the repettive elements are now
hypomethylated , translocations are possible and this also
contributes to genomic recombination contributing to cancer.  Also
these can act as cryptic promoters for oncogenes(as in mouse to Avy )
thus leading to cancer. The hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters can
resultin activation of oncogenes thus leading to cancer.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>
In
cancer there is loss of imprinting. Hence the monoallelic expression
of genes is stopped and it is either biallelic expression or no
expression at all. Now in cancer there is loss of imprinting of the
Igf2 gene which is a growth promroter gene . In normal cells Igf2
gene is expressed from the paternal allele and the expression is
silenced on the maternal allele.In
normal cells in paternal allele,The ICR of the paternal allele is
methylated and hence the CTCF which is a insulator protein cannot
bind to it and hence the enhancers act upon the Igf2 gene and its
expression takes place. Also  the methylation of the ICR spreads
to the promoter of H19 gene leading to its silencing. However in the
maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated and hence the CTCF proteins
binds to  the ICR which  blocks the action of enhancers on the
Igf2 gene and  CTCF proteins direct  action of enhancers on H19
gene leading to its expression. Now in case of
wilm's tumour  imprinting is lost and the ICR in the maternal
allele also gets methylated thus leading to biallelic expression of Igf2 gene. This
contributes to cancer as Igf2 gene is growth promoter gene. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>As mentioned in the article the Decitabine drug is an epigenetic
inhibitor which is used in the treatment of cancer. The Dectabine is
a DNA methylation inhibitor or an DNA demethylation agent which helps
to stop the DNA methylation in the CpG islands . As we know that in
cancer cells the DNA methylation is altered . The normally
hypomethylated CpG islands are hypermethylated in case of cancer
cells and as the CpG islands are found in the promoter of many tumour
suppressing genes ,the tumour supressing genes are silenced
contributing to cancer. Now Dectabine specifically acts on these
sites and removes the methylation at these CpG islands leading to
expression of tumour suppressing genes and thus contributing in
treatment of cancer. Decitabine binds to the DNMT the DNA methyltransferase irreversibly and inhibits its action and hence it is replication dependent. Decitabine is used in the treatment of myelodysplastic
syndrome.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark and it is mitotically
heritable. This means epigenetic changes are transferred to the
daughter and the grand-daughter cells . When the epigenetic machinery
inhibits DNA methylation by irreversibly binding to DNMT this
epigenetic change is carried over the daughter cells and the
granddaughter cells as well. Thus it can have effects last beyond the
drug treatment . However the drug treatment is inadvisable during the
sensitive periods of human development. Sensitive perriods are
periods of heavy epigenetic reprogrammng that is erasing existing
marks and setting up of new marks. The sensitive periods include the
early development of the embryo till the epiblast and also the
period in which the primordial germ cells are developing. These are
times of heavy epigenetic reprogramming . If  epigenetic drugs are
used in these periods , this may affect not only the cancer cells but
also in the other cells the epigenetic machinery would be altered
leading to abnormal setting of epigenetic marks thus leading to
various other  disorders. <br /></p></div>
