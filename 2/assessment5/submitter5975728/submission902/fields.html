    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cells the majority of the CpG dinucleotides are methylated and the methylation of the CpG islands in the promoter regions is associated with the silencing of the genes. In cancer CpG islands are hypermethylated. The hypermethylation of CpG can lead to silencing of tumour suppressor genes that control cell cycle, maintain the cell proliferation and apoptosis and in this way to contributes the development of cancer.<br />DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is important for maintaining the stability and integrity of the genome. In cancer cells intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated and in this way the stability of the genome is impaired. The genomic instability is characterized by activation of the repeats,recombination of the repeats, activation of transposable elements and cryptic promotoers, which induce impaired expression of neighbouring genes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine acts like a DNA-demethylating agent or hypomethylating agent, which inhibits DNA methyltransferase. Decitabine reduce the CpG methylation in patients with <span>acute myelogenous leukaemia, who show hypermethylation in these regions and contribute to activation of apoptosis of the tumour cells.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable and they are passed through cell divisions. This means that DNA methylation can be inherited by daughter cells and the effect of the epigenetic drug to be longer than the standard chemotherapy. Sensitive periods in development important for epigenetic are primordial germ cell development and early embryo development, when epigenetic reprogramming occurs. This means that treating of younger patients, who are developing germ cells or pregnant women can affect future generations and it is not advisable.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">H19 and Igf2 are cluster of imprinted genes which are regulated by imprinting control region (IRC). H19 is maternally expressed, while Igf2 is paternally expressed. On the paternal allele IRC is methylated and correspondingly Igf2 is expressed. When IRC is methylated the transcriptional factor CTCF can not bind it and the distal enhancers promote expression of Igf2. On maternal allele the IRC is not methylated and CTCF binds to the IRC, which lead to expression of H19  and not of Igf2. In Wilm's tumour IRC is hypermethylated on Igf2 is bi-allelic expressed, whereas H19 is not expressed. Igf2 gene encode insuline-like growth factor 2 that stimulates cell growth.</div>
