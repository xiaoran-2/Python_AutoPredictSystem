    <h1>Submission 764 from Anon (session_user_id: 598cf9076e747c3fe2f046153c4f9312e969bcd3)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is  FDA approved for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Decitabine belongs to both, DNMT inhibitors ( hypomethylating agents) and  the category of chemotherapy called antimetabolites. One way            that it works is by demethylation or interfering with the methylation of DNA.             By this process of hypomethylation, normal function to the tumor suppressor genes            is restored, thus restoring control over cell growth, in other words, reactivation of epigenetically silenced tumor supressor genes induced by the
hypothemylation.
<p> </p>

<p>Antimetabolites are very similar to normal substances within the cell.  When            the cells incorporate these substances into the cellular metabolism, they interact            with a number of targets within the cell to produce a direct cytotoxic effect that            causes death of rapidly dividing cancer cells. </p><p>Thus, Decitabine produces its anticancer  effects by causing a chemical reaction that damages the DNA in a cell. The DNA  damage caused by decitabine inhibits protein synthesis and results in cellular  death.        </p></div>

    <div class="field-value"><p></p><span></span><p>DNA
methylation is the basis for different epigenetic phenomena such as imprinting,
X chromosome inactivation or the formation of heterochromatin and in general,
DNA methylation of promoter regions inversely correlates with gene expression. DNA
methylation is an alternative to genetic mutation, to silence tumour suppressor
genes in cancer .  CpG islands are found
in about 60% of promoters which have a high CpG density and are usually kept
free of methylation independent of their activity state. However, in cancer
cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene allowing the cell to divide more rapidly. <span>Intragenic
 methylation is found at repetitive
sequences such as satellite repeats and remnants of retroviral insertions such
as LINEs and SINEs in human DNA. </span> CpG methylation of oncogene promoter regions and parasitic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeat_sequences">repeat sequences</a> is often decreased, this hypomethylation in cancer mays lead to deletions, insertions etc in the chromosomes. However, in normal cells, the CpG islands are hypomethylated and the intergenetic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated. </p><span></span><p></p><span></span><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The methylation of the paternal allele at the ICR, and
no methylation for the maternal allele have been observed next to the H19/Igf2
locus in a cell. The CTCF complex binds to the allele on the maternal strand
and the downstream enhancers being active on H19. However, this complex  does not bind to the paternal allele due to
the methyl marks, which leads to silencing of both the H19 gene as the
enhancers instead drive expression of Igf2. Thus, in a normal both H19 from
maternal strand, and Igf2 from paternal strand are observed. However, if this
ICR is hypermethylated, both strands are of paternal origin and this finding
has been associated with Wilm's tumour.</span></p><span>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a mechanism of regulation to target
in treatments due to it <span>may be manipulated, and enduring effects are
ensured as the DNA methyltransferase enzymes preserve methyl marks during
mitosis. However, during critical periods in which epigenetic reprogramming
occurs, these treatments may interfere with normal functioning of the system.
For example,  in pregnant mothers these
treatments should not be prescribed.  </span></p><span>
