    <div class="field-value">When it comes to cancer, abberrant epigenetic control can play a significant role. One of the epigenetic mechanisms that is altered in cancer is DNA methylation: its global level decreases while methylation of CpG islands increase. Normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands serves the purpose of silencing expression of a gene. However, in cancer cells, hypermethylation of CpG islands may occur which usually silence tumor supressor genes. CIMP - cancers where CpG islands of a set of genes are frequently methylated. There are also single sene examples of hypermethylation, e.g., RB, MLH1, BRCA1, and MGMT. DNA methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elemets is essential for genom stability. Loss of methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements bring about genomic instability which may lead to illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes. This hypomethylation occurs to some degree in all tumor types tested and there is progress with tumorigenicity. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Alterations in DNA methylation at imprint control regions, whether hypomethylation or hypermethylation, can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes, or overexpression of growth promoting genes. Common, early event, often seen in pre-neoplastic tissue - e.g., hypermethylation of ICR lgf2 overexpression in Wilm's tumor. Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome is an imprinted disorder - it is there due to the upregulation of Igf2 (oncogene/growth promoting). This is caused when maternal allele behaves like paternal due to epigenetic disruption for loss of imprinting. This epigenetic disruption can be accounted for embryoninc and childhood tumors, but not adult tumors. Example being aforementioned Wilm's tumor (kidney). Paternal allele is the one where Igf2 should be expressed, while promoters of maternal allele are methylated and thus imprinted. However, it may happen that maternal allele gets unmethylated due to imprit disruption or other epigenetic/genetic process which brings about upregulation of maternal Igf2 and leads to Wilm's tumor.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine that is sold as Dacogen is DNA-demethylating agent u<span>sed to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. Decitabine is DNMTi, which means it is hypomethylating agent and it decreases levels of DNA methylation by inhibiting DNA methyl transferase. This drug can be used for such tumors that are driven by tumor supressor hypermethylation. Deplation of DNA methylation can suppress tumorigenesis by clearing methylation from tumors supressor genes and thus activating them.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation during sensitive periods can have signifficant intergenerational epigenetic heritable effects due to its effects on the germ cell. Sensitive periods in epigenetics are the periods during which the epigenetic reprogramming takes place, that is when the process of clearing and re-establishing of epigenetic markers takes place. These periods are when premodial germ cells are being developed and during early embryonic development. Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because epigenetic alterations can be transfered meiotically and mitotically. For example, treating cancer with DNMTi drugs can also cause post-meiotic germ cells to transfer these effects further - so offspring's DNA could also be hypomethylated.</div>
