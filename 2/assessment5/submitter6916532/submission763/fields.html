    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell CpG islands are hypomethylated, but the genome wide is hypermethylated. In cancer cells it is on the contrary. the CpG island contain various tumour supressor genes, wich if methylated are silent, so cancer can occur. The intergenic regions and repetitive elements are commonly hypermethylated, but in cancer are hypomethylated. It is important to mantain genomic stability during replication, if this is hypomethylated there can be mistakes in recombination, deletions or insertions.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The enhancers in H19/Igf2 cluster have a preference to Igf2. In the paternal allele the ICR is methylated and this methylation spreads to H19 unactivating it, so enhancers act increasing expression of Igf2. In the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated and CTCF can bind insulating Igf2, so enhancers act increasing the expression of H19. If you lose imprinting by a mutation or deletion, or an uniparental disomy, only the paternal allele expresses, causing an increase of Igf2, an oncogene</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent. When EZH2 is overactivated by a mutation, histones become hypermethylated, inactivating sereval tumour supressor genes. Using decitabine we can remove this methylation and reactivate the tumour supressor genes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is a mitotically heritable epigenetic mark, meaning that methylation is transmitted to the offspring of the cell, so if it is altered changes may be permanent. The sensitive periods in epigenetic marks are in early development and in the primordial germ cell evelopment. In this periods most of the epigenetic marks are realeased, so treating patients during this periods could cause an error in the cell methylation pattern.</div>
