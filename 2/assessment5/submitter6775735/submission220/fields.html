    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation is to silence gene expression and create genomic stability. In Cancer there is hypermethylation at CpG islands causing a silencing of tumor suppressing genes, also resulting in genomic instability and disruption of tissue specific and imprinting genes. This silencing of tumor suppressing genes contributes to Cancer cell growth.</p><p>The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to maintain genomic integrity, the avoidance of transcriptional interference and it prevents illegitimate recombination.  In Cancer there is a change in the normal DNA methylation makeup; there is abnormal methylation.  There is hypomethylation genome-wide and at inter-genic intervals and repetitive elements; also hypermethylation at some CpG islands where there shouldn't be. These methylation abnormalities and disruptions causes genomic instability and contribute to Cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation of the ICR on the paternal allele causes the CTCF protein not to bind; therefore it doesn't act as an insulator. So enhancers are free to upregulate Igf2 from the paternal allele.  This imprint disorder is called Beckwith Wiedemann Syndrome.   </p><p>Normally, the maternal expression of Cdkn1c restricts cell growth and is a tumor suppressor and the ICR is unmethylated. H19 is produced from the maternal allele. The ICR is bond by a protein CTCF, which is an insulator protein and it insulates the Igf2 (oncogene, growth promoter) from expressing.  </p><p>Imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm's tumor, it appears like you have two paternal alleles and the loss of the maternal allege which is called "uniparental disomy"; therefore you get an upregulation of Igf2, and no expression of Cdkn1c.  This results in not inhibiting the growth of this oncogene.  </p><p>The disruption of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer, because loss of imprinting and heightened expression of growth promoting genes such as Igf2 or disruption of tumor suppressing genes such as Cdkn1c is a hallmark of Cancer.</p><p><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi).  This drug gets into the DNA and binds to the nucleotide and are replication dependent, inhibiting its function; the demethylation is copied in the daughter cell. The DNA methyltranferase can no longer be released. The cancer cells that are dividing much more rapidly are the most affected. Also, it may be because this drug has an affect on the CpG Island hypermethylation. This cell alteration also makes the tumor cells more likely to be affected by conventional chemotherapy. Therefore, this drug slows tumor growth.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Dr.Baylin states that these epigenetic altering drugs which are DNMTi cause epigenetic changes to the cell which are then carried into the proceeding generations of the cell (because they are mitotically heritable), permanently changing it. This lasting impact remains until the methylation is totally erased, and for example tumor suppressing genes are turned back on and are expressed. This has enduring effects on the epigenome.</p><p>A sensitive period is period where epigenetic marks are being removed then reprogrammed. This is a time when environmental changes (due to treatment) can be transgenerationally heritable.</p><p>Sensitive periods are during germ cell development and early embryonic development.</p><p>Treatment during these sensitive periods are inadvisable because there is epigenetic reprogramming being established during these periods, and DNA may be demethlylated and could have a deleterious effect on the genome and can pass on transgenerational changes through the gametes.</p></div>
