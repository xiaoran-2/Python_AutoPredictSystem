    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation function in CpG island is used to
regulate the gene expression, Usually CpG island is kept free of methylation
because of the methylation is inversely correlated with gene expression, but
CpG island in cancer is highly methylated leads to silencing the gene that
regulated by methylated promoter. This target gene usually gene that
responsible for cell cylce regulator (tumor suppresor), DNA repair or apoptosis
that caused genomic instability and deregulation of cell cycle. All this cell
function disruption converge into aberrant cell growth. <br />Besides
regulation of methylation in promoter (CpG island), methylation also occur on
intergenic region and repetitive elements. The function of methylation in this
site is to repress the transcription from cryptic start sites, inhibit movement
of transposon and to prevent recombination between repeated sequences. In the
cancer cell, the methylation status in intergenic region was globally
hypomethylated. This will cause genomic instability since there will be many
transcription from cyptic start site, active movement of transposon and
recombination between repetitive element that leads to cancer conditions. <br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span> </span><span>H19/Igf2 cluster consists of many gene parts.
Basically there is one enhancer that will regulate H19 gene and Igf2 gene
transcription, with H19 closer to enhancer than Igf2. H19 and Igf2 gene is
separated by insulator that regulated by methylation. In paternal allele the
insulator part and the start of h19 gene was methylated so the enhancer does
not acts at this site instead acts in Igf2 sites. This will causes
transcription Igf2 but no h19. On other hand, the inverse status occurs in
maternal allele. Instead of methylated, the insulator part of insulator was
hypomethylated, so the enhancer able to access the gene part that near to it,
that is h19. So, in maternal allele, H19 will be transcribed but none of igf2
transcription detected. Normally, person receive maternal and paternal allele
so only one locus of igf2 will be transcribed (since theres only one insulator
methylation). But in the Wilm tumor patients, two of insulator was methylated
which causes both of igf2 locus transcribed. Since Igf2 stimulate cell growth,
the double dose of this protein will impact on high rate of cell division and
finally the cancer condition will arise. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine belongs to drug demethylating agents
or hypomethylating agents. This drug will significantly decrease the number of
methylated base in genome since this drug able to inhibit action of DNA
methyltransferase. Antitumor effect from this drug was came from facts that the
tumor cells has many of region in the genome hypermethylated (especially on the
CpG island in promoter of tumor supressor gene). This methylation prevented
expression of tumor suppressor gene so the cell division become unregulated
that will converge into cancer. Relieving methylation in the promoter of the
tumor suppressor gene will causes expression of the tumor suppressor  gene so the cell cycle regulation might be can
be restored. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The
treatment which target epigenetic status of the cell will have long lasting
effect because the epigenetic profile was inherited into daughter cell when
cell divide, so they divided cell will have epigenetic character of the
original (‘parents’) cell. Sensitive period is period when the cells doing
epigenetic marks regulation (erase, build new marks). This time is crucial to
define the starting condition of the epigenetic status of the cell. This happen
in early development (blastosis etc). Treating disease which target change of epigenetic
profile cell is not advisable during this stage because that will disrupted the
process of making starting condition of epigenetic marks. If treated in this
condition the cell will have unregulated epigenetic marks (will become hypomethylated)
that result in disruption of normal cell functions. </p></div>
