    <div class="field-value"><p>It is important to understand how DNA methylation is altered
in cancer. Knowing the mechanisms involved will aid in study that may find
improved techniques of diagnosis, more accurate prognoses, and more effective
and less side effect burdened treatments.</p>

<p>CpG islands are found at the promoter site of genes. Normal
CpG islands are generally unmethylated/active. 
The gene can then be transcripted and the protein specific to that gene
can be expressed and normal silencing of certain regions takes place.  Most normal CpG islands are located at tumor
suppressor sites and are generally unmethylated/active.</p>

<p> If the CpG islands are normal and unmethylated/active, the
promoter function can allow the transcription/expression of proteins that inactivate/methylate/silence
the intergenic region and the repetitive elements that promote unchecked cell
growth/tumors.  Thereby fulfilling the
normal tumor suppressing function.</p>

<p> In cancer the normally unmethylated/active CpG islands at
tumor suppressors, are methylated/silenced. This means that the promoter
associated with the CpG island is unable to function and silence/methylate the
intergenic region and the repetitive elements. This promoter inability allows unchecked
cell growth and tumor formation.  Normally,
the CpG islands promoter silences/methylates the intergenic region and
repetitive elements resulting in the blocking of unchecked cell growth and
tumor development.</p>

<p>The intergenic region and repetitive elements are usually
silenced/methylated/inactivated by the unmethylated/active CpG islands plus
promoter. In a cancer, the intergenic region and repetitive elements are expressed
(unmethylated/active) because the abnormally (cancer effected) methylated/inactive/silenced
CpG island and promoter are unable to silence/methylate them.  An unmethylated/active intergenic region and
repetitive elements results in unchecked cell growth or tumor formation, i.e.
cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normal Igf2/H19 cluster in the PATERNAL allele’s imprint
control region (ICR) is methylated blocking H19 expression. The downstream
enhancers then are able to act upstream on the Igf2 gene producing the Igf2
protein. </p>

<p> In the normal MATERNAL allele the Igf2/H19 cluster’s ICR is unmethylated allowing expression of the H19 gene.  CTCF, an insulator protein, binds to the
unmethylated ICR preventing downstream enhancers from acting on Igf2 genes. No
Igf2 is produced. The enhancers then act on H19.  The normal maternal allele produces only H19.</p>

<p> Normal maternal and paternal Igf2/H19 alleles provide
balanced amounts of growth restricting and growth promoting gene expression.</p>

<p> Wilm’s tumor characteristics illustrate how the disruption
of imprinting can lead to cancers. The abnormal maternal H19/Igf2 cluster is
methylated resulting in the inactivation of the H19 gene. Since the ICR is
methylated, the CTCF insulator does not bind; the enhancers then are free to
act on the Igf2 gene.</p>

<p> The Igf2/H19 PATERNAL allele is unaffected and produces the
usual Igf2 product.</p>

<p> The result is a situation where there is a double portion of
Igf2, a growth stimulator. Growth restricting genes are silenced or under
expressed upsetting the balance and increasing cancer development  probability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to a class of anti-cancer drugs called DNA-demethylating
agents/DNA methyltransferase
inhibitors. </p>

<p> The DNA-methyltransferase inhibitors, such as Decitabine,
are nucleoside analogues. They are able to work inside the nucleus during DNA
synthesis.   In cancer, certain genes
become epigenetically methylated/silenced in an abnormal way. Prominently genes
that produce cell growth inhibitors. When the tumor cells divide and the
epigenetic marks are passed on to the daughter cells' DNA methyltransferase
inhibitors bind to the targeted sites and prevent DNMT1 from binding and making
it impossible to pass along the abnormal methylation/silencing epigenetic marks
to the daughter cells.  Once the DNA-methyltransferase binds it can’t be reversed and becomes part of the heritable epigenetic
make-up of the daughter cell.  Subsequent
cell divisions then exhibit the DNA methyltransferase effects (normal expression) and can produce
the anti-tumor suppressing proteins, thus slowing the cancer’s growth.  </p><p><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer suppressing drugs in the DNA methyltransferase class
are nucleoside analogs able to work within the nucleus to block DNMT1 that
facilitates transfer of abnormal epigenetic marks from the mother cell to the
daughter cells. DNA methyltransferase changes the abnormal epigenetic mark from
methylated to unmethylated allowing expression of tumor suppressing proteins.   This change is irreversible and becomes a
permanent part of the cell line.  These
changes can last well beyond, even for a lifetime, the period they might be
paired with chemotherapy or other drug treatment. </p><p>These changes are generally
organism wide and can affect other genes not related to the targeted tumor.
Permanent changes to the epigenetic machinery can result. There are sensitive periods when introducing DNA methyltransferase
type drugs, among others, are then not advisable.  There can be unintended consequences due to yet undiscovered genetic and epigenetic functions and interactions. Serious thought is
necessary when cancer treatments are considered for the following: the very
young, as their bodies are still developing; pre-teen boys whose sperm are
developing and pre-teen girls whose eggs are maturing; pregnant women, because
their fetuses could be in the sensitive periods of early embryonic development
and/or primordial germ cell development during treatment.</p></div>
