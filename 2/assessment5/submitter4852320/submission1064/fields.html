    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><br /><br />unusually high DNA methylated CpG rich sites are found in cancers, furthermore hypermethylation of CpG island shores link to cancer, this is due to hypermethylation of  CpG  promoters of tumor suppressor genes, leading to silence of tumor suppressor genes. this in turn leads to cancer as tumor suppressors such as p53, p16 are affected and may not be transcribed because they are silenced. this leads to tumor invasiveness etc.<br /><br />a way silencing occurs is by Antisense noncoding RNA (ANRIL) targeting PCR complexes to tumor suppressor genes in INK4 locus. ANRIL recruits PCR1 &amp; PCR2 complexes which  form heterochromatin around INK4b ARF INKa locus, the ANRIL mediates the silence of tumor suppressor genes.<br /><br />hypomethylation of satellite repeats occur in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors,  pancreatic and epithelil cncers.<br /><br />this can be seen in the knockout of BRCA1 in murine neural stem cells which was associated with increased transcription of repeat satellite and loss of histone H2A ubiquitylation at pericentometric heterochromatin. this lead to DNA damage and loss of genome stability.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">paternally expressed incRNA AIR is required for silencing of maternally expressed protein coding genes Igf2R/Slc22A2/Slcr22a3 and also inhibits expression by targeting H3K9 histone methyltransferase G9a to the Slc22a3 promoter.<br /><br /><span></span><p>lncRNAs involved in epigenetic silencing and imprinting in maternal allelle, such as the X-inactivation promoting lncRNA XIST, which recruits the Polycomb repressive complex (PRC) to silence the X chromosome from which is transcribed and TSIX, which is transcribed from the opposite strand and regulates XIST levels during X-inactivation </p><p> </p><p></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is an anti-cancer
            ("antineoplastic" or "cytotoxic") chemotherapy drug.  <br /><br /><br />Decitabine is classified            as an "antimetabolite" and a "demethylation" agent, this reverses silencing by methylation of the tumor suppressor genes and improve cancer treatment.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation of DNA is a major mechanism that regulates gene expression            in cells.  When there is an increase in DNA methylation this can result in            the blockage of the activity of "suppressor genes" that regulate cell division and            growth.  When suppressor genes are blocked, cell division becomes unregulated,            allowing or promoting cancer.</p><p>sensitive periods occur in patient with developing germ cells, children  need proper environmental stimuli to develop certain abilities.  For 
example, babies have the ability to grow in length and weight</p><p>use of tumor drugs at sensitive periods could lead to inhibition of the epigenetic machinery.</p></div>
