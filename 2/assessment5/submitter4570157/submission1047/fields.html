    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><ul><li><b>Describe the normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.</b></li></ul>Normally DNA methylation occurs at CpG Island in promoetr region to silence a gene while in intergenic region and repetitive element region, it serve to maintain genomic integrity and stability.<br /><ul><li><b>Describe how DNA methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.</b></li></ul><p>DNA methylation decreased through demethylation under the
control of demethylase enzyme which remove methyl group from cytocine or slow
down methylation during replication of cells. e.g, TET proteins </p>

<p><b>Explain how
disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.</b></p>

<p>Disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands causes over
expression of genes as well as increased genomic instability and integrity
which result into cancer.</p>

<p><b>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.</b></p>

<p>DNA methylation in intergenic region and repetitive element
region serve to maintain genomic integrity and stability by reducing  deletion, insertion, transposition,
translocation of these elements.</p>

<p><b>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in
cancer.</b></p>

<p>In cancer these area are either demethylated or
hypermethylated.</p>

<p><b>Explain how
disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements
contributes to cancer.</b></p>

<p>When intergenic regions and repetitive elements become
unstable and loss their integrity. They translocate where they should not and
disrupt the normal function of cell and causes over growth of cells and hence
results into cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><b>Describe the methylation pattern
of the paternal allele and how this determines Igf2 expression status.  </b></p>

<p>Few
genes are expressed from maternal as well paternal origin, other wise they are
either maternal or paternal imprinted. When paternal allele is methylated, it
is imprinted and its counterpart maternal allele express itself. It H19 bound
with CTFC protein which is insulator protein but as this protein is not present
in paternal allele so it is free to act on Igf2 and express it.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><b><span>Describe the methylation pattern
of the maternal allele and how this determines Igf2 expression status.  </span></b></p>

<p>Maternal
cells are unmethylated so H19 is expressed and bind with CTFC protein which is
insulated protein and control expression of Igf2.</p>

<p><b><span>Describe how imprinting at the
H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour. 
</span></b></p>

<p>There
is over expression of Igf2 in the syndrome which result in overgrowth of cells
which turn into cancer</p>

<p><b>Explain how disrupting imprinting
at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.</b></p>

<p><span>Igf2
promote the growth of cells and cells loss their control and it results into
cancer </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><b>Identify the class of
epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.  </b></p>

<p>It belongs to a group of drugs called DNA methyltransferase inhibitors</p>

<p>•             <b>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA
methylation. </b></p>

<p>It inhibits DNA Methylation by inhibiting the function of
DNMT3A and DNMT3B which transfer methyl to cytocine and they are nucleoside
analoges </p>

<p>•             <b>Describe how Decitabine can have an
anti-tumour effect.  </b></p>

<p>As it inhibits DNA methylation on all replicating cells and
cancer cells are more in numbers so they affect more severy and become unstable
and dies </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring
effects on the epigenome. </p>

<p> DNA methylation increase integrity and stability of enzyme and passit from generation to generation</p>

<p>Define what is meant by a sensitive period. </p>

<p>IWhen epigentic marks removed during development.</p><p>Identify sensitive periods of development. </p><p>Germ cell division</p>

<p>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would
be inadvisable.</p><p>Because cell are undiffrentiated and it may cause and delterious affects    </p></div>
