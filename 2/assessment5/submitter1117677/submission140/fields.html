    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are normally kept free of methylation (and since they are found in about 60% of promoters, this is helpful for normal genome functioning, since DNA methylation is associated with gene silencing), but in cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated; this causes silencing of the gene, which can lead to cancer in one of two main ways: specifically silencing a tumor-suppressor gene removes that gene's ability to keep cell growth/regulation in check, and generally genome-wide silencing leads to disregulation in cell growth/regulation. <br /><br />In comparison to CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated and thus not actively transcribed, which is important for genomic stability; in cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are often hypomethylated and thus transcribed more than they should be for normal functioning. In cancer, hypomethylation of these regions/elements leads to genomic instability and improperly regulated growth.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the <b>maternal </b>allele of a normal cell, the imprint-control region (ICR) of the H19 gene is <i>not </i>methylated, allowing CTCF (a trancription factor) to bind to the ICR so that H19 is expressed; consequently, Igf2 is <i>not </i>expressed by the maternal allele. In contrast, in the <b>paternal </b>allele of a normal cell, the ICR of the H19 gene is methylated; CTCF cannot bind to the ICR, and so Igf2 is expressed by the paternal allele.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumor, the ICR is hypermethylated in both the maternal and paternal alleles, leading to an overexpression of Igf2 and an underexpression of H19. <span>A loss of </span>H19<span> gene activity, which normally restrains growth, and an increase in </span>IGF2<span> gene activity, which promotes growth, together lead to overgrowth and an increased risk of cancerous tumors.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent and works by inhibiting the activity of the enzyme EZH2, which attaches methyl groups to histones. When EZH2 is overactive, it </span><span>methylates histones more than they should be and thus silences the genes they surround, including tumour-suppressor genes whose job is to stop the uncontrolled cell growth that causes cancer. So if Decitabine can inhibit EZH2, histones should remain properly methylated and uncontrolled cell growth can be avoided.</span><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, however, they do not return. A "sensitive period" here refers to two specific periods of normal development in which epigentic marks are erased and reset: the pre-implantation period of an embryo (i.e., its period of early development) and primordial germ cell development. Treatment during these sensitive periods would likely be harmful by interfering with normal epigenetic regulatory mechanisms, and it could also simply be ineffective because of epigenetic resetting.</span></div>
