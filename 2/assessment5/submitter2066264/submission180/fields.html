    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In cancer, the CpG islands are hypermethylated, while the intergenic areas, repeats and introns are hypomethylated.<br />Normal function of DNA methylation is the formation of repressive chromatin structure, disallowing access to transcription factors, hence silencing the gene.<br />CpG islands are generally found in the promoter of tumour suppressor genes.  When CpG islands are hypermethylated in a cancer, it silence the tumour suppressor genes.  When these genes are silenced, they would not be able to stop the uncontrolled cell growth of cancer.<br />Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated to maintain genomic stability.  When they are hypomethylated, various abnormalities like illegitimate recombinations, deletions, insertions, reciprocal translocations occurs.  When it does, it disrupts normal gene function, creating genomic instability. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent.  By demethylating CpG islands, which is usually in the promoter regions of tumour suppressor genes, it promotes the expression of tumour suppressor genes.<br /><br />Because tumour suppressor genes are activated, they are able to control cell growth, hence have an anti-tumour effect.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, hence altering DNA methylation can be maintained through cell growth, and would have effects that last beyond the treatment period.<br />Sensitive period is the periods where epigenetic reprogramming, its erasure and resetting, is taking place.  The main sensitive periods are during early development and premordial germ cell development, and sometimes during cell differentiation.<br />Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable as it may disrupt epigenetic reprogramming.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">At H19/lgf2 cluster, the paternal allele is methylated at its imprint control centre.  In this state, enhancers act on lgf2 (a growth-promoter), promoting its expression from the paternal allele.  <br />The maternal allele is unmethylated at its imprint control centre.  In this state, the allele is bound by a protein, and it insulates lgf2 from enhancers.  The enhancer then act on H19, promoting its expression.<br />Disruption of imprinting at this cluster caused the loss of a tumour suppressor, and the upregulation of a oncogene, hence uncontrolled growth which results in a cancer.<br /></div>
