    <div class="field-value"><p>    At
CpG islands, according to Hassler and Egger (2012) normal
function of DNA methylation is associated
with imprinting, X chromosome
inactivation, and in the formation of heterochromatin.
In normal cells, CpG islands that are found in most of promoters have a high
CpG content, but are usually free of methylation. Nevertheless, in cancer
cells, promoter CpG islands can become hypermethylated causing silencing of the
underlying gene (Hassler and Egger, 2012). Therefore, it
can silence tumour suppressor genes, contributing with cancer establishment. Moreover, cancer epigenome is characterized by a set of others genes that have abnormal gains of DNA methylation and also simultaneous global losses in DNA methylation at others regions.</p><p>    At intergenic regions and repetitive
elements of a normal cell, DNA methylation is associated with maintenance of
genome integrity, with silencing
to
prevent transposition, preventing insertions such as LINEs and SINEs, preventing
transcriptional interference from strong promoters, and prevent illegitimate
recombination (Hassler and Egger, 2012). In cancer, loss of DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements leads
to genomic instability,
thus can occurs activation of repeats, transposition or activation of cryptic
promoters with disruption to neighbouring genes. </p><p></p><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>

    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>    Decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) is a
chemical analogue of cytidine (pyrimidine nucleosides and
analogues) of class Carbohydrate Conjugates, subclass Glycosyl
Compounds (Pyrimidine Nucleosides and Analogues) (Source: Drug Bank). Cells incorporate Decitabine into DNA during replication and the incorporation of this inhibits
methyltransferase, thus causing demethylation in that sequence and reducing the
impact of the hypermethylation at promoter CpG islands sites. <br /></p><p>    Due to the fact that Decitabine inhibits methyltransferase, it can be used for controlling
hypermethylation at
promoter's CpG islands of the underlying tumour suppressor gene, therefore
 reactivating
epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor genes (Stresemann and Lyko, 
2008). Decitabine can exert its antineoplastic effect on neoplastic 
cells
from myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), reversing epigenetic mutations at
promoter's CpG islands <span>of the silenced tumor suppressor genes, it have been shown increased re-expression of genes such as CDKN2B/p15INK4B (Santos <i>et al</i>., 2010), restoring proliferation
control and apoptosis sensitivity </span>in
patients with MDS.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>    Reprogramming of
DNA methylation takes place on fertilization in the zygote and in primordial
germ cells (PGCs), thus use of inhibitors
such
as Decitabine can modify
reprogramming
of DNA methylation, and effects of use
of methylation inhibitors on germ cells should be avoided. In this<span> period, the standard
functionality of the cell is defined by the set of genes that </span><span>must </span>be <span>active and
those that must be silenced, thus
the use of inhibitors of </span>methyltransferase<span> <span>at this time is </span></span>inadvisable.
Additionally, since<span> DNA methylation is mitotically heritable,
changing the pattern of DNA methylation due to the </span>enduring effects of Decitabine <span>can deregulate
one set of genes that
should be methylated and also change other normally
methylated regions </span>and
cause disruption of <span>metabolic
pathways. Moreover, the interplay between methylation of DNA/Histone,
Histone acetylation and activity of Noncoding RNAs show a crucial role for
keeping homeostasis and nuclear architecture, so should be kept
so long term. </span></p>
