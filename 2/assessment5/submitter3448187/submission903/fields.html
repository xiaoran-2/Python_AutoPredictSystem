    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, the methylation of CpG islands plays an important role in gene expression and usually they are hypomethylated, enabling inducing promoters of genes they regulate. The cancer cells, these island CpG are hypermethylated (at a high rate), resulting loss of imprinted, a missregulation of promoters that controls, such as tumor suppressor genes, in the regulation of key processes involving cycle control cell and thus contributing to the uncontrolled proliferation of a tumor cell.</p>
<p>In normal cells  CpG pair are hypermethylated. These methylations remain silenced repetitive elements, introns, transpones … But genome-wideDNA hypomethylation is observed in  tumor cells (20-60%), a fact that may cause genomic instability by miss repression of mobile elements and genes oncogenes type can be active.</p>
<p>Overall, CpG islands hypermethylation and overall hypomethylation of DNA in cancer cells results in a deregulation of the cell cycle because of the higher gene expression of tumors have lost because oncogenes are over expressed, because there is a loss of imprinting, because moving parts are activated can cause damage DNA mutations and thus, errors in repair and lead to genomic instability. All these events have been found in tumor cells at a high ratio.</p><div><span><br /></span></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, the H19 gene is expressed in the maternal allele and igf2 in the paternal allele. H19 gene  produces a long non coding RNA antisense chain that regulates expression of igf2 gene. This combination allows the cells have normal cell growth. </p>
<p>Wilms tumor has loss of imprinting igf2/H19 pair, wherein the promoter of the maternal H19 allele is methylated, like the paternal chromosome and is not expressed in any of the copies. This lost of imprinting  silences H19 and produces overexpression of IGF2 and this is a cause of excessive growth cell.</p><div><span><br /></span></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A clinical study conduced with a mixture of inhibitors where is observed a slowdown in the growth of tumors. Some participants in the study did not respond to treatment with epigenetic drugs, their tumors were not discounted, however the effects are heritable and trransmited to daughter cells in successive divisions during cell division until the target brands actively erased. Once deleted does not reappear. It could then happen that would slow the growth of the system have to kill cancer cells.</p>
<p><span>Sensitive periods in development are those in which key epigenetic events important for proper subsequent operation because these are heritable changes occur. For example are the periods of formation of oocitos, and puberty in males or during fetal development. Because this is not advisable treatments with epigenetic drugs because would be altered normal patterns in the epigenetic process.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"> DNA-demethylating agents, in the form of decitabine, sold as Dacogen by Eisai, a Japanese company, are used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukemia. Is an inhibitor of methyltransferase (DNMT1), is an analogue of cytosine, and is incorporated into the DNA. There is covalently bound to DNMT1 and blocking its action. As anticancer drug acts as a hypomethylating agent since in tumor cells has been hypermethylation. </div>
