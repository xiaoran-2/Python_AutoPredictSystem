    <div class="field-value">Q1. Overall, well written answer. Answered all the sub-questions, but I had some issues with the following details:
1. "But genome-wideDNA hypomethylation is observed in  tumor cells (20-60%)":  I am not sure where you got that percentage for DNA hypomethylation in tumor cells but I have given the benefit of doubt. 
 Q2. Regarding methylation in both paternal and maternal allele you did mention the methylation and unmethylation of H19 (promoters) and the effect of silencing of H19 on the expression of Igf2 (Leighton PA et al.,  PMID 7536897), which was brilliant since H19 function was not covered in course exclusively, but you forgot to mention the methylation state of ICR and its contribution to Wilm’s tumor. I'm not sure if Wilm's tumor has been observed by knock out on H19 gene, but I'll be surprised if it doesn't. So I have given you the benefit of doubt on the deactivation of H19 contributing to Wilm's tumor.
Q3. All the sub-questions were answered correctly except for "how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect". Your answer was: "As anticancer drug acts as a hypomethylating agent since in tumor cells has been hypermethylation." This is vaguely answered because we want hypomethylation of tumor suppressor genes or those that contribute to tumor suppressing pathways. Secondly, not necessarily a tumor could arise only by hypermethylation of target genes, it can be a result of the combination of both hypomethylation of some genes and hypermethylation of other target genes.
Q4. 
1 .The definition of sensitive period you gave: “key epigenetic events important for proper subsequent operation because these are heritable changes occur” is not exact. Surely, its a period of key epigenetic events but they those changes are mitotically heritable as meiotic heritability of all epigenetic marks is still under further investigation. Further, if you could describe what are those key epigenetic events are I would have awarded you full points. Those key epigenetic events are the epigenetic reprogramming i.e removal and then laying down of epigenetic marks.
2.  “periods of formation of oocitos, and puberty in males or during fetal development” as sensitive periods is not clear. I assume you meant development of oocytes instead of “formation of oocitos”. Overall correction on your answer is “PGC development: period of development of oocytes from primordial germ cells (in females), period of development of male gametes from their primordial germ cells and Early Embryonic development”.</div>
