    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value">In many genes in mammalian genomes, CpG islands are associated with the start of a gene which is called promoter. For most instances, CpG islands are unmethylated to allow gene expression, such as the tumour suppressor genes.<br />In cancer cells, DNA methylation occurs at CpG islands, this will make CpG islands experience hypermethylation. Consequently, tumour suppressor genes are silenced and could not function normally, leading to unregulated cell division or cell growth, thus contributing to cancer.<br /><br />For intergenic regions and repetitive elements of a gene, normally they are methylated to allow normal function of gene. In cancer cells, they are hypomethylated or unmethylated, this leads to genomic instability which will result in illegitimate recombination of repeats, activation of repeats/ transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes. This genomic instability will enhance tumorigenesis, thus contributing to occurrence of cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">For the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster, in the normal function of imprinting:<br /><br />On the paternal allele, the imprint control region (ICR) is methylated, so the CTCF insulator protein cannot bind on ICR and cannot insulate lgf2. Without CTCF, DNA methylation spread to nearby H19 promoter and silenced it, allowing the downstream enhancers to act on the Igf2 gene and Igf2 is expressed. <br /><br />While on the maternal allele, the imprint control region (ICR) is unmethylated and CTCF can bind on ICR and insulate the lgf2, this allows enhancers to act on the H19, thus H19 is expressed and Igf2 is silenced.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumour, both paternal and maternal allele's imprint control regions are methylated. Hypermethylation of both ICRs allows lgf2 to express on both alleles. Because lgf2 is a growth promoting gene, so overexpression and double dosage of lgf2 will lead to tumourigenesis, thus contributing to cancer.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>
            Decitabine belongs to a class of drugs known as DNA methytransferase inhibitors (DNMT inhibitors), which is a DNA "demethylating" agent.<br /></p><p>Decitabine inhibit or interfer DNA methylation in cancer cells and this allows tumour suppressor gene to function normally, thus reducing unregulated cell division or cell growth and restore control over cell growth. Decitabine works by binding DNA methytransferase when cells are replicating, because Decitabine is division dependent, so it works most effectively when cells are replicating. Since cancer cells which divide much more rapidly than other cells, they are more severely affected. This demonstrates that Decitabine has anti-tumour effect.<br /></p>
        <p>
            
        </p>
        <p>
            Decitabine also belongs to the category of drug called antimetabolites. When they are incorporated into the cellular metabolism, they interact
            with a number of targets within the cells to produce a direct cytotoxic effect that
            causes death of rapidly dividing cancer cells.

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is the basis for epigenetic phenomena such as imprinting and  X 
chromosome inactivation. Altering DNA methylation could have detrimental effects on the epigenome. It may lead to epigenomic instability and causes of many epigenetic diseases and cancer such as Beckwith Weidemann syndrome and Wilm's tumour.<br /><br />Altering DNA methylation is most sensitive during sensitive periods of development, in which during these periods, reprogramming and resetting of epigenetic marks occur. These epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable and can be passed down to the offspring. Sensitive periods of development are the periods of pre-implantation development and germ cell development.<br /><br />Since epigenetic marks involved DNA methylation which is also mitotically heritable, it is inadvisable to treat patients during sensitive periods, for  example expecting mothers, pregnant mothers and puberty stage young patients. Because a lot of epigenetic reprogramming happens in early embryonic development as well as during primordial germ cell development, altering DNA methylation before or during pregnancy may disrupt these processes and have impact upon epigenome and may affect future generations. As for young patients at puberty stage, it may have negative impact on their gametogenesis and germ cell maturation process.<br /><br /></div>
