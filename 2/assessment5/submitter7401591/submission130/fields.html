    <div class="field-value">In normal cells, CPG islands are
unmethylated.  CPG islands contain tumour suppressors, such as apoptosis promoters, DNA repair genes and transcription factors, which need to be available to protect the stability of the genome.  In cancer, the CPG islands become hypermethylated,
making these tumour suppressors unavailable, and providing one of the conditions that
allows for tumour growth.  
An example of this is the RB gene, which is frequently found to be methylated in the promoter region in retinoblastoma.<br /><br />In normal cells, the repetitive
elements are methylated so that the chromatin in these regions will be
compressed.  In cancer, these repetitive
elements become hypomethylated, making the chromatin in these regions more
available.  This can lead to
translocations between chromosomes, caused by incorrect pairings with repetitive
elements on other chromosomes – part of the genomic instability which is a
hallmark of cancer. Intergenic regions, likewise, are methylated in healthy
cells, but become hypomethylated in cancer. 
These regions may contain enhancers or promoters of other genes, and
changing their methylation status can cause growth factors to be overexpressed,
or tumour suppressing genes to be underexpressed.<br /><br />While hypo- and hyper-methylation affect individual cancer patients to different degrees, and many changes in methylation are harmless, the evidence currently suggests that these epigenetic changes to DNA methylation are actually more frequent in cancers than genetic mutations.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the H19/Igf2 cluster on chromosome
11, the paternal and maternal alleles have different methylation patterns, to
ensure the correct dosage of Igf2 expression.<span><br /><br />On the maternal allele, the imprint
control region (ICR) is unmethylated.  This
ICF binds to an insulator protein, CTCF, which acts to insulate Igf2 from the
enhancers downstream of the locus.  These
enhancers instead promote expression of H19. </span>

<p><span>On the paternal allele, the ICR is
methylated, preventing binding by CTCF, and leaving Igf2 uninsulated.  The methylation also affects the H19 locus,
and allows the enhancers to skip over this locus and instead promote the
(uninsulated) Igf2.</span></p>

<p>Thus, Igf2 is expressed solely from the
paternal allele, and H19 solely from the maternal one.</p>

<p><span>In Wilm’s
tumour, imprinting at this locus is disrupted so that the ICR on both alleles is methylated - effectively resulting in two paternal chromosomes.  This provides a double dose of Igf2,
a growth factor which becomes an oncogene when over-expressed.  In addition to the overexpression of Igf2, methylation of this locus also leads to loss of H19,
which produces a non-coding RNA thought to act as a tumor suppressor.</span> The combination of enhanced and unrestricted growth is one of the hallmarks of cancer.<br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabene (deoxyazacytidine)
is a DNA-demethylating agent, used to treat acute myelogenous leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. It is classed as a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor.

<p>Decitabene
takes advantage of the fact that, unlike genetic changes, epigenetic
modifications can be reversed, and that lower doses can be used, because it
isn’t necessary to kill cells, just re-program them.  Interestingly, Decitabene does not appear to
demethylate normal cells.  This might be
because cancerous cells divide more frequently than normal cells and are
thus more sensitive to epigenetic changes; alternatively, cancer cells may require hypermethylation to proliferate, and so
a relatively weak demethylating effect (that does not affect
normal cells) can dramatically affect cancer cells. 

</p><p>Decitabene's anti-tumour effect is created by re-instating the
body’s innate protections against cancer. 
Once normal methylation is re-established, cells are able to produce the
pro-apoptotic or DNA repair proteins required to either destroy cancerous cells
or restore their  normal function.<br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">An advantage of treatments aimed at changing the disordered epigenetic
state of cancer cells is that these changes are inherited by daughter
cells.  Thus, even after treatment has ceased, treated cells produce
daughter cells with the same methylation status as their parent cells (in fact,
this is the same mechanism whereby cancerous cells pass on their disordered
epigenetic states rather than producing healthy daughter cells).

<p>Epigenetic drugs affect the epigenetic state not just
of cancer cells, but of all cells.  While the effects on normal cells have
been found to be relatively mild, there are ‘sensitive periods’ during which it
would be less advisable to treat people with epigenetic drugs.  </p>

<p><span>The first set of sensitive periods are during those
times when epigenetic reprogramming is taking place – just after fertilisation,
and then again during primordial germ cell development.  This effectively means during the early
pregnancy of the mother.</span></p>

<p>A second set of sensitive periods during which
epigenetic drugs should be used with caution might be during childhood or
during the rest of pregnancy.  During both these periods, cells are
dividing more rapidly than usual, and heritable changes to their epigenetics
will thus be amplified.</p></div>
