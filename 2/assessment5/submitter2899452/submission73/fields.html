    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is one of the epigenetic mechanisms
that is important in regulation of cell type specific gene expression.</p>

<p>CpG islands, frequently found near promoters of genes
that are responsible for essential cell functions or other genes expressed in
the cell, are not methylated. In silenced cellular genes, CG sequences are methylated causing gene suppression.<br /></p><p>Cancer cells have differing patterns of methylation.
 CPG islands have a greater tendency to be hypermethylated rather than
being unmethylated.  CpG island hypermethylation may be useful in
diagnosis, prognosis, and  tumor burden. Differing patterns of
hypermethylation may also serve as predictive markers of chemotherapy response.</p>

<p>In contrast to hypermethylation more likely found in
CpG islands in cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be
hypomethylated in malignant cells rather than being methylated as in normal
cells. Methylation of intergenic regions and at repetitive elements is
important in maintaining genomic integrity in normal cells. Their hypomethylation could aid in
development of malignancy and may be important in cancer  progression.</p>

<p><span>In summary, in cancer cells promoter CpG islands have
a tendency to be hypermethylated leading to silencing of the associated genes. 
This hypermethylation of CpG islands causes silencing of tumor suppressor genes
(such as cell cycle controlling genes, DNA repair genes or genes associated
with apoptosis (programmed<b> </b>cell death)  and thus may contribute to
the development of cancer.  Aberrant epigenetic control in cancer cells
including hyperemethylation of CpG islands and hypomethylation of intergenic
regions and repetitive elements may contribute to the evasion of growth
suppression, genomic instability and to sustaining of proliferative signaling
which leads to growth of abnormal cells that become increasingly abnormal over
time leading to cancer spread  (metastasis).  The role of
hypomethylation seen in intergenic regions and repetitive elements, in malignancy, is less
clear but may contribute to tumorigenesis and tumor progression.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>An instance of cancer
development resulting from loss of imprinting is often found in Wilms' tumor. The
H19 Differentiually Methylated Region (DMR) also called the Imprint Control
Region (ICR) controls the genomic imprinting of both H19 and Igf2.  </p><p>

</p><p> Under normal circumstances, the maternally imprinted Igf2 allele is
expressed only from the paternal Igf2 gene whereas the H19 gene with a
methylated promoter is not expressed.  The maternal allele when paternally
imprinted, in contrast, has an unmethylated promoter and thus an active H19 and
has an inactive Igf2 gene. Silencing of the maternal Igf2 requires the maternal
allele of H19 be unmethylated, allowing CTCF (a transcriptional inhibitor) to
bind to the DMR of the maternal allele thus protecting Igf2 from enhancers downstream.</p>

<p>Wilms' tumors frequently exibit loss of imprinting of the Igf2 gene
resulting in the maternal chromosome adopting the paternal pattern such that there
is methylation of the H19 promotor and the H19 gene is thus off and the
Igf2 gene is turned on. The result of this is increased cell growth leading to
tumor development. Loss of imprinting of Igf2 in Wilms' tumors requires
aberrant methylation of the (DMR) upstream of the imprinted H19 gene responsible
for Igf2 imprinting.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>While decitabine may be
classified as a chemotherapeutic agent, an anti-metabolite, which when
incorporated into DNA can interact with cellular targets resulting in
cytotoxicity which is nonspecific (affecting all rapidly dividing cells),
<b>of more interest is</b> <b>its other mechanism, that of demethylation, an epigenetic
mechanism. </b></p>

<p> Methylation  is significant in cells since it is a major
mechanism of regulation of gene expression that can result in silencing of genes. Silencing of suppressor
genes by methylation can lead to
dysregulation of cell division allowing abnormal growth that can lead to cancer.</p>

<p>Decitabine is a member of
a new class of epigenetic agents referred to as demethylating or
hypomethylating agents.  Decitabine can
alter the silencing of suppressor genes
that regulate important activities such as regulation of growth and
cell division. By demethylation, normal function of genes including tumor
suppressor genes can be restored thus restoring control of cell growth and thus controlling cancer. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>During embryonic
development, demethylation occurs after fertilization and remethylation occurs near the time of implantation.  Remethylation is initiated
by the blastocyst stage by de novo methyltransferases DNMT3A and 3B. The patterns
established are retained during later development as, during mitosis, the
newly synthesized strand is methylated by DNMT1. During development DNA
methylation is essential in establishing cell type specificity that is maintained through rounds of mitosis, maintaining
the epigenome for the life of the organism. In addition to erasure and
resetting of embryonic stem cells, reprogramming also occurs during germ cell
development, both sensitive periods i.e. times when error can occur.</p>

<p>Epigenetic drugs can
alter the methylation state.  Reduction
of DNMT1 levels following treatment can lead to the
failure of full methylatation and as the cells go through rounds of
division, methylation of CpG pairs will become less methylated and the promotor
regions will be more accessible to transcription factors. <br /></p>

<p>If patient
were to be treated with epigenetic drugs during sensitive periods, during
embryonic and germ cell development, it would result in
widespread errors of epigenetic programming that would be lethal to a
developing embryo. Individuals of child bearing potential should use birth
control to avoid exposure during sensitive periods.</p>
