    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation silences gene expression and occurs almost exclusively at the promoters of genes, where CpG nucleotides occur.  Most CpG islands are unmethylated, but a small subset are methylated.</p><p></p><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to maintain genomic stability. In cancer there is hypermethlyation of the tumor suppressor genes, with genome-wide hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements.  Hypomethylation results in open chromatin , making it possible for repetitive elements to reactivate and those which are similar genetically to recombine.  This recombination can result in inappropriate activation of neighboring genes and inferfere with the coding of other genes.  </p><p>

</p><p> In intergenic regions and
repetitive elements, DNA methylation maintains genomic stability by silencing
repeats and preventing gain or loss of chromosomes, and/or illegitimate
combinations of chromosomes.  Unlike CpG islands at the promoters of
genes, intergenic intervals and repetitive elements in the genome are usually
methylated.  This maintains genomic integrity by silencing cryptic
transcription start sites in repeats or cryptic splice sites in the intergenic
intervals.  This also avoids transcriptional interference from strong
promoters within the repeats.  In fact, the Genome Defense model states
that the primary function of DNA methylation is to protect the genome from
transposable elements.</p><p>

</p><p> All cancers have aberrant
DNA methylation.  In cancer, changes in DNA methylation lead to
hypermethylation (silencing) of tumor supressor genes and genome-wide
hypomethylation. Since the majority of the genome consists of intergenic and
repetitive elements which are normally methylated, the result of this loss of
methylation is genomic instability as detailed above.  Tumor
suppressor genes become hypermethylated, and therefore inactive, and genes that
promote growth become unmethylated, therefore constantly active.  Genes
that repair DNA and initiate cell death become hypermethylated and inactive.  </p><p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting is the monoallelic
expression of a gene based on the parent-of-origin of the allele. 
Imprinted genes occur in clusters, and their expression is controlled by the
Imprint Control Region (ICR).</p>

<p>In the H19/Ig2 cluster, the ICR
is methylated on the PATERNAL allele, and this methylation spreads downstream
to silence the lncRNA H19.  Enhancers downstream bypass H19 and act on
IgF2 and cause it to express.  IgF2 is an oncogene - a growth promoter.</p>

<p>On the MATERNAL allele in the
same cluster, the ICR is UN-methylated and shielded by the insulator protein
CTCF.  H19 is also UN-methylated, and the upstream enhancers cannot access IgF2, and act on H19
causing it to express. The maternal allele expresses cluster Cdkn1c, which is a growth suppressor.</p>

<p>The maternal and paternal alleles
are imprinted in this way to avoid either uncontrolled growth or no
growth.  If the maternal allele is silenced by inappropriate imprinting, or uniparental disomy results in 2 copies of the parental allele with the growth-promoting cluster, growth is not restricted and cancer results.  Beckwith-Wideman Symdrome is an example of a case in which the maternal allele is lost, and there is up-regulation of IgF2, with uncontrolled growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA
de-methylating agent which acts as a DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitor.  It
is approved for myelopoastic syndrome which has progressed to AML. </p>

<p><span>Decitabine acts as a nucleoside
analog, incorporating itself into DNA upon replication.   
Normally in DNA replication, DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) copies
methylation to the daughter strand, and is then released.  When Decitibine
is present, DNMT is bound irreversibly, and cannot be released. 
Therefore, less available DNMT dials down the process of methylation. 
This process is division-dependent, and cancer cells, which replicate more
quickly than normal cells, are more vulnerable to the effect.  The effect
of deleting DNMT1 is context dependent, and can either enhance or inhibit
tumorigenesis.  If the tumor is the result of tumor-suppressor
hypermethylation, the tumor will be suppressed.  If chromosomal
instability is causing the tumor, less DNA methylation will cause the tumor to
grow.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p></p><p>

</p><p><span>DNA methylation is mitotically
heritable.  Somatic cells make their choice of DNA methylation as
individuals, and the choice is normally maintained throughout the life of the
organism.  That’s why a liver cell doesn’t change into a skin cell. 
Dr. Baylin states: “…epigenetic changes [such as DNA methylation] are passed on
during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are
actively erased.  Once erased, though, they do not return.”  So if epigenetic changes that brought about the cancer can be erased, the tumor might stop growing even it all of its cells were not destroyed.</span></p><p>

</p><p><span> A sensitive period would be
any period of cell reprogramming e.g.:   after fertilization and
during formation of the gametes,  until the age of 8 or 9 years in
humans.  Interfering with DNA methylation at these times could result in
loss of imprinting and interfere with X inactivation in females, or produce
mutations in somatic cells. </span></p><p>
