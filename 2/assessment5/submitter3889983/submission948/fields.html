    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is generally associated with suppression of gene expression.  This holds true for intergenic regions and repetitive elements, where it is necessary to suppress possible transcription products or block movement of the transposable elements, but does not necessarily have the same effect at CpG islands.  These regions are generally found in association with promoter regions and are usually kept unmethylated.  In cancer we see disruption of the usual methylation patterns in CpG islands, intergenic regions, and repetitive elements.  CpG islands are hypermethylated, which generally suppresses gene expression from these promoters, while the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated, leaving these regions more unstable.  CpG hypermethylation of promoters associated with tumor suppressor genes will lead to a suppression of these gene products, one of the hits necessary for a cell to become cancerous.  Creating instability in the genome of the cell represents another hit in the pathway toward cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer by altering methylation patterns and affecting normal gene expression and/or suppression.  An example of this is seen in the H19/Igf2 cluster.  The normal methylation pattern has H19 methylated in the paternal allele, allowing for expression of Igf2, and the same region unmethylated in the maternal allele, with no expression of Igf2.  Wilm's tumor disrupts this imprinting by allowing the maternal allele to become methylated, like the paternal allele, leading to an excess of Igf2 expression.  This overexpression is associated with the overexpression of growth-promoting genes, which then stimulate growth in cells where this extra stimulation is not needed.  This additional growth stimulation is one of the pieces necessary for the development of cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, which acts to remove methyl groups from DNA molecules.  Decitabine will decrease the amount of DNA methylation in any cell exposed to it, which makes it particularly useful in the treatment of cancer.  Many cancer cells show an increase in methylation, especially in CpG islands in and around promoter regions, leading to suppression of gene expression from these promoters.  Removal of these methyl groups can allow for the reactivation of tumor-suppression genes, which would act against the formation or growth of tumor cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment because DNA methylation patterns are heritable, meaning that they are passed on with each mitotic division.  Changing these methylation patterns in a cell is not a one-time effect; the new methylation patterns will be passed on to the progeny of the cells containing these new patterns.  There are periods in the development of an organism where DNA methylation is stripped so that new marks can be laid down; these are referred to as sensitive periods and occur early in embryogenesis and when the primordial germ cells are formed.  Although the use of drugs that alter DNA methylation patterns may be an effective means of treating cancer, care must be taken so that these drugs are not administered during these sensitive periods so that the laying down of imprinting or other epigenetic marks can occur where they need to occur.</div>
