    <div class="field-value"><em>CpG islands</em> are an accumulation of CpGs within the promoters of genes. When they are methylated it leads to <em>silencing </em>of the corresponding gene. Typically, CpG islands are not methylated in the whole genome, with a few exceptions. <a title="Link: https://class.coursera.org/epigenetics-002/lecture/13" href="https://class.coursera.org/epigenetics-002/lecture/13">[1]</a><br />In the case of cancer, this is typically different: CpG islands within promoters are often <em>hypermethylated</em>. This leads to silencing of the corresponding genes. Such silencing often contributes to the growth of cancer, since many of the affected genes are<em> tumor suppressor genes</em>. When they are silenced, this is enabling the cancer to grow. <a title="Link: https://class.coursera.org/epigenetics-002/lecture/97" href="https://class.coursera.org/epigenetics-002/lecture/97">[2]</a><br />Since CpG island hypermethylation is mitotically heritable, this state stays stable within the whole tumour tissue. <a title="Link: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3480634/" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3480634/">[5]</a><br /><br />In contrast to CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are typically <em>methylated</em>. The function of this methylation is to increase the<strong> </strong><em>genomic stability</em> / integrity by avoiding random recombinations. <a title="Link: https://class.coursera.org/epigenetics-002/lecture/19" href="https://class.coursera.org/epigenetics-002/lecture/19">[3]</a> <br />Again, in cancer cells the situation is the opposite: while in healthy cells  intergenic regions and repetitive elements are heavily methylated, in cancer cells these regions are <em>not methylated</em> at all. <a href="https://class.coursera.org/epigenetics-002/lecture/101" title="Link: null">[4]</a><a title="Link: https://class.coursera.org/epigenetics-002/lecture/101" href="https://class.coursera.org/epigenetics-002/lecture/101"> </a>This in turn leads to<strong> </strong><em>genomic instability</em>, since it allows for illegitmante recombinations <a title="Link: https://class.coursera.org/epigenetics-002/lecture/101" href="https://class.coursera.org/epigenetics-002/lecture/101">[4]</a>, deletions, insertions and transpositions.This genomic instability can promote the growth of cancer and is found in the tissue of many types of cancer.<em><br /></em>Additionally<em>, </em>thi<em></em>s<em> hypomethylation</em> of intergenic regions leads to the activation of certain genes that are normally silenced. This happens due to the lack of methylation of the so-called<em> poor promoters</em> <a href="https://class.coursera.org/epigenetics-002/lecture/101">[4]</a>. Such genes are helping the tumor to grow (<em>oncogenes</em>) and are therefore silenced in normal tissue.<em><br /></em></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The H19/Igf2 cluster is an example where methylation is not a synonym for silencing a gene (here Igf2). In the<em> paternal allele </em>the ICR (imprint control region) in this cluster is <em>methylated</em>. Therefore, an insulator protein (CTCF) cannot bind at this ICR. This, in turn, allows downstream enhancers to promote the <em>expression of the Igf2</em> gene. The H19 gene is silenced by spreading of the methylation from the ICR to the promoter of H19. <a title="Link: https://class.coursera.org/epigenetics-002/lecture/61" href="https://class.coursera.org/epigenetics-002/lecture/61">[6]</a>, Fig. 2 in <a title="Link: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3314145/" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3314145/">[7]</a><br />In the <em>maternal allele</em>, the ICR is unmethylated, which allows an insulator protein (CTCF) to bind. Therefore, the downstream enhancers can no longer act on Igf2, but are<em> redirected to the H19 gene</em>. Hence, on the maternal allele H19 is active while Igf2 is silent.<a title="Link: https://class.coursera.org/epigenetics-002/lecture/61" href="https://class.coursera.org/epigenetics-002/lecture/61">[6]</a>, Fig. 2 in <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3314145/">[7]</a><br /><br />In Wilm's tumour this imprinting is disrupted. Instead of having the ICR at the maternal allele unmethylated,<em> both the maternal and paternal alleles are methylated.</em> <a title="Link: https://class.coursera.org/epigenetics-002/lecture/99" href="https://class.coursera.org/epigenetics-002/lecture/99">[8]</a> This leads to an <em>overexpression of Igf2</em>, since both the paternal and maternal alleles of this gene are expressed. This overexpression contributes to growth in Wilm's tumour. H19, in contrast, is no longer expressed at all.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">When treating cancer, many drugs that affect the epigenetic machinery are currently developed. One important class are<i> DNA-demethylating agents</i>, to which Decitabine is counted. <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168">[9]</a> It is a <i>DNMT inhibitor</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decitabine">[10]</a>, which means that it binds to DNMTs making them inactive. <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168">[9]</a> Therefore, the ability of the epigenetic machinery to inherit DNA methylation by mitosis is decreased. Hence, <i>DNA methylation decreases over cell replication cycles</i>.<br /><br />The effect is that<i> tumour suppressor genes</i>, which are hypermethylated in cancer cells, get unmethylated and<i> become expressed</i>. This can lead to death of the tumour cells and cause an anti-tumour effect.<a title="Link: https://class.coursera.org/epigenetics-002/lecture/111" href="https://class.coursera.org/epigenetics-002/lecture/111">[11]</a> Although the drug affects all cells, the effect on tumour cells is much higher due to their<i> increased groth rate</i>, which speeds up the demethylation of the DNA. <a title="Link: http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168">[9]</a><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Dr. Stephen Baylin applied <em>azacitidine</em> to demethylate DNA <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168">[9]</a>. This drug is a<em> DNMT inhibitor</em>, which means that it does not acitvely remove the methyl groups from the DNA. Instead, after cell division DNMT is deactivated and cannot reestablish the methylation of both strands. In these daugther cells only one strand of the DNA is methylated if both where methylated before division. Once this methylation is removed, this state can last during the livetime of the cell and is<em> mitotically inheritable</em> <a title="Link: https://class.coursera.org/epigenetics-002/lecture/111" href="https://class.coursera.org/epigenetics-002/lecture/111">[11]</a>. Therefore, the effects of the drug last much <em>longer than the treatment </em>(maybe even for the rest of the patient's life).<br /><br />A<em> sensitive period </em>is a time during development where a lot of epigenetic reprogramming is taking place. In such periods the epigenetic state resulting from this reprogramming is very sensitive to<em> influences</em> from outside. Two very prominent sensitive periods are the<em> primordial germ cell development</em> and the<em> early development</em> of an embryo <a href="https://class.coursera.org/epigenetics-002/lecture/71">[12]</a>. During these periods a treatment with drugs that influence the epigenetic machinery would be <em>highly risky</em> as it probably would lead to severe<em> changes in the epigenetic state</em>, e.g., the imprinting of genes. Hence, the side effects of such treatment could be fatal.<br /><br /><br /></div>
