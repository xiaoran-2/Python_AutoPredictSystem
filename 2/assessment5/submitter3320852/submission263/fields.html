    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA
methylation is among others one of the central epigenetic
control mechanisms. In a normal cell that is not affected by cancer, DNA
methylation at CpG islands reduce the effectiveness of the
associated promotor and hence reduce the upstream gene activity. In cancer
cells, CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated (i.e. more methylated than in a
normal cell) which increases the activity of oncogenes (e.g. growth-related
genes) that are otherwise suppressed leading. Therefore, the cell growth
is stimulated which contributes to cancer. </span></p>

<p>In
contrast to CpG Islands, intergeneic regions and repetitive elements tend to be
hypomethylated (i.e. less methylated compared to a normal cell). These regions
are mostly inactivated in a normal cell by methlyation but become active in a
cancer cell stimulating genomic instability in general.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The
expression of the H19/lgf2 cluster depends on the parent of origin due to
different methylation Patterns of the paternal and the maternal allele.</p>

<p><span>The
paternal allele lgf2 is active since the binding site (ICR block) of the
CTCF insulator protein is methylated. Additionally, the H19 promotor is
methylated as well. Hence, downstream enhancers can reach the lgf2 gene, leading
to the expression of the gene. In contrast to the paternal allele, in the
maternal allele this methylation doesn't take place. The ICR block as well as
the H19 promotor are both un-methylated leading to a blocking of the enhancers
and concequently the lgf2 gene is not expressed.</span></p>

<p>Disruption
of the imprinting leads to the Beckwith Wiederman Syndrom wich contributes to
the growth of a Wilm's tumour, In that case, lgf2 (which is a growth
promoting oncogene) is overexpressed. One reason for the overexpression is the
expression of lgf2 on the (normally inactive) maternal allele due to e.g.
methylation of the ICR block and hence disability of the CTCF insulator to
bind. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine
is a DNA-demethylating agent which reduces methylation of the DNA by inhibiting
DNA methyltransferase which may be used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes
(precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia). In case of a tumour, one of the
changes is an overmethylation (hypermethylation) of the DNA in certain regions
(i.e. inactivation of cancer-suppressor genes) which is countered by
decitabine. Hence, these cancer-suppressor genes are active again countering
e.g. cell growth or enabling cell-self-destruction mechanisms again.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>As the
epigenetic state of a cell it mitotically heritable, changes in DNA methylation
are mitotically heritable as well and hence are passed from the treated
(tumour) cell to its daughter cells. </p>

<p><span>While this
kind of treatment offers great chances, the potential side-effects are also
severe as the epigenetic states of the genome may be unselectively changed.
This is especially true for epigenetically sensitive periods, i.e. periods
where large changes in the epigenetic state happen. For instance, during the
development of germ cells. Additionally, the early and post gastrulation stage
of an embryo are highly sensitive. </span></p></div>
