    <h1>Submission 943 from Anon (session_user_id: 8d7cd0bddc242c0bbff18ff1d8a0e2aedbbfe99e)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">

<p class="MsoNormal">Sensitive period is the period when the environment may be
able to influence epigenetic makeup. One sensitive period is the period from
primordial germ cell development through <span> </span>the production of mature eggs and sperm. The
second sensitive period is the pre-implantation period and early
post-implantation period.<span>  </span>Since these
sensitive periods show active remodeling of the epigenome, taking epigenetic
drugs during sensitive period might altered the natural epigenetic regulation, resulting
last/enduring epigenetic changes even beyond the period of drug treatment. Therefore,
we should keep in mind that treating patients during sensitive periods would be
inadvisable. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><a>Decitabine</a>, a specific inhibitor of DNMT,
has been shown to reactivate the expression of genes that suppress malignancy
and is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute
myelogenous leukaemia. Decitabine incorporates into DNA and forms a covalent
bond between the 5-azacytosine ring and DNA methyltransferase, leads to an
inhibition of DNA methylation. This effect can reactiveate the expression of a
silent tumor suppressor gene by dmethylation of cytosine in the promoter
region, resulting in an anti-tumor effect.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Hypermethylation/hypomethylation  of imprint control regions can contribute to
cancer. So cancer cells display the character of loss of imprinting, result in
loss of expression of growth restricting genes, overexpression of growth
promoting genes. In general, genes in normal cells show monoallelic
parent-of-origin-specific expression, however, genes in cancer cells are
expressed from both parental alleles or silent from both parental alleles. For
example H19/Igf2 cluster is the imprint control region in the oval. It’s only methylated
on the paternal allele, but not on the maternal allele. When it's unmethylated
CTCF binds its insulator element, and the enhancers will act on H19. But Igf2
will be silent for the maternal allele, leads to no expression. Whereas, on the
paternal allele, because this is methylated, and the enhancers act on IGF2, resulting
in IGF2 expression from the pattern allele. However, Wilm’s tumour induced hypermethylation
of ICR and Igf2 overpression, because hypermethylation of the imprint control region
on the maternal allele is happened as well. Therefore, there will be a double
dose of Igf2 expression compared with a normal cell. Igf2 is both growth promoting,
and associated with Wilm's tumour. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mechanism that
regulates genes expression by adding a methyl group on CpG island and it is commonly
regarded as a silencing mechanism. DNA methylation is involved in various normal
developmental processes including genomic imprinting, X-chromosome
inactivation, suppression of repetitive elements and maintain genomic  stability. In mammals, tissue- and cell type–specific
DNA methylation exists in a small percentage of 5′ CGI
promoters, whereas the majority of DNA methylation occurs in intragenic, intergenic
regions and repetitive elements. Given the critical role of DNA methylation in
gene expression and cell differentiation, it seems obvious that errors in
methylation could give rise to a number of devastating consequences, for
example carcinogenesis. Cancer cells exhibit hypermethylation within the
promoter regions of many CpG island-associated tumor suppressor genes, such as
the retinoblastoma gene (Rb1), glutatione S-transferase pi (GSTP1), and
E-cadherin (CDH1). On the other hand, cancer induced <a>genome-wide
DNA hypomethylation </a>and leads to genomic instability. Therefore, tumor
suppressor hypermethylation and genome-wide DNA hypomethylation are the
contributions of DNA methylation to cancer.</p>
