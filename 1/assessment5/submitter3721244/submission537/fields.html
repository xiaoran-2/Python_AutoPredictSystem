    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are usually kept free of methylation independent of their
activity state. For example, a CpG island near of tumour suppressor gene will
be unmethylated, and the gene could be transcript. In cancer, the methylation of CpG cause the silencing of the tumour
suppressor gene.The methylation of the promoter CpG islands of the tumour suppressor
genes cause the lost of the control of the cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair.</p><p>On the one hand Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually
methylated in normal cells, on the other hand, in cancer these regions are
unmethylated. This could cause genomic instability and deregulation of tissue
specific and imprinted genes and silencing of tumour suppressor genes.</p><p><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On one hand, in normal cells, as
it is shown in the picture of the cluster, Igf2 is expressed only in the
paternal allele while H19 is only expressed in the maternal allele. This is happen
because H19 is methylated on the paternal allele. The enhancer of the paternal
allele encourage of the Igf2. However, the enhancers of the maternal allele,
due to the union of the molecule CTCF to the ICR, encourage the expression of
H19.</p><p>

</p><p><span>On the other hand, in Wilm’s
tumour, Igf2 is expressed in both alleles. Due to DNA methylation of the ICR of
the maternal allele. This overexpression of Igf2 is the cause of the Wilm’s tumour,
because Igf2 is growth promoting. And it is an example of loss imprinting.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>To DNA-demethylating agents.</p><p>It reduces the amount of
histone overmethylation.</p><p><span>Overmethylation produce misregulations and it affect, for example, to
tumour-suppressor genes silencing it. Then, Decitabine, which is a
DNA-demethylating agent, can reduce the amount of histone overmethylation
restoring the DNA regulation and stop the uncontrolled cell growth that causes
cancer.</span></p><p><span><br /></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Because epigenetic changes are
passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they
are actively erased, and once erased, they do not return.</p><p>Is the period when epigenetic
marks need to be cleared between generations to restore pluripotency.</p><p>Pre-impantation period early
development and primordial germ cell development.</p><p><span>Because in these periods, the
epigenetic reprogramming must follow an order. For example, in early
development paternal genome demethylation occurs faster than maternal genome
demethylation. And the use of these drugs can alter this process. </span></p></div>
