    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation
is the basis for different epigenetic phenomena such as imprinting and X
chromosome inactivation (1). Usually, <b>CpG
islands</b> are kept free of methylation, so its gene could be expressed.
However, in cancer promoter CpG islands tend to become <i>hypermethylated</i>, which typically causes genetic silencing. When
this happens in the so-called <b>Tumor
Supressor Genes</b>, they are not expressed, bestowing the affected cells one
of the hallmarks of cancer, evading growth suppressors. CpG island methylation
is an hereditable feature, thus <i>increases</i>
as the tissue become more malignant, from a normal cell to an invading tumor. Furthermore,
tumor suppressor hypermethylation is often more frequent than mutations, and
unlike them, is <i>reversible</i>.</span></p>

<p><span>On the other
hand, <b>Intergenic regions and Repetitive
elements</b> are routinely methylated in a normal cell, which is associated
with genomic stability, e.g. silencing transposable elements. Genome-wide
hypomethylation is found in all tumors type. Represents an early event and
progresses with tumorigenicity. However, the consequence of hypomethylation
depends on the affected location. When <b>repeats</b>
become hypomethylated, <i>genomic
instability</i> is produced through many mechanisms, such as illegitimate
recombination, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic
promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes. The result is an abnormal karyotype,
due to deletions, reciprocal translocations and/or insertions. </span></p>

<p><span>Overall, <b>DNA methylation</b> contributes to cancer through
tumor suppressor hypermethylation and/or hypomethylation genome-wide. Its role
is <i>context dependent</i>, being different
in different tumours, and also can be stage specific (early vs late in
tumorigenesis). Likewise, deletion of Dnmt1 can enhance or suppress
tumorigenesis. This is particularly important in order to obtain a positive
outcome with epigenetic therapy.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>An example
of how <b>loss of imprinting</b> could
produce cancer is the hypermethylation of Igf2/H19 cluster. Usually, the <b>paternal allele</b> is methylated, which
allows the enhancers will act on Igf2, so Igf2 is <i>expressed</i> on the paternal allele. On the other hand, is
unmethylated on the <b>maternal allele</b>,
so CTCF could bind to this element, so the enhancers will act on H19, <i>avoiding</i> expression of Igf2 on the
maternal allele. Nevertheless, when the maternal allele is hypermethylated, the
maternal Igf2 is also expressed, causing a <u>double amount</u> of Igf2 expression.
Since Igf2 is a <b>growth promoter</b>,
this produces Wilms’ tumour, a child kidney cancer. </span></p>

<p><span>Therefore,
alterations in DNA methylation at the <b>Imprinted
Control Regions</b> (ICRs) could cause <i>silencing</i>
of growth restricting genes, or <i>overexpression</i>
of growth promoting genes. This represents both a common and early event in
precancerous tissue, and one of the common features of cancer cells is <b>loss of imprinting</b>, so they expressed
both parental alleles or both are silent.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine
is an epigenetic drug that belongs to the <b>DNA-demethylating</b>
group, along with Vidaza. Both are FDA approbed for the treatment of
myelodysplatic syndromes that progressed to acute myeloid leukemia. </span>Decitabine <span>works
against <i>DNA Methyltransferase</i> (DNMT), therefore is a <b>DNMT inhibitor</b>. </span></p><p><span>It represents
a nucleoside analogue which <b>binds irreversibly</b> to DNMTs <i>after</i> they are incorporated to DNA, being division-dependent.
Because cancer cells replicate faster than normal cells, they are more affected.
However, </span>DNMT inhibitors<span> cause <b>DNA demethylation</b>
in <i>all</i> the cells. Decitabine may have
an anti-tumor effect because malignancies that are dependent on <i>CpG hypermethylation of</i> <i>tumor suppressor genes</i> –like Haematological-
would be affected if methylation decreases. However, Decitabine may also act in
other ways yet to be discovered.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Drugs
that alter <b>DNA methylation</b>, like DNMT inhibitors, could have a lasting effect beyond
the period of use because <i><u>epigenetics
changes are heritable</u></i>, they are passed on during cell division. However, the use of </span>DNMT inhibitors <strong>should be avoided</strong> during periods of active
growth and development. This is because moments of <b>epigenetic reprogramming</b> are extremely
sensitive, and any alterations within these periods could have a great
impact on the individual. Those <em>sensitive periods</em> are the Early development (<i>Blastocyst</i>) and the Primordial Germ Cell
Development (<i>fetus</i>).</p>

<p><span>DNA
methylation is indeed <b>essential</b> for
many physiological process (imprinting, X chromosome inactivation, etc.) during
development. Thus, it is obvious that the ingestion of a drug that could hamper
the normal functioning of DNMTs could have serious and hazardous effects on
overall health. An example of an altered epigenetic reprogramming is how the <b>environmental influence</b> could act during
this sensitive periods; e.g. maternal exposure midgestation to the fungicide Vinclozin
produces 90% male infertility. </span></p></div>
