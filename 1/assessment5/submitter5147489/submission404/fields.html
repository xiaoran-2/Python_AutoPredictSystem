    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is essential for normal
development. <span>CpG islands generally
found in the promoter region of tumor suppressor genes are normally
hypomethylated allowing the expression of these genes. </span>DNA methylation at CpG islands causes silencing of the gene. In cancer, DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted. Genes
that control cell cycle essential steps control cell growth and multiplications
are disrupted by hypermethylation or hypomethylation. Tumor suppressor
genes are hypermethylated (silenced) and oncogenes are hypomethylated
(activated).</p><p><span>
<span>Hypomethylation of oncogenes activates them
and cause cancer cell to grow/divide/etc. Hypermethylation of tumor suppressor
genes stop normal regulation of cell cycle or correction mechanism of DNA. For
example disables apoptosis or repairing DNA.  Normally these regions and elements
are highly methylated and hence transcriptionally</span></span> silent<span>. </span>Typically, cancer cells exhibit hypomethylation of intergenic
regions.  In
cancer often these regions are hypomethylated. These regions and elements can
change their position inside the genome and cause genetic aberrations. High
methylation prevents their migration and promotes genome stability. In cancer
hypomethylation enables migration. This trans location can divide tumor
suppressor gene and render him useless. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>In normal case scenario, in Igf2/H19 cluster ICR is
hypermethylated on the paternal allele and hypomethylated on the maternal
allele. Therefore the enhancers on the maternal allele act on H19 , but not on
Igf2 (which is silenced), while on the paternal allele enhancers can act on
Igf2  but cannot act on H19 (which is
silenced). So, in normal case scenario Igf2 is expressed only from the paternal
allele. In Wilms tumor cancer cells because of hypermethylation of ICR there is
loss of imprinting on the maternal allele therefore there is expression of Igf2
on both alleles (double dose) favor growth promotion and appearance of Wilms
tumor.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent which acts
by inhibiting DNA-methyltransferases.It is used in myelodysplastic syndromes to
demethylate the CpG islands in the promoter region of tumor suppressor genes,
thus enabling the expression of these genes and limiting the proliferation of
cancer cells. Azacitidine is DNA-demethylating agent which has
hypomethylation effect on CGIs in the promoter regions of some tumor suppressor
genes and this effect is mitotically heritable conferring durability to this effect.
Treatment with drugs that target the epigenome during the sensitive periods of
embryonic preimplantation or primary germ cell formation (mid-gestation) when
the epigenome is resetting  is not
recommended because of unknown and possible extensive effects.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>In normal cells, CpG islands are
often unmethylated. In cancer, DNA methylation of CpG islands often inactivates
suppressor genes; cells divide indefinitely. In
normal cells, intergenic and repetitive regions are often methylated and
densely packaged. If intergenic and repetitive elements become hypomethylated,
they disrupt other genes activity leading to cancer. DNA methylation causes
mitotic heritable epigenetics changes that can last beyond the period of drug
treatment. </span>Sensitive period is when
epigenetic marks is cleared or reprogrammed, such as primordial germ cells and
pre-implementation development. Treating patients in sensitive periods is inadvisable
because it cause long lasting effects for next generations as it not only
effects the embryo but also the germ cells developing in the embryo gets
affected leading to consequences appearing in the future generations.</p></div>
