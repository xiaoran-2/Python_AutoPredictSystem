    <div class="field-value">Normally, CpG islands are not methylated. However, when CpG islands are hypermethylated, they can silence the expression of the gene they direct. If they silence the expression of tumor suppressor genes, this can cause cancer. <br />In normal cells, CpG islands are unmethylated, while intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated. In cancer cells however, CpG islands are methylated while intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated. These changes in methylation, such as intergenic regions being hypomethylated can cause disruptions in the rest of the genome. Since those regions that are normally not expressed are now being expressed, they could cause aberrant expression patterns of the rest of the genes that are surrounding them. There could be over expression of other genes, which could be oncogenes. There could also be disruptions to coding regions. In addition, repetitive elements can very easily recombine with each other because of so much sequence similarity, this recombination is prevented by methylation. However, when there is hypomethylation of repeats it makes them more likely to undergo reciprocal translocations, or for insertion or deletions to take place among them. Together, all these modifications lead to genomic instability, which is a characteristic feature of many cancers.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Disruptions of imprinting can contribute to cancer, such as hypermethylation of imprint control regions (ICRs). One example of this is the H9/Igf2 cluster, which is paternally imprinted. The maternal allele has an unmethylated imprint control region. In the maternal allele, because the ICR is unmethylated, CTCF can bind to it. CTCF is an insulator protein, which insulates Igf2 from the downstream enhancers, so in then the enhancers bind to the H19 site in the maternal allele. H19 is a long non-coding RNA. In the paternal allele, however, the ICR is methylated, so CTCF cannot bind to it and so the enhancers are free to bind to their preferred site, the Igf2 cluster. The DNA methylation in the ICR of the paternal allele also spreads to the H19 promoter. <br />In Wilm's tumor, the maternal allele is also methylated, so there is double the dose of Igf2, which is a growth promoting gene, so leads to cancer. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor. It inhibits DNA methylation. for instance, Decitabine can help in cases where DNA hypermethylation is causing the lack of expression of tumor suppressor genes. Decitabine will decrease the methylation and thus enable tumor suppressor genes to be expressed. Cancer cells replicate more rapidly so they are more affected by these drugs than normal cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that alter DNA methylation, that for example, inhibit DNA methylation, can be effective for genes that are hypermethylated, however , if administered in high enough doses, they can have effects on the rest of the epigenome. They could cause hypomethylation in other regions, which could lead to cancer, or genomic instability. <br />A sensitive period is one in which the epigenetic marks are being layed down. For instance during development, the main sensitive periods are during early embryonic development, and during primordial germ cell development. During these periods is when epigenetic marks are erased and new ones are layed down. Therefore, if there are drugs that affect DNA methylation, they would have an effect in these periods. For pregnant women, taking one of this drugs will likely cause problems for the child, and if the child survives to reproductive age, it could have adverse effects for that child's fertility as well. </div>
