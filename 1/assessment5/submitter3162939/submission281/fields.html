    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer there is relative genome-wide hypomethylation
along with CpG island relative hypermethylation. In normal (non-cancerous)
cells the CpG islands that lie in the promoter regions of genes are generally
non-methylated. Hypermethylation of these CpG islands in cancer leads to
inactivation (non-expression) of genes some of which have tumor suppressor properties.
The suppression of a tumor suppressor allows for unchecked cellular
proliferation.</p>

<p>The intergenic and repetitive regions of DNA if
hypomethylated (due to lack of DNA methyltransferases) often leads to DNA
instability with aberrant mitosis and abnormal chromosomal recombination which predispose
to development of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting can lead to cancer.</p>

<p>As an example, the gene for Igf2 , a growth promoting
factor, is expressed in the paternal allele but not in the maternal allele.</p>

<p>Expression of Igf2 in the paternal allele is dependent on
silencing of H19 by methylation upstream of this element. H19 has a suppressive
effect on Igf2 activation. In the maternal allele the H19 region is not
methylated which permits suppression of Igf2 expression.</p>

<p>In certain cancers (Wilm’s tumor) the H19 region is
methylated in both paternal and maternal alleles leading to excessive production of
the carcinogenic growth promoting factor IGF2.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA hypomethylation agent that acts by
inhibiting DNA methytransferase.</p>

<p>Excess DNA methylation is often seen in the CpG islands
located in the promotor regions of tumor suppressor genes thereby silencing
expression of these genes and allowing for unchecked cellular proliferation.
Inhibition of DNA methytransferase by Decitabine would result in the loss of
methylation in the promotor regions of the tumor suppressor genes thus allowing
them to re-establish their suppressive effect on excessive cellular
proliferation and cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altered DNA methylation results in abnormal epigenetic
marks in cells that are then transferred to the progeny of these cells leading
to permanent alteration of the function of these cells because of these
abnormal marks. Therapeutic agents that influence DNA methylation can have
lasting effects beyond the period of their administration because of this influence on DNA methylation that is carried
over to the progeny of the treated cells.</p>

<p>Cells are susceptible to altered epigenetic influences
during certain sensitive periods such as in the early zygote stage and pre-adolescent
periods of development. In view of this, treating patients during these
sensitive periods, during which critical epigenetic marks are being placed,
would likely lead to abnormal or absent epigenetic imprinting with disruptive
and aberrant development in the future.</p></div>
