    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is altered in cancer, it looks as if regular hypomethylation in CpG islands and hypermythylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements in a normal state is exchanged during cancer: hypermethylation in CpG islands and hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br /><br />The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is of gene silencing as with the X inactivation chromosome. Nevertheless, in normal cells CpG islands are generally unmethylated. <br />So DNA mehtylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer when they present hypermethyation in some specific locus. This contributes to cancer because this CpG islands are located at the promoters of tumour suppressors genes and the DNA methylation is silencing them. This type of disruptions causes the cell to grow or to divide rapidly. <br />In addition, DNA methylation is found in CpG island shores, this is associated to gene expression in some tumours according to Hassler and Egger (2012). <br /><br />In the case of intergenic regions and repetitive elements, normally these regions are hypermethylated and the normal function of DNA methylation is associated to silencing them. This hypermethylation of the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements contributes to mantain genomic integrity and stability. Hypermethylation helps to avoid transcription interfence, duplication or recombination of repetitive elements through the genome.<br />During cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements become hypomethylated and this contributes to cancer because these parts of the genome are able to make transcriptional interference, illegitimate recombination and transpositions causing genomic instability. <br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Since the imprinted genes are related to the the expression of growth, an alteration can result in a lack of growth or overgrowth depending if the ICR is hypomethylated or hypermethylated and the loss of imprinting either from the paternal or maternal allele.<br /><br />Wilm's tumour is an example of this sort of disruption: <br /><br /><div>Normally, the maternal alelle is not methylated so the CTCF, an insulator protein, binds to the ICR and it prevents the enhancers to act on Igf2, which is not expressed on the maternal allele. Instead, the enhancers act on H19 on the maternal allele. <br />In the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated and the CTCF cannot bind to it. So the enhancers are able to bind to Igf2 allowing its expression on the paternal allele.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumour, there is a disruption in the DNA methylation of the maternal allele: the ICR is unmethylated just like the paternal allele. So there is a loss of imprinting of the maternal allele and there is expression of Igf2 in both of the alleles. <br />Igf2 is associated with growth promoting so in Wilm's tumour there is an overexpression of growth contributing to the growth and division of cells and therefore to cancer.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine may be used to treat cancer because it an enzymatic epigenetic regulator, it targets the DNMT1 so it is considered a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. <br />Decitabine works like a nucleoside analog, it goes into the DNA when there is replication and it affects the DNMT1 when this one tries to bind to the nucleotide, instead of separating and copying the methyl group, the DNMT1 stays bound irreversibly. The DNMT1 can no longer copy the methyl group, so hypermethylation decreases during cell division.  <br />Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect because its mechanism helps to stop a propagation of hypermethylation through the inhibition of the action of DNMT1. <br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs altering DNA methylation can have an enduring effect on the epigenome beyond the period of drug treatment because they alter the epigenetic mechanism, this means that they will alter an inheritance system. So the alteration of DNA methylation being heritable can have a lasting effect beyond the treatment period. <br />Nevertheless, it would not be avisable to treat patients with a drug that alters the epigenome during the sensitive periods of epigenetic reprogramming such as primordial germ cell development during the mid-gestation  and the pre-implatantation or early development because during this time, this kind of treatment could alter the parental or maternal imprinting of germ cells or the clearing of DNA methylation during the pre-implantation period. <br />Also, this treatment would not be advisable for children because it could have effects on the development and succesfull maturation of their germ cells.</div>
