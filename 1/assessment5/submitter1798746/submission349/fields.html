    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation affects the function of DNA, often leading to changes in gene transcription, methylation is associated with decreased gene expression and closed structure of DNA. DNA methylation at CpG islands is associated with suppression of gene expression and is one mechanism for controlling promoter activity of a subset of genes. In some cancers, it has been shown, for example, the tumor suppressor genes become methylated at their CpG islands in the promoter region leading to suppression of gene expression for these tumor suppressor genes. DNA methylation at CpG islands can contribute to cancer by turning off the gene expression of a large class of genes, known as tumor suppressor genes. DNA methylation is carried out by a group of related enzymes (DNMTs) DNA methyl transferases that recognize CpG sequences. In addition (hypomethylated sites) cytosines found in intergenic regions and repetitive elements are often hypo methylated sites, disrupted in certain cancers, for example, colon cancer, MDS, lung cancer. The hypomethylation of intergenic sites and repetitive elements can lead to illegitimate recombination, also deletions and insertions of DNA due to genomic instability and open configuration of hypomethylated DNA. Alignment due to repeats in the repetitive elements can occur and the structure of the DNA is open and not closed, closed conformation occurs upon DNA methylation. <br /><span>In general, two patterns of DNA methylation have been observed in cancers, 1) wide areas of global hypomethylation along the genome, and 2) localized areas of hypermethylation at certain specific sites, the CpG islands, within the gene promoter regions.<br />In addition it should be noted that, m</span>ethylated cytosine residues can be spontaneously deaminated to form thymidine residues over time; thus CpG dinucleotides can be deaminated to TpG dinucleotides. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Insulin growth factor 2 (IGF2) on chromosome 11 is regulated by imprinting. CTCF binding on the maternal allele can insulate the enhancers of IGF2 preventing expression but activating H19. The methylation of the paternal allele of the IGF2 prevents CTCF binding leading to H19 promoter and looping of the enhancers that lead to IGF2 gene expression. The binding of CTCF on the maternal allele prevents the enhancer from looping to IGF2 but does allow looping to the H19 promoter and expression of that gene and lack of maternal expression of IGF2, again this is due to CTCF binding on the maternal allele, a process inhibited by DNA methylation on the paternal allele, leading to the enhancers activating IGF2. Imprinting of H19/IGF2 cluter is disrupted inWilms tumor (kidney),  due to loss of imprinting (LOI) of IGF2 and activation of this gene in this type of cancer, insulin growth factor 2 leads to abnormal growth. <span>An increased amount of insulin-like growth factor 2 may stimulate the growth of tumor cells and prevent damaged cells from being destroyed by apotosis. Disrupting imprinting of the H19/IGF2 cluster causes abnormal growth, (Wilm's tumor in kidney) and can also occur in the liver and muscle tissue. </span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a demethylating or hypomethylating agent (structure looks like cytosine, a 5 aza-deoxycytosine derivative) that works on, in part-cancer sensitive/functionally important tumor suppressors, tumor suppressor genes (a class of genes involved in many cancers) that are abnormally methylated in certain cancers. By this process of demethylation, normal function of tumor suppressor genes is restored, restoring control over cell growth. It should be noted that Decitabine is also anti metabolite agent (RNA also) leading to cell death, and Decitabine is used in treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Decitabine can restore the non methylated status of tumor suppressor genes leading to their reactivation and expression of tumor suppressor genes that leads to normal cell growth and division-decreases cancer activities due to the abnormal hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes and this demethylating activity leads to better clinical outcomes for the cancer patient. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that alter DNA methylation have efffects that last beyond the period of the drug treatment due to the covalent modification of DNA, for example methylation of CpGs-these modifications can be transmitted to the daughter cells at cell division leading to long term effects that are inherited. In addition, "<span>Dr Baylin speculates that his epigenetic drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy." A sensitive period would include those times in development whereby methylation and epigenetic changes are being transmitted to germ cells and early stage somatic cells, for example a pregnant women would not be an ideal candidate for epigenetic drugs, often used in certain cancers. The sensitive periods of development would include the embryo, egg production as a baby girl and throughout a pregnancy where imprinting is dynamic and changing due to normal development and would be sensitive to drug induced epigenetic changes. Treating patients, including pregnant women with drugs that affect DNA methylation could lead to both mental and physical retardation of the developing embryo and baby with long term damage to normal development of the baby. </span></div>
