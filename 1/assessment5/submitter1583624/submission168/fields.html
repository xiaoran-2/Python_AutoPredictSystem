    <div class="field-value">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer. <br />Vertebrate CpG islands are short inter-spaced DNA sequences, mostly non-methylated. They are sites of the transcription initiation. The expression of the genes can be modified by the degree of DNA methylation. Dense methylation mostly suppresses gene transcription.<br />DNA methylation is a crucial factor in development but it also plays a role in carcinogenesis.<br />Methylation of CpG islands in or near a promoter of a gene leads to its silencing. When it happens in the tumor suppressor gene it leads to more rapid cell division and thus development of tumorigenesis. However hypomethylation of an oncogene leads to an over-expression of the gene and allows for tumorigenesis.<br />DNA-wide methylation increases genetic stability in normal cells.<br />But In cancer hypomethylation (most common in repeats) leads to copying errors in the chromosomes such as deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocation and thus genetic instability of the genome.<br />In a cancer cell there appears to be a "swap" where CpG islands are hypermethylated while intergenic regions and repeats are hypomethylated. Errors in the epigenetic process are responsible for carcinogenesis to a much higher degree than mutations.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span> Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster.<br />Igf2 and H19 are reciprocally imprinted genes. H19 is exclusively expressed from the maternal chromosome while Igf2 is expressed exclusively from the paternal chromosome.<br />Normally methylation of the paternal allele takes place at ICR ( imprinting control center) established in primordial germ cells. There is no methylation of the maternal H19 allele.<br />When CTCF complex (insulator protein for Igf2 from down-stream enhancers) binds to the maternal allele than down-stream enhancers act on H19 and not on Igf2 gene.<br />CTFC complex does not bind on paternal allele because of the methylation marks inserted at ICR and thus H19 is silenced and the down-stream enhancers act on Igf2 (insulin like growth factor) which drives its expression.<br />In the normal cells, H19 is expressed from the maternal and Igf2 from the paternal chromosome. However in case of ICT hypermethylation, the offspring cell has 2 doses of Igf2 ,both from the father and no H19 contribution  from the maternal strand (zero dose of H19).<br />This epigenetic error is observed in Wilms tumor. It is the most common kidney disorder in children of 3-4 years of age.  </span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Decitabine may be used to treat cancer.<br />Decitabine belongs to a class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors and thus contributes to a hypomethylation of DNA  It is useful in treating myeloblastic syndrome in which the bone marrow produces deformed blood cells.<br />In this case the tumor suppressor gene (which </span><span>stops the uncontrolled cell growth that causes cancer)</span> inactivation induced by hypomethylation is epigenetically silent. Decitabine, the anti-tumor drug has been linked to reactivation of epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor gene induced by hypomethylation. It is used to treat MDS - the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. It is available on the market while other methylating inhibitors are being investigated</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span> Dr Stephen Baylin speculations in the Economist article.<br />Epigenetics switches genes on and off by methylation or acetylation. Epigenetic marks such as methyl groups are transfered to the nucleotide bases by methyl transferases. Thus mutated enzyme may silence or over-express specific gene in the genome due to the hypo or hypermethylation. In case of cancer hypermethylation increases mutagenecity. However epigenetic changes are reversible unlike mutations. Drugs targeting enzymatic genetic regulators such as small molecule inhibitors may be used to stop cancer. At present there are four FDA approved methyl transferase inhibitors. Their combination with chemotherapeutic drugs may be beneficial.<br />Dr. Baylin speculated that epigenetic drugs somehow alter the tumor cells in a lasting way that made them susceptible to standard chemotherapy. Epigenetic therapy may affect the changes which with subsequent chemotherapy can permanently erase undesirable epigenetic changes .<br />However it is important that the epigenetic therapy does not interfere with the sensitive period  at which time the epigenetic marks are formed. It happens in early embrionic and childhood development and gamete formation. Thus epigenetic therapy is not suitable for younger patients and pregnant mothers as the effect on the gametes and embryonic development must be considered.</span><br /></div>
