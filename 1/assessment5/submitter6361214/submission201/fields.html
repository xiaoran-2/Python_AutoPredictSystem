    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Generally in case of a normal cell, CpG islands can be found
hypomethylated, and the intergenic regions, introns as well as the repetitive
elements are found hypermethylated. A reverse of this pattern is noticed in a cancer
cell, just like a rule of thumb. In cancer cells, CpG islands are mostly seen hypermethylated with the intergenic regions being hypomethylated. This may create problem in
the CpG islands because as a result of this hypermethylation, the tumor suppressor genes might become silenced. With the tumor suppressor genes being silenced, it will in
turn allow more rapid cell division, in comparison to its neighboring cells. Thus finally the cell might grow into a tumor, thus contributing to cancer. In the other hand, normally hypermethylation in the
intergenic regions and repetitive elements are associated with greater genomic stability. So
hypomethylation in this sites in case of cancer results in copying errors in the chromosomes, for eg it might lead to insertions, deletions and reciprocal translocations, which in turn contribultes to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the cells near the H19/ Igf2 locus, methylation of the
paternal allele can be generally observed at the ICR, while no methylation can
be seen for the maternal allele. The CTCF complex then binds to the allele
present in the maternal strand. As a result of this, the downstream enhancers act on
H19. But this CTCF complex does not bind to the paternal allele because of the
methyl marks present in them. This leads to silencing of the H19 gene as the enhancers
will inturn drive expression of Igf2. So in case of a normal cell, it can be
seen that a normal dose of both H19 from the maternal strand, and Igf2 from the
paternal strand is present. But, when this ICR turns hypermethylated, both the
strands appear as paternal origin and as such, gets expressed the same way. It
means, the entire process gets a doubled amount of growth promoting Igf 2,
while no dose of H19. This condition is thus associated with Wilm’s tumor. And thus this disrupted imprinting in this cluster contributes to cancer</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a member of a class of DNA methyltransferase
inhibitors. So they are known to contribute towards hypomethylation of DNA.
This in turn can be found helpful in treatment of Myelodysplatic syndrome, a
condition where deformed blood cells are produced by the bone marrow. This
condition is a precursor of acute myelogenous leukemia. So the anti tumor
effect of Decitabine has been found to be linked with reactivation of
epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor genes which is being induced by
hypomethylation effect of Decitabine. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a type of regulation that can be very
much helpful in targeting treatments. This is so because DNA methylation if been manipulated once, the effects of this manipulation can be ensured to be
maintained as methyl marks and be well preserved during mitosis by DNA
methyltransferase. But these worldwide interventions might hinder with the
ordinary functions that the system carries out, mostly during the sensitive periods- in that time when extensively epigenetic reprogramming actually
occurs, i.e during gamete formation and early development. Henceforth, it would be advised that such treatments are not being
prescribed to pregnant mothers, this includes even those with a few months
before conceptions, because reprogramming happens a lot in early stages of
development of a child and also during the formation of gametes, both in males
as well as females.</p></div>
