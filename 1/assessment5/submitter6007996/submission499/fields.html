    <h1>Submission 499 from Anon (session_user_id: 6ed84db4eded1d114458ed10ebd31217d9d34ec1)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is an anticarcinogen used for treating some forms of leukaemia. It works as a blocker of DNA methylatransferases, an enzyme that catalyzes DNA methylation, thus reducing the level of DNA methylation on specific locations in the genome. Since some cancer diseases have been linked to hypermethylation of some genes, mostly tumour suppressing genes, this an attempt to treat cancer diseases by preventing epigenetic mutations. So far the drug has shown better results with tumour tissues that are not compact and it doesn't seem to hurt the neighbouring normal cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>H19/Igf2 cluster consists of several regions: H19 gene (codes for long non-coding RNA), Igf2 gene (growth promotor), enhancers regions and imprint control region (ICR). In normal cell there are two H19/Igf2 alleles, the maternal (not methylated) and the paternal (methylated). CTCF is an insulator protein that prevents enhancers to act on Igf2 region. CTCF protein can bind only on unmethylated ICR region, that is maternal region. After bindig of CTCF, enhancers will act on H19 region and enhance expression of that gene. H19 lncRNA limits cell proliferation. On paternal allele CTCF can't bind on ICR and therefore nothing prevents enhancers from acting on Igf2 gene. On paternal allele H19 region is also methylated. Igf2 growth promotor will be expressed only from paternal gene in normal cell.</div><div><br /></div><div>In a cancer cell ICR region is hypermethylated on mathernal allele. Enhancers on both maternal and paternal alleles will act on Igf2 region and stimulate its expression. Thist means double dose of Igf2 and since it is a growth promotor, it will result in rapid growth of the cell. Meanwhile, H19 lncRNA is not expressed and can't inhibit the growth. This epimutation is seen in Wilm's tumor, the disease that affects kidneys.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>DNA methylation is a chemical reaction of converting cytosine into 5-methylcytosine. It happens almost exclusively on cytosines that are followed by guanines (so called CpG dinucleotides). Those CpG dinucleotides are not equally distributed through the human genome, rather they are clustered in the groups called CpG islands. Both CpG islands and CpG shores (regions next to CpG islands) are regions where gene promotors are located. Methylation of DNA causes genes to be silenced. Because most genes are needed, CpG islands are usually protected from being methylated. If a gene promotor in the CpG island is methylated, the gene it controls will not be expressed. If that gene is needed for normal functioning of the cell, its silencing will cause cell dysfunctioning.</div><div><br /></div><div>In contrast, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated. They compose the largest part of human genome and they have role in maintaining integrity of a genome: protecting it from deletions, insertions, translocations etc.</div><div><br /></div><div>In a cancer cells intergenic regions are usually hypomethylated, while CpG islands are hypermethylated (opposite than in normal cell). Hypermethylation in cancer cells is usually locus specific and happens on the promotors of tumour suppressor genes. Cells with those epimutations will grow and divide much faster and have a competitive advantage over normal cells. Hypomethylation of intergenec regions (usually in the repetitive regions) causes genome to be less stabile.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that alter DNA methyylationn can have effect that last beyond the period of drug treatment because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. Once the DNA methyltion is altered, all daughter cells will have those same marks.<br /><br />However, most epigenetic marks are removed during the germ cell development and early embrionic development. This is imporant because, in order to produce all types of cells that organism needs, a somatic cell must be converted back into pluripotent stem cell. Periods when a cell undergoes through the removal of epigenetic marks is called sensitive period, and there are two in human life cycle (gametogenesis and early embrionic development).<br /><br />During sensitive periods not all epigentic marks are completely removed. For an example, repetitive elements are never unmethylated because that would cause genome to be unstable and some dangerous mutations might happen. Imprinted regions are unmethylated during germ cells development, but not during early embrionic development. If a patient would be treated with drugs that block DNA methyltransferases during the sensitive period, that might cause hypomethylation of intergenic regions which need to be methylated. Moreover, those drugs might disrupt overall process of genetic reprogramming and cause epimutations.</div>
