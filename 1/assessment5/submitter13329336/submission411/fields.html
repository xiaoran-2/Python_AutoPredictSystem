    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div> Normal cells have DNA hypomethylation at CpG islands, this prevents activation of the repetitive elements, maintaining genome stability.<br /> DNA  hypermethylation of CpG islands silences tumour suppressor genes in cancer. It is mitotically heritable and is rapidly selected for, thus enabling rapid proliferation in cancer. It is reversible therefore potentially treatable with medication. <br />Disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands is often the “second hit” in addition to the initial genetic insult/s leading to cancer development. It becomes more extensive over time as cancer progresses to becoming invasive. CpG island hypermethylation assists with diagnosis, eg GSTP1 in prostate cancer,; prognosis, eg miR-34b/c in metastases; and in predicting treatment response.<br /> Normally DNA hypermethylation occurs in intergenic regions and repetitive elements, keeping the chromatin densely packed. It’s function is to maintain genomic stability to prevent recombination chromosomal abnormalities, eg translocations, deletions or insertions.<br />DNA hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is widely seen in cancers, it occurs early and is mitotically inheritable; it can lead to transcription errors and genomic instability in cancer, eg mutation DNMT3B in ICF syndrome, however the effect of DNA hypomethylation is context dependent, modifying either oncogenes or tumour suppressor genes. Methylation also varies at different stages of cancer development<br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In Wilm’s tumour there is the standard hypermethylation
of the ICR  in the paternal allele this increases
Igf2 expression status as in the normal cell. <br />But instead of the normal hypomethylation of the ICR on the maternal allele, there is now also hypermethylation in
the ICR , this now increases the Igf2 expression status
to double that of the normal cell. <br />Disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2
cluster contributes to cancer because this is a gene involved in growth, as is
common in imprinted genes, so it leads to proliferation. This is an early event
in  Wilm’s tumourigenesis, before
neoplasia is clinically evident.<br /></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Decitabine belongs to the
class of epigenetic inhibitors that target DNMT (DNA methyl transferase enxyme),
therefore inhibit DNA methylation by irreversible binding during replication; they
can reactivate silenced tumour suppressor genes in the lab invivo, although their
exact mechanism of action in patients is unclear. They are approved by FDA for myelodysplastic
syndrome which is a precursor to Acute myeloid leukemia.  (The effectiveness  of DNMT inhibition in these tumors may be because they depend heavily on CpG Island
hypermethylation for proliferation, this is already known to be a poor prognosticator in MDS)</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have
enduring effects on the epigenome  as
epigenetic markers are mitotically inheritable, explaining the longevity of
epigenetic modifications.  <br />During sensitive periods, there
is extensive remodeling of epigenetic markers, (they are removed and then reestablished).
This occurs during pregnancy in the blastocyst stage prior to implantation around days 4 - 5 , and  while the embryo is developing the primordial germ cells around days
10 to 15.5. Using epigenetic modifying drugs at the time of early pregnancy would
have a potentially devastating effect not only on fetal development but also on
future generations.<br /></p></div>
