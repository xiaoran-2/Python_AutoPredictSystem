    <h1>Submission 187 from Anon (session_user_id: 0d58cc7fc58d85ac0bf515a6bdaa2248b53bcee9)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The drug Decitabine (also known as Dacogen, developed by Eisai, a Japanese compony) belongs to the group of DNA-Methyltransferase-Inhibitors. These kind of drugs get incorporated into the DNA upon replication, and then, when the DNA-Methyltransferase (DNMT1) comes along to bind that nucleotide to then copy the methylation to the daughter strand, that DNMT is bound irreversibly and it can not longer be released. Means the action of DNMT inhibitors is division dependent so you have to have the cell replicating. Cancer cells dividing much more rapidly than most other cells, so they will be more severely affected, because they are replicating more. DNMT inhibitors seem to be causing DNA-Demethylation and so have an anti-neoplastic effect. As we know  tumour/cancer tissue is highly hypermethylated at tumour suppressor genes.

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">The normal function of DNA Methylation at CpG islands (in promoter region of genes) is to regulate gene expression. High methylation means decrease gene expression , because e.g transcription factors can not bind with high affinity. Low methylation results in increased gene expression. DNA methylation of CpG islands is abnormal hypermethylated in cancer.  This can contribute to cancer, because of the hypermethylation of the CpG islands in the promoter regions of tumour suppressor genes. So they can not be transcribed and  leads to a decreased expression. <br />The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to maintain genomic integrity. Intergenic regions and repititive elements are normally methylated. This may prevent illegitimate recombination and transposition. In cancer there is a lack of methylation, means hypomethylation at intergenic regions and repititive elements and this was found in all cancer studies. The disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repititive elements contributes to cancer, because this results in genomic instability, illegitimate recombination and transposition of repeats.

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Normal: At the paternal allele the ICR and the promoter of H19 is hypermethylated, this mean the enhancer is associated with Igf2 (oncogene, growth promoting). DNA methylation at ICR blocks binding of CTCF (CTCF is an insulator protein, insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers binding), without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence and enhancers can access Igf2 to activate upregulation of Igf2. But the paternal allele is not imprinted so everthying is fine. At the imprinted maternel allele the ICR and the H19 promoter is hypomethylated. So CTCF can bind to the ICR and promote H19 trancription and silence Igf2 expression.<br />Disrupted imprinting in Wilm´s tumour:   Hypermethylation of ICR at both alleles, DNA methylation at ICR blocks binding of CTCF. This results in  Igf2 overexpression (growth promoting gene, oncogene) and a loss of expression of growth restricting genes.  Common, early event, often seen in pre-neoplastic tissue.

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects an the epigenome, because these alterations can be mitotically inheritent. Most of the drugs that altering DNA-methylation act at the global genome. Perhaps this mean, that other genes, e.g are involved in growth or other metabolic pathways are overexpressed or more active. A sensitive period is a period, where a child easily absorbs information in a specific way (source:<a title="Link: http://study.com/academy/lesson/the-sensitive-periods-of-development-birth-to-age-6.html" href="http://study.com/academy/lesson/the-sensitive-periods-of-development-birth-to-age-6.html">http://study.com/academy/lesson/the-sensitive-periods-of-development-birth-to-age-6.html</a>). Means the period of beeing not adult. In epigentic context: Sensitive periods are the pre-implatation period early development and the primodial germ cell development, for epigenetic reprogramming. Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable, because this could have effects on germ cells. It would change the epigenetic programming for the further life and we don´t know, what other consequences this would have to our organism. E.g. cancer: On the one hand you have an anti-neoplastic effect and on the other hand several other genes could be disrupted. (source: vidoe lectures and lecture slides)<br /><br /><br /></div>
