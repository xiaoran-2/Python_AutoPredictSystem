    <div class="field-value">In cancer, DNA hypermethylation is found at promoter CpG island, instead intergenic regions, genes and repetitive elements are hypomethylated.<br /><br />Normally <em>CpG islands</em> at the promoter of genes are unmethylated, while 
the major part of CGI spread through the genome are methylated. 
Methylated DNA is strictly packed in heterochromatin, so methylation at 
promoter CpG islands is associated with condensation of the chromatin 
and silencing of the genes. <br />DNA methylation at CGI can promote cancer in various ways, for exemple by silencing tumour suppressor genes or silencing the CpG island shores (CGI neighbouring regions) that may contain important genes involved in promoting or repressing growth.<br />Hypomethylation at CpG poor promoters instead can lead to cancer by making accessible a region that was silent before and for exemple causing the activation of an oncogene or activating a miRNA that targets a tumour suppressor, leading to a decreased activation of the suppressor.<br /><br />The function of methylation at <em>intergenic regions</em> is to maintain genomic integrity and to silence cryptic transcription start or splice sites; <br />Loss of methylation at intergenic regions can for example cause the recognition by RNA pol II of a cryptic promoter that is antisense to the original transcript, leading to transcription interference. If the gene is a tumour suppressor, this leads to the loss of the beneficial action of the gene.<br /><br />The function of methylation at <em>repetitive elements</em> is to maintain genomic integrity by
 preventing transposition, preventing mutation of meC in T, avoiding 
transcriptional interference and preventing illegitimate recombination.<br />Loss of methylation for exemple causes the loss of the silencing of the promoters contained in the LTR, that will transcribe genes nearby: in the case of an oncogene, this will lead to its overexpression, promoting cancer.<br /><br />Loss of normal methylation can even be caused by malfunctioning epigenetic modifiers, like DNMT1 and DNMT3A.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">H19/Igf2 cluster has an imprint control region ICR that influences the surroundings. H19/Igf2 ICR is paternally imprinted (this means that the paternal ICR is methylated).<br />On the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated and is bound by an insulator protein CTCF that insulates the upstream gene Igf2 from the downstream enhancers. In this way the enhancers can act on H19 promoter and enhance its expression on the maternal allele (H19 is a reservoir of a miRNA).<br />On the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated. CTCF can not bind ICR and the enhancers therefore can interact with Igf2, promoting its expression. ICR methylation can be spread downstream into the H19 promoter that is silenced.<br />Igf2 is an oncogene (promotes growth).<br />In Wilm's tumour both copies of the ICR are methylated, leading to the expression of Igf2 from both the maternal and the paternal allele: in this way there is a double dose of Igf2. <br />This excess of the oncogene product can enhance cell growth in an uncontrolled manner (tipical feature of cancer cells) and is a very early event in tumorigenesis.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor. Is a cytidine analogue that can be incorporated in the DNA during replication and can afterwards bind the DNA methyltransferase irreversibly, inhibiting its methylating action. <br />Its de-methylating action is very usefull in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome that can progress to acute myelogenous leukaemia.<br />As Decitabine is replication dependent, it affects principally cancer cells that replicate very fast, whereas it has fewer effects on normal cells.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation alteration can be inherited because epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable. <br />Sensitive periods are periods in which epigenetic marks are cleared and re-set and are really suscettible periods; the two sensitive periods of development are the the pre-implantation period (early development) and the primordial germ cells development period. <br />Treating patients during these periods can lead to alterations of the epigenome. This is why I would avoid treating patients for example in the early stages of pregnancy, when the epigenetic marks are being set in the fertilized egg, or during "slow growth periods" when germ cells are maturating because this will cause epimutations in the germ cells that will produce the eggs and the sperms.<br /></div>
