    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normally functioning cells repetitive elements, intergenic
regions, and introns are usually methylated and thus silenced. CpG islands are
hypomethylated; this is especially important at tumour suppressor genes,
because they can be expressed properly.</p><p>In cancer there is genome-wide DNA hypomethylation.
When DNA hypomethylation of repetitive elements, intergenic regions, and
introns occurs in specific regions, their decreased silencing and increased
expression leads to overactive repeats. As a result, the genome destabilises;
illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats,
transposition, and disruption to neighbouring genes occur.</p><p>CpG islands and CpG island shores of specific genes,
often tumour suppressor genes, however, are often hypermethylated in cancers. There
is thus increased silencing and decreased expression; the pathological cells
can proliferate freely.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells the paternal ICR is methylated. CTCF
thus can’t bind to it, and enhancers can act of Igf2 so it can be expressed. In
maternal alleles the ICR is unmethylated. CTCF can bind to it and therewith
block enhancers from acting on Igf2. Enhancers instead act on H19.</p><p>Normally, only one of the two parental alleles is
expressed, but when imprinting is disrupted, H19/Igf2 are either expressed on both
alleles or silenced on both alleles. This can result in silencing of growth
restricting genes or overexpression of growth promoting genes. In Wilm’s tumour,
the growth promoting Igf2 is expressed from both alleles; this means you get
double the dose needed. H19 remains silent on both alleles.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor; some cancers are
caused in part by hypermethylation of tumour growth suppressors. By inhibiting
their methylation, DNMTis reduce and prevent further silencing. DNMTis do not
only targt cancer cells, but also normal cells; because cancer cells divide
more rapidly than normal cells, however, their effect on them is larger than it
is on normal cells.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can be maintained because it is
heritable through mitosis. Sensitive periods are periods of development during
which the epigenome is especially susceptible to environmental signals. These
are the pre-implantation period and primordial germ cell development, where
extensive epigenetic reprogramming occurs; periods of cell differentiation, the
developmental phases of germ cells, and also in vitro cultures. Treating pregnant
mothers with drugs that alter DNA methylation would be inadvisable, because the
epigenome of the developing embryo could be unstable, thus damaged easily, and
might not develop properly. When immature germ cells are affected – for example
in embryos and during childhood –, the effects could also be
transgenerationally heritable.<br /></p></div>
