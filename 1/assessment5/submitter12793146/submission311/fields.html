    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA
methylation is associated with gene silencing may be disrupted in cancer in two
ways: either hypo or hypermethylation. This can occur at various sites. CpG
islands are found in promoter regions. In healthy cells they are usually
hypomethylated, enabling gene expression. In cancer cells they can be
hypermethylated, resulting in gene silencing.  In addition, the shore regions flanking the
CpG island may also be hypermethylated. This may contribute to cancer
especially if the CpG island is located in a promoter for a tumour suppressor
gene. For example genes controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair may be
silenced, leading to aberrant growth of cells. Conversely, for CpG poor
promoters that are normally hypermethylated, resulting in silencing,
hypomethylation in cancer is linked to activation of genes e.g R-RAS.</span></p>

<p><span>In
healthy cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually hypermethylated,
leading to the formation of euchromatin. This silences these regions, reducing
transcriptional noise from alternative start sites. It also helps to prevent
recombination between chromosomes and unwanted repeats or transpositions. In
cancer cells, the removal of methylation marks within these regions enables
unwanted recombination to occur, reducing genomic stability. This can cause
deletions, insertions or reciprocal translocations. In addition expression of
repeats and transpositions may happen, as well as activation of cryptic
promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes. 
The chromosomal instability can lead to tumorigenesis.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption
of imprinting can lead to the activation of a gene that is normally silenced on
one allele. For example, in humans only <span>the gene encoding the insulin-like growth factor-2</span> (Igf2) which is inherited from the father is expressed. This is because the imprint control region
on the paternal allele is hypermethylated, meaning that CTCF will not bind
to the insulator region and there is no expression of H19. The enhancers downstream of H19 then
act on the Igf2 region, leading to expression. On the maternal allele the
imprint control region is unmethylated. This means that CTCF can bind to the
insulator region and H19 is transscribed. The enhancers then act on H19
instead, meaning that Igf2 is not expressed from the maternal allele.</p>

<p>In
Wilm’s tumour, the imprint control region on the maternal allele is
hypermethylated. This means that there is also now expression of Igf2 from the
maternal allele as well as the paternal allele, meaning there is twice the
dose. Igf2 is associated with growth promotion, and the excess of this growth
factor leads to kidney tumours in children.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine
is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. It is a nucleoside analogue, meaning that
it can be incorporated into DNA upon replication. When the DNA incorporating
the nucleoside analogue is read by the DNA methyltransferase, it becomes
irreversibly bound. This means that Decitabine has a hypomethylating effect, as
it removes DNA methylation. This offers a chance to restore hypomethylation in regions which have been incorrectly methylated. The drug affects all cells but impacts on cancer cells more than neighbouring
healthy cells because the cancer cells are dividing more rapidly. For cancers
which are caused by methylation of CpG islands, such as malignancies of the
blood, DNMT
inhibitors may be effective as they remove the hypermethylation marks which are
silencing tumour repressor genes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs
which act upon DNA methylation state can have an effect beyong the treatment
period as DNA methylation is a heritable epigenetic mark. Therefore upon
mitosis, the changes in DNA methylation can be preserved. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>However,
because drugs which have an impact on epigenetic state affect all cells, not
just cancer cells there may be times when they should be avoided. One such
example is “sensitive periods”. These are times where epigenetic marks are
cleared and reestablished. This happens in two clear timeframes, first in early
pregnancy during formation of the blastocyst, second during the formation of
the germ cells. Drugs which can disrupt the formation of methylation patterns
may then affect either the development of the embryo in pregnant women, or for
women who are already pregnant this may prevent the formation of healthy
sperm/eggs in the offspring of parents receiving treatment. Therefore drugs
which alter the laying down of DNA methylation marks should not be used for
women who are about to conceive, or are pregnant. It may be inadvisable to
administer these drugs in early childhood when the gametes are still forming as
this may have an impact on the next generation. </p>
