    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are found in the promoter regions of various genes, and the methylation of such sites results in the suppression of those promoters, and, therefore, the suppression of gene expression. Normally, most of these CpG islands are left unmethylated, however, in cancer, they are hypermethylated, which causes excessive suppression of various genes. Since some of those genes are tumor suppressor genes, their methylation would increase the probability of developing cancer, since those genes would no longer be active. An additional factor could be the overexpression of Oncogenes. These are usually methylated, but in the case of disruption of normal function. they may become demethylated and expressed, increasing the risk of cancer.<br /><br />The intergenic regions and repetitive elements do not code for any proteins, however, they are responsible for various non-coding RNA molecules, therefore, these regions are also often regulated via methylation/demethylation, either increasing of suppressing the expression of various ncRNAs. In cancer, these methylation patterns may be significantly altered. For instance, in cancer cells, excessive expression of the lincRNA HOTAIR was found, pointing to the fact that cancer cells have altered methylation patterns of the intergenic regions. The overexpression of HOTAIR results in a change of the PCR2 complex occupancy at chromatin sites, alters H3K27 methylation patterns and increase cancer invasiveness, all of which are contributory factors in developing cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a hypomethylating drug, which means that it hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. This results in a decrease of methylation in the DNA of a target cell. The authors of the article are not yet completely sure of how the anti-tumour effect works, however, they speculate that decitabine may make drugs more susceptible to standard chemotherapy, which contributes to successful treatment of cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Since DNA methylation can be inherited by daughter cells, it is therefore possible that the use of certain drugs which alter methylation patterns might result in long-term effects, because the cells divide mitotically even after the treatment has concluded. It is especially important to be cautious about using such drugs during the sensitive periods of development, where extensive epigenetic reprogramming occurs. These periods happen during early embryonic and germ cell development.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
