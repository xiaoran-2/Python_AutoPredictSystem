    <h1>Submission 209 from Anon (session_user_id: 443bfa90dcf6f09f4e6f999a20224e7b20701bd6)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA
methylation generally causes long lasting gene silencing. In case of cell
division, the methylations are copied and transferred to the next generation of
cells and the effects endure over time. There are periods in the lifetime in which
the epigenetic marks go through dramatic changes. During these periods of
epigenetic reprograming, any substance or situation capable of alter these
epigenetic marks may have long lasting effects in the expression of proteins
and may eventually produce diseases or developmental alterations. There are two
main sensitive periods, the first is during preimplantation embryo development
and the second is during primordial germ cell development. The use of
treatments capable of alter the epigenetic marks of the cells should be avoided
during these periods because their effect is general instead of directed to the
wrong epigenetic marks responsible of the diseases. Any treatment administered
during these periods could have long lasting side effects or even developmental
alterations.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA
methylation at CpG islands generally causes gene silencing of the surrounding
genes.  CpG islands located in promoters
are usually unmethylated allowing gene expression, but in some types of cancer
there is a hypermethylation of this CpG islands, blocking the expression of the
underlying gene. In some cases, cancer is caused by changes in the metilation state of intergenic regions or repetitive elements. These regions are usually hypermethylated and densely packaged to avoid recombination with other similar areas of the genome. If these regions become hypomethylated, illegitimate recombination may occur provoking genetic instability and eventually the development of cancer.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Changes in the epigenetic state of imprinting control regions (ICRs) may contribute to cancer. One example is the disruptionof the imprinting of the ICR controlling the H19/Igf2 cluster. In a healthy individual, the maternal allele is unmethylated, allowing CTCF to bind and the insulator element will not let the enhancers reach Igf2, which will be silenced. These enhancers will only affect H19 expression increasing it. In the paternal allele the ICR will be methylated, so CTCF will not bind and the enhancers will now reach Igf2 and it will be expressed. In Wilm's tumour both the paternal and maternal alleles are methylated, and this results in a two fold increase in total Igf2 expression, wich is a cell growth promotor. This increase is the on of the causes of the increased cell growth seen in cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Some
types of cancer are associated with high levels of DNA methylation, which
causes silencing of several genes, including tumour-supressor genes, resulting
in uncontrolled cell grouth. Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent that can
be used to reduce this altered methylation and restore cell growth control. </span></p></div>
