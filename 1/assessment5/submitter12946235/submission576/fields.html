    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at CpG islands (especially in the promoter region of genes) is involved in silencing
genes. DNA methylation
at CpG islands can block certain transcription factors from binding (i.e. SP1).
However, CpG islands are more generally bound by methyl binding proteins, which block the
transcriptional machinery from binding. 

<p>In cancer, the CpG islands of the promoters of many genes are hypermethylated (as opposed to being hypomethylated in benign cells).
There are subtypes of cancer where this hypermethylation is exceptionally pronounced (CIMP).<br /></p>

<p>The disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands can lead to
the silencing of tumor suppressor genes (by CpG hypermethylation) or the
activation of oncogenes (by CpG hypomethylation).  </p>

<p>DNA methylation at intragenic regions is important for
preventing aberrant transcription of DNA due to the activation of promoters
from repetitive elements and retroviruses. These promoters often stimulate
transcription in both directions along the DNA strand and this could lead to
transcriptional interference.    </p>

<p>Methylation of repetitive elements is important to prevent
the transcription of repetitive elements (sequences that can copy and re-insert themselves in other locations in the genome). In cancer, intragenic sequences and repetitive elements are
largely devoid of methylation. This has many harmful consequences. Usually,
methylation of repetitive elements protects genomic stability. In cancer cells, repetitive elements are much more active. This
results in gene mutations (if the element inserts itself into the middle of a gene sequence),
gene silencing (if the element inserts itself into the promoter of a gene), and
chromosomal abnormalities [when the elements re-insert themselves in trans,
recombination can occur. This leads to chromosomal
fragments breaking off of one chromosome and attaching to others. The
fragmenting can create fusion proteins by combining two genes. Sometimes fusion
proteins gain an ability to promote tumor growth and/or survival.]  </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine
is a DNA demethylating agent (a DNMT inhibitor). It inhibits methyltransferases by acting as nucleoside analogs. By inhibiting
methyltransferases, Decitabine can induce the hypomethylation of many genes. Some of these will likely be tumor
suppressor genes. The decrease in methylation increased the probability that the tumor suppressors will be transcribed. <br /><br />Also, the
selectiveness of these drugs on cancer cells is due to the fact that each
daughter strand of DNA from a parent cell must be re-methylated by DNMT1 to ensure the
heritability of the methylation and as cancer cells divide faster than most types
of benign cells, they will lose methylation marks faster.

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation marks are heritable. Therefore, the methylation
patterns of a parent cell will be passed down to its progeny. Hemi-methylated strands
are methylated after cell division by DNMT1.This ensures that when cells divide, the daughter cells both receive the methylated cytosines. <br /><p>Sensitive periods are times during early development when the paternal and maternal genomes are cleared and re-set. This makes the genes highly susceptible to any factors that can interfere in laying down de-novo methylation marks. It would not be advisable
to treat patients with epigenetic drugs during periods when the epigenetic code is being written to guide the future development of an organism. Inhibiting
DNA methyltransferases will prevent the new epigenetic marks from being passed
down to new cells. Sensitive periods occur twice; once around the
blastocyst stage of embryonic development (pre-implantation development) and
again during gametogenesis (germ cell development). </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normal cells:<br />The paternal imprint control region (ICR) is usually methylated. Because of this, the CTCF protein doesn't bind to the paternal allele and methylation will extend to H19 on the paternal genes. As H19 is methylated at the paternal allele, this lncRNA will not be transcribed and the enhancers will be able to promote IGF2 transcription (the paternal IGF2 allele). The maternal ICR is usually unmethylated. Therefore, CTCF can bind to it. H19 will be active and block the enhancers from promoting IGF2 transcription from the maternal allele.<br /><br />Wilm's tumour:<br />In Wilm's tumour, the maternal allele becomes also becomes methylated. This results in no H19 transcription from the paternal or the maternal alleles. This allows the enhancers on both paternal and maternal alleles to access IGF2. IGF2 is then transcribed in excessive amounts in these cells, promoting the growth of the tumour.  <br /></div>
