    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are found in promoters of tumour supressor genes, and they are hypomethylated in normal cells.<br />Hypermethylation in CpG islands of tumuor supressor genes implies silencing of these genes.<br />Normal cell becomes aberrant when the first undergoes several hits, like silence of two copies of one tumout supressor gene and activation of one or more oncogenes. Since at least hypermethylation in CpG islands of tumour supressor genes are mitotically heritable, this situation confers a competitive advantage, so this cell will divide more rapidly than the rest.<br /><br />DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements has the function of silencing these regions and elements to avoid insertions or disruptions in other genome-wide regions.<br />In this case, disruption of DNA methylation in these regions and elements means loss of methylation, leading to its expression.<br />Disruption of DNA methylation in these areas contributes to genome instabilty by deletions, inappropiate recombinations, insertions, etc.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In paternal allele ICR is methylated, so enhacers will facilitete the expression of Igf2.<br />In maternal allele ICR is unmethylated, so CTCF is binding to ICR and there will be H19 expression.<br />In Wilm's tumour, ICR of both paternal and maternal allele are methylated, so there are double dose of Igf2. As a consequence, there will be an aberrant growth.<br />Disruption in imprinting at the H19/Igf2 can ocurr when the maternal allele is behavouring like the paternal allele, in other words, when the maternal allele is methylated in ICR.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to DNMT inhibitors family.<br />This drug is a nucleoside analogue that it is incorporates into DNA and links the DNMT, decreasing the histone overmethylation.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Sensitive periods are those in which there is a development process in progress. These periods are critical because some tissues are in formation, and any injury could affect the cell and the tissue phenotype.<br />A different pattern of DNA methylation in each tissue is necessary for the indentity of each cell type. If we interfere in DNA methylation in sensitive periods of development, the result will be unpredictable. Maybe we can found a multiple sets of tumours as a consequence of genome instability.<br /></div>
