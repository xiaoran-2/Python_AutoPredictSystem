    <div class="field-value">The purpose of CpG methylation is to block gene expression. In normal cells, CpG island methylation at repetitive elements and intergenic regions have the effect of stabilizing the genome. CpG islands that are associated with tumor suppressor genes are usually not methylated in a normal cell.<br /><br />In a cancer cell, DNA hypermethylation at CpG islands associated with tumor suppressor genes will cause reduced tumor suppressor gene expression, resulting in increased risk of tumorigenesis. DNA hypomethylation at repetitive elements and intergenic regions will result in activation of these regions, and genome instability.<br /><br />Disruption of DNA methylation of CpG islands associated with repetitive elements and intergenic regions will cause genome instability, resulting in activation of repeats and transpositions. There is also an activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of gene expression. DNA hypermethylation of CpG islands associated with tumor suppressor genes will silence the expression of tumor suppressor gene result in tumorigenesis.<br /><br />In normal cells, DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements has the effect of inactivating these regions, and helps to stabilize the genome. <br /><br />In cancer, DNA hypomethylation in the intergenic regions and repetitive elements will lead to genomic instability. Illegitimate recombination between repeats may occur. There is also activation of repeats and transpositions, and activation of cryptic promoters which disrupt neighbouring genes.<br /><br />The disruption of DNA methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements caused genomic instability. Illegitimate recombinations between repeats, activation of repeats and transpositions, and activation of cryptic promoters may occur. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The imprint control region is methylated on the paternal side. This means that the enhancers can act directly in Igf2 to increase igf2 expression.<br /><br />The imprint control region is unmethylated on the maternal side. This means that CTCF will bind to the insulator element. The enhancers will act on H19, and Igf2 will be silent on the maternal side.<br /><br />During loss of imprinting, hypermethylation on both the paternal and maternal allele will cause the expression of Igf2 to double. Since Igf2 is growth promoting, this will result in tumorigenesis and Wilm's tumor.<br /><br />When there is overexpression of Igf2, Wilm's tumor is a consequence.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to a class of epigenetic inhibitors called DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. It is a drug that inhibits the methylation of DNA. <br /><br />Decitabine causes the demethylation of DNA methyation.<br /><br />Cancers are associated with increased methylation of the CpG islands on the promoters of tumor suppressor genes. This hypermethylation of DNA suppresses the expression of tumor suppressor gene products. Decitabine works by inducing hypomethylation of DNA on the CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes, thus allowing for the prevention of tumorigenesis.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically inheritable. DNA methylation as an epigenetic marker will therefore have enduring effects on the epigenome.<br /><br />A sensitive period is a period of development with epigenetic markers are removed and reprogrammed. There is a phase of active and passive DNA demethylation, which is then followed by a subsequent phase of remethylation.<br /><br />Sensitive periods exist during early embryonic development and during primordial germ cell development.<br /><br />Treating patients during sensitive periods should be done with caution as we do not want to adversely affect the global scale of demethylation and remethylation that occurs during this period. Furthermore, any errors of methylation can be mitotically inheritable, and can have life long consequences on the whole body.</div>
