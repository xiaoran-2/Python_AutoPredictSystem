    <div class="field-value"><div>CpG islands are areas where there are concentrations of adjacent C and G bases. They often occur at the promoters of genes. Methylation of the cytosine bases at a promoter is associated with silencing of the gene. Normally CpG islands are protected from methylation so that necessary genes are active. <br /><br /></div><div>In cancer, there is increased methylation at CpG islands at promoters. This silences the gene. <br /><br /></div><div>“Tumour suppressor genes” are involved in the control of growth. If these genes are silenced then it becomes possible for a cell to grow and divide without control. This is a factor leading to cancer.<br /><br /></div><div>In intergenic regions and repetitive elements, CpG sequences are normally highly methylated. This is thought to inactivate the repetitive elements.<br /><br /></div><div>In cancer, there is a general decrease of methylation throughout the genome, particularly in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br /><br /></div><div>Without methylation, repetitive elements can replicate themselves and spread throughout the genome, inserting themselves into DNA at random positions. They can prevent the proper expression of genes, or they can insert a strong promoter that causes a gene to be over-expressed.  They
can also allow chromosomes to pair incorrectly and give rise to insertions,
deletions and translocations. These genetic disruptions are another factor that can promote cancer.</div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Imprinting is the situation where either the maternal or the paternal allele is silenced. The H19/Igf2 cluster is a maternally imprinted gene.<br /><br /></div><div>The paternal allele has methylation of the imprint control region of Igf2. This prevents the binding of CTCF. Without CTCF, enhancers further along the chromosome can loop to access Igf2 and activate it. Also, the methylation spreads to the H19 region and prevents the expression of H19.<br /><br /></div><div>The maternal allele is not methylated in the imprint control region. This allows CTCF to bind. The enhancers are unable to loop to activate Igf2, and so Igf2 is silenced. The H19 gene is also unmethylated, the enhancers loop to promote its action, and H19 is produced. In this way, Igf2 is maternally imprinted. Only the paternal allele is expressed.<br /><br /></div><div>Wilm’s tumour is a cancer of the kidney found in children. A predisposing factor is a loss of the normal imprinting of Igf2. The maternal imprinting could be lost by mutation or deletion of the control region, giving two active copies of Igf2. Igf2 is an oncogene. It promotes growth. Having two active copies will promote excessive growth which could be a contributory cause of cancer.</div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an antimetabolite drug that is a member of the
class of DNA demethylating agents. It prevents the action of DNA
methyltransferase and therefore stops methyl groups from being added to DNA.</p>

<p>In normal cells, “tumour suppressor genes” are active in
controlling growth. The promoters of those genes have CpG islands that are
unmethylated. In cancer cells, the CpG islands at these promoters tend to be
methylated, silencing the tumour suppressor genes. Unregulated growth can then
occur and lead to cancer. If Decitabine acts to prevent CpG islands at
promoters from being methylated, then the genes could be
reactivated, growth could be regulated, and tumour growth prevented.</p>

<p>Decitabine will also prevent the methylation of CpG in other
regions of DNA such as repetitive elements. This could promote cancer,
therefore it will not be a suitable treatment for every type of cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. That is, the
pattern of DNA methylation is copied to the daughter cells when cells divide,
and this pattern can remain stable for the life of the organism.</p>

<p>Epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation are removed during
the formation of gametes, and replaced by a new set of epigenetic marks that
regulate gene activation in a way that is needed for the gametes. Then, at the
blastocyst stage of early embryo development, many of the epigenetic marks are
removed and reset again. The time when epigenetic marks are being reset is
known as a sensitive period. The sensitive periods of development are the
formation of gametes and the early stage of embryo development.</p>

<p>It would be inadvisable to treat a patient with an
epigenetic drug during a sensitive period because this would prevent the
epigenetic marks from being reset correctly. There could be widespread
disruption of the regulation of genes, preventing the normal development of the
embryo or the normal function of the gametes. Therefore a woman should not be
treated if she might be in the very early stage of pregnancy. Both sexes should
avoid conception for a time after treatment.</p></div>
