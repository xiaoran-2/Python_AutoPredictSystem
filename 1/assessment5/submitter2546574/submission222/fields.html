    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><b></b>     Epigenetic changes in the structure of DNA have been recognised as important contributors in the development of many types of Cancers.            Decitabine is a drug trying to rectify such changes. Decitabine belongs to the <b>class</b> of epigenetic drugs called <b>DNA- demethylating agents</b>.        Decitabine<b> impacts </b>the methylation of DNA  by inhibiting enzyme DNA methyltransferase which is responsible for DNA methylation and thereby causes hypomethylation of DNA. <br />     Due to high methylation, expression of "tumor suppressor genes" can be blocked which may result into neoplastic or cancerous growth. By reducing methylation of DNA, Decitabine lets expression of "tumor suppressor genes" increase and exerts its <b>anti-tumour effect</b>.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value">     DNA methylation profiles of a normal cell and a cancerous cell are very different. <br />     In a normal cell when CpG islands get methylated they are converted from cytosine to thymine due to mutagenic event. Hence <b>CpGs in a</b> <b>normal cell are usually unmethylated</b> and found less frequently. Whereas in a cancerous cell CpG islands found in the promoter regions of several genes are heavily methylated. Thus normal pattern of DNA methylation at CpG islands in a cancerous cell is disrupted. This heavy methylation of CpGs cause silencing of some "tumour suppressor" genes as well as the genes responsible for cell death. According to <b>Knudson hypothesis</b>, cancer is the result of several hits. And heavy DNA methylation of certain CpGs is one such important hit.<br />     In a normal cell <b>intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated</b> and thereby are silenced. Normal function of DNA methylation at such sites is believed to be that of maintaining genomic integrity. According to the <b>Genome Defense Model</b> proposed by <b>Prof.</b> <b>Timothy Bestor</b>, primary function of DNA methylation at repetitive elements is to protect genome from transposable elements. <b>In a cancerous</b> <b>cell</b> however, the<b> intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated</b> meaning, less or no methylation is found at these regions. Due to this hypomethylation, more of  chromosomal deletions, reciprocal translocations, insertions and duplications of whole chromosomes can occur.<br />     Thus combined effect of hypermethylation of CpGs and hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements trigers <b>instability in the genome</b>. This instability can lead to uncalled for silencing of "tumor suppressor" genes or over activation of "oncogenes". And finally if enough of such hits accumulate, then it can lead to neoplastic cell growth or cancer.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">      Imprinted gene cluster situated on chromosome 11 is H19/Igf2 having "enhancer blocking" mechanism. Imprint control region/ICR is in the middle of this cluster. <br />      ICR is unmethylated in <b>maternal allele</b> allowing insulator protein CTCF to bind. Due to this enhancers downstream are not able to activate Igf2 gene upstream to ICR hence Igf2 is silenced in maternal allele. Enhancers now activate H19 gene downstream to ICR to produce a lncRNA H19 acting as a reservoir for some mRNAs.<br />      ICR in <b>paternal allele</b> is methylated. Due to this, CTCF is unable to bind and hence enhancers can now activate expression of Igf2. Methylation of ICR spreads to the promoter of H19 gene resulting in silencing of H19. So <b>paternal allele is imprinted</b> in this case.<br />      <b>Wilm's tumour</b> is a kidney tumour. Due to disruption of imprinting in maternal allele, two alleles act like paternal allele resulting in <strong>uniparental</strong> <strong>disomy</strong>. Due to this Igf2 which is a oncogene is overexpressed  and Cdkn1c(part of Kcnq1 cluster) further upstream to Igf2 and is a tumour suppressor is not expressed.<br />     Overexpression of oncogene and no expression of tumour suppressor gene results in genomic instability and overall growth promotion hence resulting in cancer. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">     Drugs which alter methylation of DNA can have long lasting effects which go beyond the drug treatment period. This can be achieved because DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark which is mitotically heritable in all subsequent daughter cells. Enzyme DNMT1 is responsible for the establishment and regulation of tissue specific patterns of methylation. It recognises hemi-methylated DNA and restores methylation of DNA in both strands. This helps produce two daughter cells which are identical to each other and to their mother cell. <br />     Epigenetic marks are reprogrammed twice during the life of an organism. These are known as <b>sensitive periods</b> in terms of epigenetic reprogramming. <b>First sensitive period</b> occurs during <strong>preimplantation phase</strong> of embryo between zygote to blastocyst phase and<b> second</b> <b>sensitive period</b> occurs during<strong> primordial germ cell development</strong> in midgestation embryo. As epigenetic marks are erased and reset during these two periods, treating patients with epigenetic drugs those alter the epigenome during these sensitive periods may disrupt normal reprogramming process. This can have possible detrimental effects for an organism. So it is<b> inadvisable</b> to treat patients with such epigenome altering drugs during these two sensitive periods.</div>
