    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value">In normal cells (non cancer cells) CpG islands found in promoter regions are hypomethylated (low methylation). If CpG islands are methylated in the promoter of some gene then the gene will be silenced (i.e. no expression). Thus CpG methylation is an inactivity
mark. On the other hand, in the cancer cells is often other way around - CpG islands in promoters are often hypermethylated. This means that cancer cell can inactivate tumor suppressor genes by CpG methylation in gene promoters. DNA methylation is mitotically
(cell division) heritable so it's is an effective way to keep tumor suppressors inactive. This epigenetic changes are often found in different cancer type. In the normal cell DNA is hypermethylated (high methylation) in repetitive elements and in intergenic
regions. Hypermethylation function here is to maintain genomic stability. In cancer cells often DNA is hypomethylated in repetitive elements and in intergenic regions. This hypomethylation introduces instability - for instance recombination between repeats,
misalign etc. just because this regions are not anymore properly packed in heterochromatin but exposed to other similar regions. Also hypomethylation may lead to activation of the repeats - they can make a copy of itself and transpose to another place
in genome. This leads to potential disruption of functionality of other genes (e.g. activation of an growth or oncogene gene).

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprinted genes are often involved in growth (promoting or supressing). In case of cancer you may find either hypermethylation or hypomethylation in different imprint control regions (depending if gene is suppressing or promoting the growth). In H19/Igf2
cluster example region in the normal cell is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal. When it is methylated (paternal) enhancer acts on lgf2 (expressed) and when it's unmethylated (maternal) enhancer acts H19 and lgf2 is silenced.
If it is also methylated on the maternal allele (cancer cell), maternal allele also expresses of lgf2 - now there is a double dose of lgf2 which is a growth promoter. This is the case in Wilm's tumor.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating (hypomethylation) agent. <br />Decitabine hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase thus prevents the methylation (additional source: <a title="Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decitabine" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decitabine">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decitabine</a>).<br />If CpG islands in promoter regions are hypermethilated (high methilation) then gene is silenced.<br />If gene is growth or tumor suppressor and if it's silenced then this change can promote the tumor (together with other DNA and/or epigenetic changes).   <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic marks (DNA methylation) are mitotically (cell division) heritable. Cancer cells divides rapidly and if there was an epigenetic change in methylation in the parent cell, that change will stay in daughter cell as well - that may keep even new cells susceptible to standard chemotherapy. So even when drugs that alter DNA methylation are not used anymore epigenetic changes will be present after each mitosis. There are particularly sensitive periods of development when using such drugs is not advisable. Sensitive periods are period of primordial germ cell development (production of eggs and sperm) and pre-implantation period and early post-implantation period (peri-conceptional period). During these periods it is active remodelling of the epigenetic marks (reprogramming): removal and establishing marks at different places in epigenome. If during this sensitive periods drugs that alter DNA methylation are used then the treatment may have serious negative health implications. This may be the case even if relatively small DNA methylation changes are induced (small number of genes).
