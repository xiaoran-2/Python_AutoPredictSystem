    <h1>Submission 49 from Anon (session_user_id: dd7a6f3d937b21d0becf554e4ae87fa3ff6ff3e9)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to a class of drugs called DNA-demethylating agents.  Their effect is to limit the methylation that occurs.  This can then have anti-tumor effects by a number of mechanisms. The key one is related to tumor suppressing genes.  Because methylation generally silences gene activity, one finding is that if normal tumor suppressing genes are over methylated, they become inactive or not expressed which allows unregulated expression and therefore tumor cell overgrowth.  By blocking this effect decitabine has been shown to be effective in diseases such as myelodysplastic syndrome.<br />Such drugs may also make subsequent chemotherapy more effective.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">CpG islands regulate gene expression with hypomethylation resulting in expression and hypermethylation resulting in suppression of nearby genes.  These are often situated by tumor suppressor genes and hence if the tumor suppressor is UNDER expressed, tumor growth will occur.  With aging or other accumulation of epigenetic changes, over time there is a clear trend to hypermethylation of these regions.  The result is that tumor suppressor genes become increasingly under-expressed and tumor growth accelerates as it is now unregulated.<br />In contrast to CpG islands, intergenic and repetitive regions are hypermethylated in normal tissue but hypomethylated in cancer cells.  Hypomethylation at repeats are particularly important as increased repeats can lead to abnormal chromosome recombinations, translocations, insertions, deletions and genomic instability. Increased repeats along with hypomethylation results in more euchromatin at the time of recombination and a greater chance of similar sequences which are then more likely to lead to recombination but improperly across chromosomes.  These mutations/genomic instability can lead to cancer formation.<br />In intergenic regions there can be CpG poor promotor regions, and if these become hypomethylated, oncogene expression is no longer occuring and the oncogene becomes over-expressed leading to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprinting normally acts to allow expression of only the paternal or maternal allele.  One example is the H19/Igf2 cluster.  For this, the enhancer region will normally act on Ifg2 to activate or express it unless there is hypomethylation of the ICR in which case H19 is activated and blocks the enhancer from promoting expression of Igf2.  The maternal allele imprinting results in hypomethylation and hence H19 blocks promotion of Igf2 whereas the paternal allele is hypermethylated and Ifgf2 is expressed.  In Wilms tumor, imprinting does not occur resulting in both alleles expressing Igf2.  Because Igf2 is a growth promoter the result is tissue proliferation leading to tumor growth.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic changes continue to act on cell lines as they are mitotically passed on. As a result, a change in DNA or histone methylation will affect not just the original cell but all daughter cells in that cell line.  As a result, if a drug changes DNA methylation, as described in the Economist article, these changes will be enduring in that cell line. This may continue to affect gene expression and may also change the susceptiblity of those cells to future chemotherapeutic agents.<br />A sensitive period is a time when epigenetic markers are usually stripped away before being replaced and occurs at the time of germ cell formation in the embryo and formation of male/female gametes.  Pluripotent cells are those whcih can evolve into different tissues depending on the epigenetic marks present and hence affecting epigenetics in pluripotent cells can alter their subsequent development.  Chemotherapy that alters epigenetic markers at sensitive times could be quite unsafe and unpredictable in its effects.  For example, during pregnancy, many pluripotent cells are differentiating into specific tissues based on epigenetic marks, and if these are disrupted, tissue formation may become deranged.  In addition, gametes may have inappropriate markers removed/replaced affecting future generations.</div>
