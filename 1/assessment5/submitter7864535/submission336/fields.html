    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell, CpG islands are hypomethylated, but repetitive elements, intergenic regions and the introns are methylated. However, in cancer cells there is hypermethylation at CpG islands and the rest of the genome is hypomethylated. These CpG islands are where promoters of tumour suppressor genes are found. Therefore, cancer cells inactivate this tumours suppressor genes. In other words, DNA methylation at CpG islands produce silencing of tumour suppressor genes. <br />On the other hand, as I said, intergenic regions and repetitive elements have high level of methylation at normal cells. But when we find a cancer cell, these regions are unmethylated. The consequence of this hypomethylation is the genomic instability. We can find illegitimate recombination between repeats, like reciprocal translocations between two different chromosomes. This occurs because the chromatin is open, so the recombination is easier to occur in cancer cells, which have this regions hypomethylated, than in normal cells, which have this regions heavily methylated and, therefore, they are more densely packaged. Also, we can detect the activation of repeats and transposition. This means that the repeats jump around the genome or transponse, and a consequent problem may be the disruption of the coding region of a gene, but it also might activate neighbouring genes. So, if we have strong promoters in this places, result can be aberrant for surrounding genes, because if you have deletions, and this promoters become active, you would have insertions in these chromosomes. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell, the imprint control region (ICR) is methylated on the paternal chromosome allele. This methylation prevents CTCF protein binding and, together with methylation at the H19 promoter, allows the enhancers to access Igf2. Therefore, Igf2 can be expressed. <br />On the maternal allele, the ICR is not methylated. This unmethylation allows CTCF (and its factors) to bind. This interaction mediates enhancer  blocking allowing downstream enhancers to access the H19 promoter. In this case it express H19.<br />But if we think in a cancer cell, we can find loss of imprinting. What happens is that there is hypermethylation in the ICR on the maternal allele too. So, Igf2 will be expressed in both alleles (paternal and maternal), and Igf2 is growth promoting, and this is associated with Wilm´s tumour. This is a particular childhood kidney tumour. <br />So, Wilm´s tumour is specific for the loss of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster. However, loss of imprinting is observed in a very wide array of tumour types. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a drug that belongs to DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi). Decitabine is incorporated into DNA upon replication. Therefore it is replication dependent. In other words, Decitabine doesn´t allow that DNA methyltransferase binds to DNA. So, DNMT won´t be able to copy the methylation to the daughter strand. This means that cancer cells, which divide much faster than most other cells in the body, will be more severity affected. <br />It is important to know that high doses of Decitabine have a toxic effect. So, in order to obtain a very good anti-neoplasic effect, we have to use lower doses. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation can be used to target in treatment because it can be manipulated, and enduring effects on the epigenome are ensured as the DNA  methyltransferase enzymes preserve methyl marks during mitosis. But, we have to considerate that this interventions may interfere with the epigenetic machinery, specially during sensitive periods, which are periods what are susceptible to changes in the environment. This changes can have a big effect in the epigenetic reprogramming. <br />During epigenetic reprogramming there are two waves where epigenetic marks are cleared. One in the early development and other in primordial gem cells development. This two periods are the sensitive periods. Therefore, these treatments would be inadvisable for the pregnant mothers, because, in this state, epigenetic reprogramming is happening. </div>
