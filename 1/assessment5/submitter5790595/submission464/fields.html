    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a heritable epigenetic mark involving covalent
transfer of a methyl group to C-5 position of cytosine ring of DNA by DNA
methyltransferases (DNMTs) with S-adenosyl-methionine
(SAM) as methyl donor <span>[2,3,5,
14].  The process is critical for normal
development, gene expression patterns and genomic stability [7]. </span></p>

<p>In healthy cells, CpG islands are
generally hypomethylated allowing an open chromatin structure. CpG islands are
generally protected against DNA methylation and therefore lack this
modification in normal cells, although exceptions. However, the CpG poor
regions found in repetitive elements within the intergenic and intronic regions
of the genome are methylated (hypermethylated) and thereby maintain a closed
chromatin structure. DNA methylation represents a defense mechanism against
selfish DNA elements, preserves the structural integrity of the genome by
“masking” repetitive sequences, and contributes to transcriptional repression
and gene silencing.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>In cancer and on the inactive X chromosome, many CpG islands
preceding tumor suppressor gene promoters often become hypermethylated, forcing
these regions into a closed chromatin structure. Therefore "normal"
CpG methylation profile is often inverted in cells that become cancerous. Abnormal
hypermethylation of CpG islands inactivates tumour suppressor genes such as
p16, p21, p27, and p53 seen in in many cancers thus failing to clear cancerous
cells, DNA repair proteins such as O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase
(MGMT), BRCA1; RAR-β2, an initiators of cell differentiation, maternally
imprinted pro-apoptotic gene, ARHI [4, 7]. </p>

<p>Hypomethylation often occurs in the repetitive elements,
intergenic regions and gene introns as well as the oncogene promoter regions
and parasitic repeat elements sequences. The demethylation of silenced tumor
suppressor genes may lead to re-expression, leading to cell-cycle inhibition
and apoptosis that allows cells programmed to die to live on [4]. Therefore DNA
methylation is an alternative to genetic mutations that are important in
silencing the tumor suppressor genes in cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic
imprinting is an epigenetic where certain genes are expressed in parent-of-origin. In chromosome 11p15.5,
two independently regulated clusters of imprinted genes IGF2
and H19 genes and
methylated imprinting control region (ICR) on one parental
allele occur. IGF2
encodes insulin-like growth factor 2, normally transcribed from paternal allele
while H19 is a long noncoding RNA transcribed from maternal that negatively regulates
body weight, cell proliferation and gene expression and in some cancers. ICR at
IGF2 and H19 is normally methylated on paternal allele and excluded on maternal
allele by CTCF binding insulation on ICR, blocking access of IGF2 promoters to enhancers
downstream of H19 gene. Hypermethylation of IC1 region causes increased
activity of IGF2 gene that promotes growth and loss of H19 gene activity in tissues.
Also deletion of maternal IC1 causes activation of normally silent maternal IGF2
allele and down-regulation of H19. In cancers, increased activities of
IGF2 gene occur thus stimulate growth of tumor cells and prevent damaged cells
from being destroyed by apoptosis. In Wilms tumors, transcriptionally silent
maternal IGF2 allele is activated such that IGF2 expression occurs
biallelically in association with loss of methylation at a DMR in IGF2. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine
is a nucleoside analogue that belongs to a class of DNA methyltransferase
inhibitors (DNMT Inhibitor) that inhibits DNA methylation by irreversibly
binding to DNNTs after they have been incorporated into DNA and therefore they
are replication dependent. Decitabine has the ability to deplete DNA
methyltransferase enzymes and to induce DNA demethylation (hypomethylation) and
epigenetic reprogramming. The antitumour effect has been linked to reactivation
of epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor genes induced by hypomethylation. It
is effective in hematological malignancies such as myelodysplastic syndrome
(MDS), a conditions in which the bone marrow produces deformed blood cells,
which is a precursor of acute myelogenous leukemia which are dependent on tumor
suppressor gene hypermethylation.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic drugs like combination of DNMT inhibitor and histone-deacetylases
inhibitors can alter tumor
cells in some lasting way and them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy. Epigenetic
changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells
until they are actively erased. Once erased don’t return and this forms basis where
epigenetic therapies can cause changes in DNA methylation leading to inhibition
of cancer cell growth without killing all cells. DNA methylation can be manipulated
once in cancer and long-term effects are ensured as DNA methyltransferase
enzymes preserve methyl marks during mitosis. Though, these drugs may interfere
with other body functions during sensitive period of extensive epigenetic
reprogramming. Sensitive period is when DNA methylation patterns are
particularly susceptible to reprogramming and mainly ranges from fecundation to
blastocyst pre-implantation and early germ line differentiation [14]. So use of
these drugs is contraindicated in women preparing to become pregnant, pregnant
mothers and children since a lot of reprogramming occurs in early child development
and during formation of gametes in both male and female. Since during this
period extensive reprograming is taking place that may be interfered with by drugs
thus affecting body cells, tissues and growth of individual.</p><p><br /></p>References<br />Not listed because of word limit<br /><br /></div>
