    <h1>Submission 305 from Anon (session_user_id: 874d188523dd3bb2e9115ba56f53b0c182c22286)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue and belongs to a class of drugs that inhibits the action of DNA methyltrasferase. It binds irreversibly to this enzyme preventing methylation of DNA during replication. As this will affect the subsequent generation(s) of cells without affecting the DNA sequence, this epigenetic therapy can have an anti-tumour effect. It is currently used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome that has progressed to acute myeloid leukaemia.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drug related alteration in DNA methylation states can have long lasting effects on the epigenome as the changes that occur are mitotically heritable and will be passed on to the next generation of cells even though the DNA is unchanged. Whilst this can be beneficial as evidenced by the improved sensitivity to chemotherapy, there may be deleterious effects on normal tissue, particularly if this occurs during sensitive periods of development. Sensitive periods are periods of development when the regulatory epigenetic marks are being cleared and laid down as might occur during the development of gametes/germ cells and during early embryo development. Changes occurring during this time will be carried on into the next generation and may have long lasting consequences. Any treatment during this time would be inadvisable.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are regulatory sites found near the promoter regions of genes. The DNA is typically not methylated in CpG islands. In cancers states, there is increased DNA methylation in the CpG islands. The hypermethylation of CpG islands in locus specific DNA results in the silencing of tumour suppressor genes. Loss of both copies of these genes can result in unregulated growth of tissue and the development of cancer.<br /><br />Normal methylation states in the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are required to ensure genomic stability. DNA in these regions are usually methylated in normal tissues but becomes hypomethylated in cancerous states thus giving rise to the possibility of illegitimate recombinations and transposition of chromosomes and disruption of genes.<div><em></em></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Loss of imprinting can result in the promotion of cancerous growth when there is either a loss of gene expression from both parental alleles or when there is double the expression from both parental alleles. In the H19/IGF2 cluster, the imprint control region in the paternal allele is methylated but the ICR in the maternal allele is not. This unmethylated maternal ICR allows binding of CTCF and enhancer action on H19 with its subsequent expression. As a result, IGF2 is not expressed. Due to the methylation of ICR in the paternal allele,  CTCF is unable to bind to it  and H19 expression is prevented. The enhancers then act upon the paternal IGF2, allowing it to be expressed.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumour, the both the paternal and maternal ICRs are methylated and there is a loss of imprinting. As a result, IGF2 expression occurs in both the maternal and paternal alleles resulting in double the dose of IGF2 expression. IGF2 is a growth factor and this contributes to the development of the cancer.</div>
