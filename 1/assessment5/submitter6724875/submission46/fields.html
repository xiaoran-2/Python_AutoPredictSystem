    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation occurs in mammals almost exclusively at cytosines that are followed by guanines (CpG dinucleotide). CpG islands are usually found in the promoters of genes. </p><p>DNA methylation is an inactive epigenetic mark since it does usually not occur at CpG islands. If methylation will be found at CpG islands, however, it can universally be seen as a synonymous with silencing of gene expression.</p><p>In cancer, DNA methylation globally decreases in the progress from a normal tissue to a metastatic tissue. At the same time, at some CpG islands, DNA methylation becomes more dense. </p><p>In a normal cell, there is a locus specific hypomethylation and a genomewide hypermethylation. In detail, the CpG islands usually tend to be hypomethylated, whereas the genome will generally be methylated at the repetitive elements, the intergenic regions, and the introns of genes. </p><p>In a cancer cell though, the reverse is the case; a locus specific hypermethylation and a genomewide hypomethylation appears. Then, the CpG islands will more likely appear to be methylated, whereas the rest of the genome will be generally hypomethylated at the repetitive elements, the intergenic regions, and the introns of genes. CpG hypermethylation occurs in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes.</p><p>









</p><p>Cancer cells can inactivate tumour suppressor genes either epigenetically by epimutations, such as hypermethylation, or genetically, by DNA mutations. Epigenetically modified hypermethylation typically occurs more frequently and it is mitotically heritable, but also reversible. Tumour suppressor genes are therefore actively and effectively silenced by DNA methylation. </p><p>

</p><p>Silencing the tumour suppressor genes allows the epimutated cells to have competitive advantage over all the other cells in the surrounding tissue. By time, they take over as they evolve an ability to divide more rapidly and to be prevented from cell death.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, sold as Dacogen, is an epigenetic anticancer drug that belongs to the family of drugs called DNA-methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTIs). </p><p>Tumour suppressor genes are usually transcriptionally silenced by DNA methylation. Since DNA hypermethylation is reversible, it can be actively maintained by the use of the hypomethylation agent Decitabine. Then, the drug would decreasingly act on the occurring hypermethylation and perform DNA demethylation by turning on the genes, which have epigenetically been silenced. </p><p>





</p><p>In a nutshell, a treatment by the use of Decitabine brings up the option to remove the methylation therapeutically and can therefore have a growth-inhibitory effect and anti-tumour effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer cells, genes that should be displaying monoallelic parent-of-origin specific expression, which means they are imprinted, commonly do not display this imprinted expression. Rather, they are either expressed from both parental alleles or they are silent from both parental alleles. </p>
<p>In the event of a hypermethylation of the imprint control region (ICR) of the H19/IGF2 cluster, the ICR is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele. In an unmethylated state, CTCF binds an insulator element and the enhancers then act on H19. IGF2 is not being expressed on the maternal allele, and therefore being silent. On the paternal allele, however, because of the fact there is methylation but CTCF is not binding to insulate it, the enhancers now act on IGF2. Thus, IGF2 is being expressed from the paternal allele.</p>
<p>On the flip side, with loss of imprinting a hypermethylation of the ICR is displayed on the maternal allele as well. As IGF2 is expressed from both, the paternal allele and the maternal allele, a double dose IGF2 will be expressed. This is associated with Wilm’s tumour. The disrupted imprinting lead to an overexpression of IGF2, which is a growth factor (insulin-like growth factor 2).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In contrast to gene regulation, such as transcription factors, the epigenetic state of a cell will be heritably passed on to daughter cells through cell division. Once a tumour has been successfully treated, this epigenetic state will then be epigenetically inherited through the next cell division as well. </p>
<p>Since different tumours have different dependencies, DNA methylation is basically context dependent. This means, a depletion of DNA methylation will suppress tumourgenesis in a tumour driven by tumour suppressor hypermethylation, whereas depletion of DNA methylation in a tumour driven by chromosomal instability will enhance tumourgenesis. </p>
<p>Consequently, these dependencies have implications for the effectiveness of epigenetic therapy in tumours; the effect of DNA methylation depletion can be stage specific and depending on the type of tumour should determine the appropriate time to treat a particular tumour, whether early or late in tumourgenesis. Treated at the the wrong time, it may be a terrible thing and might have quite the opposite effect.</p></div>
