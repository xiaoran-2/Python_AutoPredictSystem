    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cells, promotor CpG islands are generally unmethylated, whereas they can be hypermethylated in cancer cells.  This may result in abnormal silencing of tumour suppressor genes and subsequent cell immortalisation. In tumour cells, CpG island hypermethylation is frequent, mitotically heritable, variable between tumour type, progresses over time and correlates with tumour stage. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements in normal cells are generally hypermethylated, maintaing genomic stability, and the reciprocal is true in cancer cells. Abnormal hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repeats contributes to genomic instability through illegitimate recombination, transpositions, and oncogene promotor activation. This results in the loss of growth control, nuclear structure and dysorganisation seen in cancer cells.  </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Abnormal methylation of imprint control regions (ICR) leads to a loss of imprinting - or monoallelic parental gene expression- and can result in abnormally overexpressed or absent gene expression. For example, the growth promoting IGF2 gene is a paternally expressed gene in the absence of CTCF binding to the methylated paternal ICR. Conversely, unmethylated maternal ICR binds CTCF preventing enhancer activation of IGF2 and the preferential expression of H19. In Wilm's tumour, a paediatric renal tumour, both maternal and paternal ICR is methylated (an imprinting disorder) and growth-promoting IGF2 is overexpressed leading to  tumourigenesis.    </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitarabine is a DNMT1 inhibitor, a class of epigentic inhibitors which are nucleoside analogues that irreversibly bind DNMT1, preventing its role in DNA methylation maintenance. This possibly has an anti-tumour effect through preventing hypermethylation and silencing of tumour suppressor genes, particularly in CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) tumours such as colorectal cancer, glioma, neuroblastoma, and certain haematopoietic malignancies amongst others. This may disinhibit the expression of programmed cell death genes (apoptosis), DNA repair enzyme expression, and cell cycle regulatory protein expression that may be aberrant in cancer cells. It is also possible that they function through the prevention of hypermethylation and loss of imprinting at imprint control regions, preventing overexpression of growth promoting genes or oncogenes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic changes are, by definition, mitotically heritable. Therefore altering DNA methylation will have an effect on the epigenetic status of that cell and as well as its progeny. This may have a more enduring effect than the single generation cytotoxicity of standard chemotherapy. A sensitive period is one in which changes to the epigenetic features of a cell are subject to environmental change. Sensitive periods occur in the early embryonic period and during germ cell development. Exposing patients to agents which may have an enduring effect on the epigenome - such as DNA methylation modifying drugs - during sensitive periods may have systemically broader consequences than the tumour-specific control intended.   </div>
