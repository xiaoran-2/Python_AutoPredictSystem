    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">The methylation of CpG islands are associated with the formation of repressive chromatin structure and can also inhibit the binding of transcription factors and alter gene expression. Normal cells have unmethylated CpG islands while cancer cells have hypermethylation in promoters of  tumor suppressor genes that leads to silencing of tumor suppressor genes, being a good mechanism since DNA methylation  is heritable mitotically by DNMT1.<br />The repetitive elements and intergenic regions are normally methylated  to maintain genomic stability, while cancer cells in these regions are unmethylated. The hypometilacion of these genomic regions cause genomic Instability as:<br /> -Illegitimate recombination between repeats since chromosomes are not being packaged into heterochromatin by the loss of methylation<br />-activation of repeats and transposition <br />-activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to
neighbouring genes. <br />This hypomethylation happens early and progress with time and ocurre mas frecuentemente en repeats<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In cancer the disruption of imprinting occurs because mostly  these genes that are imprinted are involved in growth, like is the case of H19/Igf2 cluster <span>where the </span>IGF2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called insulin-like growth factor  and <span> H19 has a role in the negative regulation of body weight and c</span>ell profileration. The methylation pattern of H19/Igf2 cluster is:<br />Maternal pattern: the ICR is unmethylated and CTCF binds to insulator element and enhancer will act in H19 and Igf2 is silent in this maternal allele.<br />Patternal allele: the ICR is methylated and CTCF cant binds to insulator element and enhancer will act in Igf2.<br />In Wilm’s tumour the ICRs is methylated in the maternal allele an din this case you have expression of Igf2 gene from the paternal allele and the maternal allele, this causes an over-expression of this gene and as stated IGF2 is a growth promoter gene ans this disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster <span>contributes to cancer.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. Decitabine is a  cytosine analogues and have been shown to inhibit DNMT.<br />A paciente with cancer that have hipermethylation of DNA can recive this drug that inhibit DNMT and this resuls in hypomethylation of the DNA and re-expression of tumor suppressor gene having an anti tumor effect.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that altered DNA methylation can enduring effects since the DNA methyltransferase
enzymes preserve methyl marks during mitosis. <br />Exist sensitive periods when altered environments have an effect on epigenetic control and this periods are the period of primordial germ cell development all the way through to the production of mature eggs and sperm and the second period is  the pre-implantation and early post- implantation period where are active remodelling of epigenome. Treating patientes in this period can cause alteration that affect early child development and formation of gametes.<br /><br /><br /></div>
