    <div class="field-value">The normal function of DNA
      methylation at CpG islands is to contribute to the silencing of key genetic
      regions and the maintenance of the structural integrity of the genome.
      These normal roles of DNA methylation of CpG islands lead to essential
      epigenetic regulation of the genome including imprinting, X chromosome
      inactivation and the formation of heterochromain.<span> Several mechanisms for how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer have been described such as stochastic
alterations that are perpetuated by selective pressure and alterations in
epigenetic machinery.  DNA methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer by hypomethylation genome-wide, particularly at intergenic regions and repetitive elements, and also by region specific hypermethylation of promoter regions and their island shores of tumor suppressor genes.  DNA methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements maintains the genomic integrity of the region by silencing transcription of these regions. DNA methylation of repetitive regions also protects the genome from transposable elements. DNA methylation in intergenic region and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer via hypomethylation.  The hypomethylation of these regions leads to genomic instability allowing for illegitmate recombination between repeats, for the activation of repeats, transposition, cryptic promoters and disruption of neighbouring genes.<br /></span> <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normally, the paternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated at at an imprint control region (ICR) that suppreses of the expression of H19 and allows for the expression of Igf2. Whereas the maternal allele of the ICR in the H19/Igf2 is unmethylated which allows for both the expression of H19 and the binding of CTCF within the ICR generating an insulator that prevents the expression of Igf2.  In Wilm’s tumour, imprinting is disrupted at the H19/If2 cluster by the methylation H19 in both the maternal and paternal alleles. Disrupting the imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer by allowing for the overexpression of Igf2. Igf2 is growth promoting and leads to the development of Wilm's tumour.<br /><br />Reference:<br /><span>Abramowitz, L. K. &amp; Bartolomei, M. S. Genomic imprinting:

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the class of inhibitors that inhibit DNA methyltransferases (DNMT).  This drug inhibits DNMT thereby leading to the demethylation of DNA because when cells replicate the machinery necessary for maintaining the mitotic heritability of DNA methylation is impaired. Decitabine can have anti-tumour effect on cancerous tissue with methylated tumour suppressor genes because treatment with Decitabine leads to the demethylation of DNA by reducing the availability of DNMT.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs can alter DNA methylation in cancer cells and this is mitotically heritable meaning when the cancer cells replicate the methylation patterns that have been altered are propagated. A drug that is beneficial against cancer may alter DNA methylation leading to the expression of tumor suppressor genes or reduce the expression of oncogenes. A sensitive period is a period in which the establishment of epigenetic marks takes place such as gametiogenesis and primordial germ cell programming. Treating patients, particularly younger patients, during sensitive periods is inadvisable as it can induce epigenetic genes that are passed on to the gametes affecting future generations and throughout the entire organisms during primordial cell reprogramming. Treatment during these periods impose a great risk of inducing epigenetic changes with unnecessary side effects.<br /><br /><br /><br />General Assignment Reference:<br /><br />1.
