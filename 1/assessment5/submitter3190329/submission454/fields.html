    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation at
CpG islands is one of the specific epigenetic modifications occurring in DNA. They
are commonly found at the promoters of genes. CpG islands are normally
protected from methylation but when they are methylated the gene is silenced.
The methylation status of a gene may be different at different times or
tissues. In a cancer cell however, the CpG islands are more likely to be
methylated. This phenomenon is called CpG island hypermethylation and it is
responsible for the silencing of tumor suppressor genes in cancer. This
hypermethylation is common in tumors and since it is mitotically heritable it
is an effective way of silencing a tumor suppressor gene. When these genes are
silenced the cells will divide more rapidly and/or survive more allowing tumor
growth. </p>

<p>On the contrary,
in normal cells the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are generally
methylated. The function of DNA methylation at these sites is to maintain
stability (prevent transposition, avoid transcriptional interference, etc.). In
cancer cells, most of the genome including intergenic regions and repetitive
elements are hypomethylated. More importantly, the genome-wide hypomethylation
found in cancer cells occurs mostly at the repeats. The consequence of this
hypomethylation is the reduction of genome stability and thus, the occurrence
of illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and
transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring
genes. Gene activation can lead to the expression of protooncogenes and/or
expression of microRNAs that target (and inactivate or silence) tumor
suppressor genes. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alterations of DNA methylation at
imprinting control regions can lead to loss of imprinting. So, the gene will be
expressed in both parental alleles or not expressed at all. For instance, in the
H19/Igf2 cluster the imprinting control region is methylated in the paternal
allele preventing the binding of the CTCF insulator protein and thus,
downstream enhancers act on Igf2 allowing its expression. Also, there is
spreading of methylation from the imprinting control region to H19 contributing
to the inhibition of its expression. </p>

<p>On the maternal allele however, the
imprinting control region is not methylated and therefore, the CTCF protein
binds to this region insulating Igf2. In this case, the enhancers act on H19 allowing
its expression but silencing Igf2. </p>

<p>With loss of imprinting in cancer cells,
both alleles are methylated at the imprinting control regions and thus, Igf2
will be paternally and maternally expressed. This will happen because CTCF
insulator element will not bind to the imprinting control region and the
enhancers will act on Igf2 and not on H19. That way there will be a double dose
of Igf2 and since this gene is a growth promoter, this phenomenon leads to Wilm’s
tumor. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating
agent or DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. Despite the fact that cancer cells genome
is hypomethylated there are places where there is hypermethylation such as in
CpG islands as discussed in the first question. There can be also a
hypermethylation of histone proteins. In both cases, tumor suppressor genes can
be silenced and thus, they will not be able to stop the cell uncontrolled
growth that leads to cancer. Decitabine might contribute to solve this problem
through DNA-demethylation. This epigenetic change, reactivation of tumor suppressor
genes for instance, will pass on during cell division to daughter cells. This
means that eventually, the hypermethylation will be erased allowing the cells
to return to their controlled state of cell division and this would be the
anti-tumor effect of Decitabine.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation help to
reverse the epigenetic abnormalities common in cancer cells. These epigenetic alterations
are mitotically inherited so they can spread to daughter cells and therefore
have enduring effects. So, there are sensitive periods of epigenetic reprogramming
in which these drugs might need to be avoided. Sensitive periods of development
would be during pregnancy when the fetus is growing and also in young people
where germ cells are still being developed. The wary in this kind of treatment
is that alteration of epigenetic marks can happen in a generalized way in
potentially all cell types. The unknown answer is what kind of enduring effects
they will be and this is why treating patients during sensitive
periods would be inadvisable.</p>
