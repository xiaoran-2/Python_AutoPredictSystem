    <div class="field-value"><p>1. </p>

<p>DNA methylation can be
increased or decreased in cancer.  The
changes can be local or genome wide.  Typically
increased DNA methylation will decrease
expression of genes, of particular importance here for tumor suppressor genes.  Decreased DNA
methylation could activate proto-oncogenes, and increase genomic instability in
general, which is characteristic of many cancers.</p>

<p>a. Methylation at CpG islands, especially at promoters,
generally would decrease expression of those genes.</p>

<p>b. In many cancers, methylation of CpG islands is increased.</p>

<p>c. This increase contributes to cancer when related to tumor
suppressor genes.  Tumor suppressor genes
normally would inhibit the abnormal cellular growth characteristic of
cancer.  Methylation of CpG islands in
tumor suppressor promoters would decrease the expression of these tumor
suppressor genes such as <i>RB, MLH1, BRCA1</i>,
and <i>MGMT</i>.  This decrease could lead to increased cell
division and a cancerous tumor.  This is
found in many colorectal cancers, gliomas, neuroblastomas, and others.</p>

<p>d. Genome wide methylation, in particular intragenic regions
and repetitive elements, normally functions to repress expression from those
regions, and may help stabilize those areas, keep the transposon-like elements
from moving to an actively transcribed region.</p>

<p>e. In some cancers, these intragenic regions are
hypomethylated.</p>

<p>f. The
hypomethylation of intragenic regions can contribute to cancer by generally increasing
genomic instability: increasing recombinations and rearrangement, and by
potentially increasing expression from CpG poor promoters: especially a concern
of the gene is a proto-oncogene; and increasing expression from cryptic
promoters, having new genes, or different dosages of genes expressed.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>2.  disruption of
imprinting; H19/Ifg2</p>

<p>a. The paternal allele is expressed.  The methylated ICE sequence cannot bind
CTCF.  The methylation continues to the
H19 locus, causing no expression of H19. 
As a result, the enhancers for <i>Igf2
</i>and <i>Ins2</i> are active and so those
genes are expressed.</p>

<p>b. The maternal allele is not expressed.  CTCF blocks the unmethylated ICE sequence,
and H19 remains unmethylated.  H19 is
expressed and blocks the enhancers for <i>Igf2
</i>and <i> Ins2</i> so that those genes are not
expressed.</p>

<p>c. Wilm’s tumor is a loss of the imprint on the maternal
allele.  The maternal H19 locus becomes
methylated, which would result in expression of <i>Igf2</i> by the paternal mechanism listed above: the enhancers for <i>Igf2</i> are active so the <i>Igf2</i> gene is expressed.</p>

<p>d. Overexpression of <i>Igf2</i>
is a characteristic of some cancers.  One
cause could be improper methylation of the maternal allele, allowing the CTCF
binding and expression of the maternal allele in addition to the paternal
allele.  This would be an example of too
high a dosage.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>a. Decitabine, or Dacogen, is a DNA-demethylating
agent, meaning it removes methyl groups from the DNA.</p>

<p>b. Therefore the net effect of decitabine should be to
decrease methylation of DNA, or maybe more
appropriate to cancer, counteract the hypermethylation of promoters (at CpG
islands) found in many cancers (Hassler and Egger, 2012) and at many tumor
suppressor genes, such as <i>RB, MLH1, BRCA1</i>,
and <i>MGMT</i>.</p>

<span>c. Decitabine then can have an anti-tumor effect by
decreasing the methylation of these promoters, allowing increased expression of
the tumor suppressor genes.  The
increased expression of these genes should have an anti-tumor effect</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>a. Altering DNA
methylation may have enduring effects on the genome because once the methyl
group is added or removed, it is very difficult to change it again;
in other words, that epigenetic change, is heritable, and present in all cells derived from that original
cell.  As suggested by studies in the
article from <u>The Economist</u>, manipulating methylation and/or histone
marks could treat the cancer itself, probably by changing gene expression,
or by making the cancer more susceptible to later chemotherapy.</p>

<p>b. A sensitive period is a time when in development usually, where the epigenome: DNA
methylation, other marks, can be reprogrammed or modified.</p>

<p>c. In normal development the sensitive periods are in early
embryological development: 1. at the blastocyst stage, before the formation of
the germ layers; 2. in the primordial germ cells. </p>

<p>d. It would be inadvisable to treat with epigenetic agents
during those sensitive times because then the erasure and resetting of marks
could be incorrect.   Genes that are
imprinted would be especially affected. 
In the drugs hinted at in <u>The Economist</u> article, a DNA
demethylating agent could cause an imprinted gene to be methylated less, which
would weaken the imprint, causing perhaps abnormal increase in expression.</p></div>
