    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands normally occur in instances where
gene silencing is required such as when maintaining X chromosome inactivation
or during genomic imprinting.</p>

<p><span>In cancer cells, the methylation status of CpG islands varies
from normal so that genetic activity is altered.  For instance, hypermethylation of CpG islands
in the promoter of tumour suppressor genes cause silencing of these regulatory
genes, leading to loss-of-function, affecting tumour prevention and promoting
cancer.</span></p>

<p><span>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements maintains
normal splicing mechanisms by silencing regions between genes and repetitive
regions.  Hence, it prevents changes to
gene expression by altered splicing. 
Hypomethylation in such regions result in active transposable elements
causing genomic instability.  Active
transposable elements can result in the transcription of genes usually
maintained silent.  Cancer progression
occurs when the transcription of tumour suppressor genes or oncongenes are
altered.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The <i>H19–IGF2</i> cluster consists of the paternally
expressed <i>insulin-like growth
factor 2</i> (<i>IGF2</i>) gene
and maternally expressed <i>H19</i> lncRNA.  IGF2 is a growth factor, important for
embryonic development and <i>H19</i> acts as a tumor suppressor.  This cluster contains an imprint control
region (ICR) which is methylated on the paternal allele.  Both genes share enhancers and the imprinting
in this cluster is driven by a CTCF-dependent insulator.  Methylation at the ICR in the paternal allele
prevents CTCF from binding thus allowing IGF2 to interact with the enhancers.  Methylation at the ICR also means methylation
of the H19 promoter hence silencing of the H19 transcription.  </span><span>In the maternal allele, CTCF bonds to the unmethylated ICR, preventing
interaction between the enhancers and IGF2 promoter.  Therefore, IGF2 expression is promoted on the
paternal allele and suppressed on the maternal allele.  In tumours driven by loss of imprinting, the
maternal chromosome looks like the paternal one with methylation of the H19
promoter; IGF2 is transcribed and tumour suppressor gene H19 is turned off and
causes increased cell proliferation. 
Wilms tumour occurs when there is suppression of the tumour suppressor
H19.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Decitabine acts as a hypomethylating agent by inhibiting the enzyme DNA
methyltransferase.  Decitabine thus
reduces the effect of DNA methylation.  Cancers
are associated with changes to the epigenome such as increased or reduces
levels of DNA methylation.  Decitabine
can be inserted in DNA and inhibit the process of DNA methylation by DNA
methyltransferase.  Increased methylation
of CpG islands in the promoter of tumour suppressor genes cause silencing of
the gene transcription and reduced activity of the tumour suppressors.  This ultimately promotes cell growth and proliferation.  Decitabine counteracts this process by
inhibiting further methylation by DNA methyltransferase thus having an
anti-tumour effect.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Sensitive period is when DNA methylation is reprogrammed.  It occurs naturally during gametogenesis and
early development and when producing induced pluripotent stem cells by
reprogramming somatic cells.  The altered
DNA methylation induced by the epigenetic drugs are passed on to several cell
generations prompting the effects of the altered DNA methylation (for example,
restored tumour suppressor activity) to last for longer than the treatment
period.  It would not be advised to treat
patients with such drugs during the sensitive periods to prevent changes to the
epigenome during the reprogramming period.</span></p></div>
