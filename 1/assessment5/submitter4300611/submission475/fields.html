    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p></p><ul><li>In a normal cell there is tends to be no DNA methylation at CpG islands, they are hypomethylated.  However the repetitive elements,
intergenic regions, &amp; introns of the gene over all are methylated.<br /></li><li> In cancer (overall) the reverse of a normal cell is true.  CpG islands are hypermethylated, and the repetitive elements intergenic regions, &amp; introns are not methylated.<br /></li><li>Where CpG islands are concerned being hypermethylated tends not to be a good thing, since methylation of CpG islands leads to silencing.  Which can lead to tumour suppressing genes being silenced, this in turn allows a cell to divide more rapidly and grow into a tumour.</li><li>For the intergenic regions and repetictive elemens hypermethylation is the normal state and is associated with overall genomic stability.  In cancer these regions are hypomethylated, which causes genomic instability, due to copying errors e.g. deltions, insertions, &amp; reciprocal translocations in chromosomes.</li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Paternal allele methylation pattern - imprint control region is methylated and is thus paternally imprinted (thus CTCF can't bind to it).  The enhancers promote thus Igf2.  And Igf2 is only expressed from the paternal allele.  H19 is not active on the paternal allele because the DNA methylation from the imprint control region carried over to the H19 region.</li><li>Maternal allele methylation pattern- the imprint control region is un-methylated (bound by an insulator protein CTCF).  CTCF insulates Igf2 from the downstream enhancers.  This then frees up the enhancers to enhance H19 the lnRNA only expressed on the maternal allele.  Thought that the 1st preference of the enhancers is Igf2, but because CTCF blocks this, they go to their 2nd preference H19.</li><li>Children with Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome often end up suffering from Wilm's kidney tumour as well.  Due to a mutation/deletion, uniparetnal disomy, or epigenetic disruption you effectively have 2 copies of the paternal allele.  To much Igf2 (tumour growth promoter, and no H19) is produced and no Cdkn1c (tumour inhibitor) is produced.  Overall growth promotion/loss of imprinting is a common feature of cancer overall and Wilm's tumour (kidney).</li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Decitabine belongs to the class of epigenetic inhibitors called DNMTi (DNA methyltransferase inhibitors).<br /></li><li>Decitabine de-methylates DNA, it is a nuceloside analogue.  Decitabine is incorporated into the DNA during replication, DNMT is unable to copy the methylation to the daughter strand because, once the Decitabine was incorporated into the DNA it irreversibly bond the DNMTs thus making it impossible for the methylation to be passed on to the daughter strand.  Unfortunately for the DNMTi's to work division has to occur.<br /></li><li>If used at a low enough dose Decitabine is a pretty good DNA demethylator which results in tumour cell death.  Since in myloplastic syndromes CpG islands are hypermethylated when they should be hypomethylated, Decitabine is able to de-methylate the CpG islands again.  In particular epigenetically silenced tumour suppressing genes are reactivated due the resulting hypomethylation effect of Decitabine.</li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, which means that when the cell divides the DNA methylation will be passed down to the daughter cells.  Thus a treatment only has to target/effect DNA methylation once to have a lasting effect.  Unfortunately treatments targeting DNA methylation have a rather global affect on the system, which might interfere with normal system function, this is especially concerning for individuals who might receive the treatment during a critical period. A critical period is a stage when extensive epigenetic reprogramming occurs. Critical periods that would be important to avoid such treatments would be early childhood (since a lot of reprogramming goes on during this period and the formation of the gametes), pregnancy, and about 3 months before conception occurs.  The effects such treatments would have on individuals is not known at this time.</li></ul></div>
