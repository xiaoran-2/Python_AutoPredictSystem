    <div class="field-value">CpG islands in typical cells are normally unmethylated.  Because they are found mostly in promoter regions, their activation or inactivation controls the transcription and expression of the genes that follow.  However, CGIs are hypermethylated in cancer cells, as are CGI shores.  Because CGIs normally are common in the promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes, their methylation silences the expression of these genes, impairing one of the cell's natural mechanisms of self-regulation against uncontrolled proliferation.  Whether this methylation is an initial cause or effect of the cancer appears to differ by case but CGI methylation is a common contribution to many cancers.<br />CpGs in Intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be methylated in a typical cell, possibly as a mechanism to mantain genomic integrity by preventing insertions, deletions and translocations and by preventing transcriptional interference.  These regions are hypomethylated in cancer, resulting in this genomic instability through illigitimate recombination of repeats, undesirable activation of repeats, transposons, and promotors, and disruption of neighboring genes.  Therefore, this epigenetic abnormality can contribute to genetic mutations that proliferate cancer.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The imprint control region of the H19/Igf2 cluster is normally methylated  on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele.  The methylation of the paternal allele prevents CTCF binding and allows enhancers to act on and activate the Igf2 gene while the H19 gene is silenced.  The unmethylated maternal ICR is bound by CTCF, which insulates and silences Igf2 and allows enhancers to act on the active H19 gene.  People with Wilms tumor have a mutation that causes a loss of imprinting thorugh to hypermethylation at the imprint control region, meaning Igf2 is expressed and H19 is silenced on both the maternal and paternal alleles.  Because Igf2 is growth promoting, its over expression as a result of failed imprinting, is related to an increased likelihood of developing childhood kidney cancer, a hallmark of Wilm's.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent (DNMT inhibitor).  Although the exact mechanism of action is still unknown, drugs like Decitabine irriversibly bind DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) to prevent the mitotic heritability of existing epigenetic marks.  These drugs work as nucleoside analogues that get incorporated into the DNA to halt the progress of DNMT which is why the mechanism is replication-dependent.  While this drug is not cell type-specific and may have long-term effects on typical cells, the rapid rate of devision for tumour cells, means tumour cells are  demethylated at a disproportionate rate, helping to slow the tumour's growth.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altered DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, which means it is passed down to future cells when the altered cell divides.  Therefore, drug or environmentally induced changes to the epiginome can persist and affect a person's response to other factors even after the initial exposure has seized.  For most of our development, the epigenetic marks in our genome remain relatively constant.  A sensitive period is when these marks are removed and relaid (reprogramming); this takes place during early embryonic development and primordial germ cell development.  Less pronounced sensitive periods also include differentiation of different tissues from stem cells.  Treating patients during these periods, such as treating pregnant women whose embryos would be exposed during germ cell development (and, to a lesser extent, treating children whose germ line cells are still developing)  could disrupt this reprogramming process and have pronounced effects on the epigenetic state of many of their cells.<br /></div>
