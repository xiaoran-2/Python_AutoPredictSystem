    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are normally umethylated strands of DNA, and act as promoters of genes.  In cancer, CpG islands can become methylated, silencing genes that are normally expressed, such as tumor supressor genes. Methylation of CpG islands sometimes leads to hypermethylation which can spread to other regions around the island, causing silencing of genes nearby (or any gene that's promoted by the region that becomes silenced).  Intergenic regions and repetitive elements, which are methylated in normal cells can become hypomethylated in cancer, which opens the genome to promoting expression of genes that are not normally expressed such as tumor proliferating genes.  Hypomethyation can also lead to recombination in regions that normally are protected, leading to insertions of transposons or DNA swapping between chromosomes. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent.  It can have an anti-tumor effect by demethylating CpG islands or any part of the genome that is hypermethylated, if given at the right doses, which can allow for expression of genes that have become silenced in cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Patterns of DNA methlylation, such as at centromeres, in X-inactivation, CpG island methylation, and parental imprinting are inherited over the lifetime of a cell and through cell division.  Drugs that alter DNA methylation can therefore have lasting effects since the altered methylation patterns will be copied throughout future cell division once the drug has taken effect.  When used at the right time, these drugs can be highly effective and allow for better treatment outcomes in patients with cancers that are caused in part by epigenetic changes to their DNA meythylation, such as acute myeloblastic leukemias.<a title="Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_myelomonocytic_leukemia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_myelomonocytic_leukemia"></a> There are sensitive periods, however, when DNA methylation is reset.  Sensitive periods tend to fall early in embryonic development when X-inactivation is occurring, and when gametes are being produced when parental imprinting is being rest.  Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have detrimental effects during these sensitive periods as they can either cause hyper- or hypomethylation in regions that depend on a finely tuned balance of methylation, causing inviable offspring, death of the embryo, or new cancers due to parts of the genome being accessible (or inaccessible) that usually are highly regulated, allowing for recombination or over or under expression of affected genes.<br /><br />reference: Video-lectures<br /><br /></div>
