    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value">Normally, the DNA at CpG islands is unmethylated. In cancer, CpG islands are more methylated. With this heightened methylation at CpG islands, tumor suppressor genes are more likely to be silenced. This allows tumors to grow more easily and can thus result in cancer. Regarding intergenic regions and repetitive elements, these tend to be more methylated in normal cells but unmethylated in cancer cells. The hypomethylation seen in cancer at these sites causes genomic instability (such as deletions, reciprocal translocations, and insertions).</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">At the H19/Igf2 cluster, the paternal allele normally has a methylated imprint control region and H19 promoter. This means that CTCF cannot bind the imprint control region, and thus the downstream enhancers are able to increase expression of Igf2. The maternal allele, on the other hand, has an unmethylated ICR and H19 promoter. This allows CTCF to bind to the ICR, which blocks the enhancers from amplifying Igf2 expression, and instead H19 is expressed. In Wilm's tumor, both of the alleles have a hypermethylated ICR. This means both alleles act like the paternal allele, so twice as much Igf2 is expressed, resulting in aberrant growth. This growth then leads to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, or DNMTi. Decitabine irreversibly binds DNMTs. This means that it does not allow for the preservation of DNA methylation in the genome in dividing cells. In blood cancers, tumor suppressors tend to be hypermethylated. Thus, not allowing methylation marks to be preserved in daughter strands of DNA (by inhibiting DNMTs) allows for tumor suppressor expression, which has an anti-tumor effect.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation, are mitotically heritable. This means that every dividing cell gives its respective epigenetic marks to the next generation of daughter cells. Thus, altering DNA methylation can have long-lasting effects through this heritability. However, the case is different in sensitive periods. A sensitive period is when epigenetic marks are actively erased and re-established. Sensitive periods in mammalian development occur during primordial germ cell development and pre-implanatation/early development. Treatment during these periods, for example treating a mother who is carrying a fetus in either early development or in its primordial germ cell development, would be inadvisable because it might alter the epigenome of the fetus permanently. For instance, if the mother were being given a DNMTi, the fetus's regular DNA methylation pattern may be disrupted and cause genomic instability through hypomethylation of repeats and intergenic regions.</div>
