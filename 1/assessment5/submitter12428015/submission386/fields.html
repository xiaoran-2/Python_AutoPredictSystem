    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG
islands results in gene silencing. Normally, CpG islands are largely
unmethylated, or hypomethylated. However, in the instance of cancer, the DNA
methylation of CpG islands is significantly increased, also called
hypermethylation. This results in silencing in the CpG island, increasing the
instance of cancer if found in multiple cells.</p>

<p>In intergenic regions and repetitive elements, the  DNA is largely methylated, resulting in
silencing of these regions. If these become disrupted through hypomethylation,
the silencing is disrupted. ie. The intergenic regions and repetitive
elements become expressed. This is a particular issue in imprinting, where
during transcription, the imprinting is lost. This allows the cancer to
replicate itself faster as transcription errors can become more prevalent if
the repetitive elements are not silenced.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>If the imprinted control region (ICR) is methylated
on the paternal allele, it stops the binding of CTCF. Without this binding, methylation
spreads to the H19 promoter causing silencing. This then allows enhancers to
access Igf2 to activate it.</p>

<p>If the ICR is unmethylated on the maternal allele,
it is bound by CTCF, which is an insulator protein, via H19. This stops the
access of enhancers to Igf2 and effectively silencing Igf2. This leaves the enhancers
free to work on H19.</p>

<p>Maternal mutation creates affected offspring whilst
paternal mutations will only produce carrier children. As cells are replicated,
deletion or inappropriate silencing is passed down to offspring.</p>

<p><span>In Wilm’s tumour, the loss of imprinting of  Igf2 silencing means that the Igf2 oncogene is
switched on and it promotes growth. Likewise in cancer, the imprinting
disruption allows the oncogene Igf2 to switch on, leading to the overgrowth of
cells, which allows cancer cells to keep replicating rapidly.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer cells
show a significant reversal of the normal methylated state of the DNA in the cells
it has invaded. If the section of DNA is normally methylated, cancer cells will
have the same section unmethylated. Likewise, normally unmethylated sections
are methylated in the cancer cells. Unlike other forms of mutations, epigenomic
mutations are more readily reversible. Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating
agent, which means it can reverse the hypermethylated state of DNA in some
cancers.  When combined with a histone-deactylase inhibitor, DNA
demethylating agents were found to slow growth of tumours in some advanced lung
cancer patients. The Cancer’s epicentre article in “The Economist”, states
that “Dr Baylin speculates that his epigenetic drugs altered the tumour cells
in some lasting way that made them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy”.</p>

<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA Methylation  alterations can be passed on though cell
replication if they occur in imprinted sections or occur during the highly
sensitive periods of development. The sensitive periods are when cells are
particularly susceptible to alterations within the DNA. During gestation, the
blastocyst and primordial germ cell stages are particularly sensitive. After
birth, there are a number of other sensitive periods, which primarily occur
during periods of increased growth and development.</p>

<p>Treating patients during these sensitive
periods would inadvisable as the treatments may have more adverse effect for
the long term during these times. Treatments can disrupt imprinted methylation
or cause transcription errors such as insert or deletion of repetitive portions
of DNA.</p>
