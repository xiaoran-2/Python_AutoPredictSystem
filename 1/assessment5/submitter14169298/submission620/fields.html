    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation is the
addition of methyl groups from S-adenosylmethionines to the 5’ end of cytosines
by DNA Methyltransferases in mammals 1. It occurs CpG islands
dinucleotides, intergenic regions and repetitive elements 1.</span><span>Most DNA methylation occurs at
CpG dinucleotides to suppress gene expression 2. DNA methylation at
CpG islands occur through two mechanisms. The first one is that, after
methylation at CpG islands, methylated CpG binds to CpG binding proteins such
as MeCP1 and MecP2, to recruit factors that make chromatin compact, thus preventing
gene expression 2. The second mechanism is that methylated CpGs block
promoters at which transcription activating factors bind 2.</span><span>Disruptions in DNA
methylation, such as excessive DNA methylation at CpG islands and CpG island
shores of tumour suppressor genes, causes cancer 3. The function of
tumour suppressor genes being the control of cell cycle, apoptosis and DNA
repair, their inactivation leads to uncontrolled cell growth - one of the
hallmarks of cancer 2, 3 .Hypermethylation of single tumour
suppressor genes can cause cancer; hypermethylation of BCRA1 causes breast
cancer 3. </span><span>At intergenic regions and at
repetitive elements, DNA methylation maintains genome stability 4.  DNA methylation at intergenic regions switches
off cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites 4. DNA
methylation at repetitive elements occurs through silencing of repetitive
elements to prevent transposition, illegitimate recombination and interferences
between strong promoters during transcription 1, 4. Lack of DNA
methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements of pro-metastatic
genes cause cancer because hypomethylation enables expression of oncogenes and
disruption of neighbouring genes 3, 4.  Genomic instability also occurs through
illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and
transposition and activation of cryptic promoters and disruptions of cryptic
promoters 4 . In a recent article, Szyf (2012), reported how the
hypomethylation of the pro-metastatic gene MMP2 lead to liver cancer 3.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>IgF2
is an insulin-like growth factor which is an imprinted gene. The gene  is expressed only from the paternal allele. Imprinting
starts during the formation of gametes – the gene is marked through DNA
methylation of its promoter. In the maternal copy of the gene, the  promoter is unmethylation and there is
transcription of the sense strand to produce IgF2.  In the paternal copy of the gene, the promoter
is methylated and inactive. There is a downstream promoter which unmethylated –
this therefore silences the IgF2 gene. Epigenetic alterations such as loss of
imprinting or overexpression at its locus; 11p15, lead to Wilm’s cancer.
Sometimes genes are expressed in cancer</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Decitabine
is an epigenetic inhibitor belonging to the class of DNA- demethylating agents 1.
After absorbance by cells, decitabine is absorbed by DNA 2, 3.
Reductase enzymes in DNA convert decitabine to </span><span><span>5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine
diphosphate, and phosphorylates it, removing methyl groups from cytosine at
promoter sequences 3. Inhibition of DNA methyltransferases causes
formation of hemi-methylated DNA which causes demethylation of another strand </span>3. </span><span>The expression of tumour suppressor genes which
had previously been silenced by hypermethylation is then reactivated 2.
As such, the normal regulatory function of these genes are restored, causing
cell arrest and apoptosis of cancerous cells 2, 3. These help to
prevent further proliferation of the cancer- this is good as chemotherapy often
causes death of non-cancerous cells too </span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alterations in DNA methylation can have enduring effects on
the epigenome due to imprinting. Imprinting is the process whereby
environmental changes are incorporated in the genome. These incorporations are
more likely to occur during sensitive periods. A sensitive period is a time
frame during which there is establishment of epigenetic marks. Sensitive
periods of development are early development, from E0 to E8.5 and pre-conception.
It is not advised to treat patients during sensitive periods as there is
resulting hypomethylation or hypermethylation could lead to loss of imprinting
if there is incomplete clearing of epigenetic marks during reprogramming.</p>
