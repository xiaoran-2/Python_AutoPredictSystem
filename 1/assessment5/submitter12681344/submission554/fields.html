    <div class="field-value">cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene<span>. Intragenic methylation is found at repetitive sequences such as satellite repeats and remnants of retroviral insertions such as LINEs and SINEs in human DNA </span><span>. Gene body methylation is present in highly expressed genes and it has been speculated that this may repress transcriptional noise from alternative start sites, inhibit antisense transcription or direct RNA splicing and relates to replication timing. </span>The total amount of methylated cytosine is usually decreased resulting in global hypomethylation. Decreased cytosine methylation typically affects satellite DNA, repetitive sequences, and CpG sites located in gene bodies (introns and inner exons).<br />Most mutations and epigenetic alterations occurring in cancer cells are probably harmless. Many genes methylated in tumors are not expressed in relevant normal tissues and their silencing by methylation is inconsequential. However, disabling of genes that are critically important to controlling cell proliferation contributes to the development of a malignant phenotype in the same manner as inactivating mutations of tumor suppressor genes.<br />A complex code created by covalent modifications of amino acids in histone tails is also heavily involved in chromatin disturbances in cancer. Some genes mutated in cancer recruit histone modifying enzymes and thus alter gene expression.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><a href="http://epigenie.com/epigenie-learning-center/epigenetics/cancer-epigenetics"></a></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"> Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon whereby specific mammalian genes are expressed preferentially from the allele inherited either from the father or from the mother. The maternally inherited allele of the imprinted gene encoding insulin-like growth factor 2 (<i>IGF2</i><span>) is normally epigenetically silenced, resulting in expression almost exclusively from the paternal allele. Loss of imprinting (LOI) at the </span><i>IGF2</i>locus results in biallelic expression of this mitogenic growth factor in approximately 10% of normal human adults and is implicated in several types of cancer  and Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome <span>. In most individuals, the cause of </span><i>IGF2</i><span> LOI is unknown.<br /></span><span>Because of the unique epigenetic requirements associated with allele-specific expression, genomically imprinted genes may be especially sensitive to epigenetic dysregulation by environmental influences during development.</span><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic events, such as aberrant DNA methylation, have been demonstrated to silence the expression of many genes that suppress malignancy. Since the event is reversible, it is an interesting target for intervention with specific inhibitors of DNA methylation, such as 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (decitabine). 5-AZA-CdR is a prodrug that requires activation via phosphorylation by deoxcytidine kinase. The nucleotide analog is incorporated into DNA, where it produces an irreversible inactivation of DNA methyltransferase. 5-AZA-CdR is an S-phase–specific agent. The demethylation of DNA by this analog in neoplastic cells can lead to the reactivation of silent tumor-suppressor genes, induction of differentiation or senescence, growth inhibition, and loss of clonogenicity. However, most AML patients induced into complete remission with 5-AZA-CdR will relapse, which provides a rationale to search for other agents to use in combination to increase the effectiveness of the therapy.  <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Unlike other forms of gene regulation (those involving transcription factors, for example), epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells. <span>These sensitive periods represent heightened epochs of brain plasticity, where the early environment is able to shape neural circuits and thus determine structural and functional aspects of brain and behavior for the lifespan. <br /></span>Studies have shown that experiences during sensitive periods of development can program genes through DNA methylation. To date, such epigenetic alterations have been identified for several genes known to play prominent roles in cognition and psychiatric disorders.<span><br />SO MEDICINES MAY NOT BE SO EFFECTIVE<br /></span></div>
