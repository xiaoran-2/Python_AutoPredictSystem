    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The DNA methylation is the most important epigenetic
marks in the genome, in this case mammalian cancer. There are some regions in
our genome called CpG islands that are free of methylation enzymes, but when
these promoter CpG regions are hypermethylated
which then silencing of the underlying gene causes genomic instability and
deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes and on the other hand
silencing of tumor suppressor genes – controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA
repair. In this case, the methylation could provoke the cancer, because the
inactivated CpG promoters that avoid the genes related with the cell division
stability. Nevertheless, the DNA methylation. </span></p>

<p><span>The methylation is so important for the DNA that
affect in different ways the genetic expression, because the this epigenetic
mark is found in intragenic regions
called repetitive sequences such as satellite and regions where are remnants of
retroviral insertions where there are highly expressed genes repress and
inhibit antisense transcription or direct RNA splicing and relates to
replication timing</span><span>.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>  </span> Normally in the male cells the H19/Igf2 locus has
methylation, but in the female cells this methylation does not exist. This
unmethylation in the female cells is maintained by the complex CTCF that binds
whit the H19/Igf2, and obviously this complex is not in the male cells allele H19/Igf2
because in this case has methylated marks, which leads to silencing of the H19
gene as the enhancers in its place drive expression of Igf2. Nevertheless,
when this allele is
hypermethylated, in appear in both strands  to be of paternal origin and get expressed. This
system causes a double dose of (growth­promoting) Igf2 (as well as no dose of
H19). This is associated with Wilm's tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>According with the lecture, the enzyme Decitabine
belongs to a class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, and this enzyme acting
in the  hypomethylation of DNA, it means
is a enzyme that unmethylated the DNA. In this way, the Decitabine is important
for treating the <i>myelodysplatic</i> <i>syndrome</i>. This syndrome is when the bone
narrow produces deformed blood cells, a precursor of leukemia. For this reason
the Decitabine has a antitumor, anticancer effect, because linked to
reactivation of epigenetically silenced tumor supressor genes, thought the

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The DNA methylation is a good method for the
treatment of cancer, because could be manipulated, and has many effects like
resistance and endurance that the DNA methyltransferase enzymes preserve methyl
marks during mitosis. However, this manipulated need to be controlled because
exist some period of embryo development when there are extensive epigeniectis reprograming,
and the bad manipulated could be interfere with normal functions of the life
system. For this reason, manipulated the DNA metylation need to be when the
women is nót pregnant, because the most important reprogramming epigenetic
marks occurs in this moment, when the embryo is development their sexual cells,
 and the stem cells comeback specific
tissues cells </span></p>
