    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value">In normal cells CpG islands are generally not methylated. However, in cancer cells, they are more likely to be methylated. This CpG island hypermethylation (or CGI hypermethylation) is observed in the promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes, leading to the silencing of these genes. It has been shown that this epigenetic inactivation of tumor suppressor genes (which is mitotically heritable and therefore stably transmitted to daughter cells) can be one of the hits required for tumor formation. In contrast to CpG islands, repetitive elements and intergenic regions are hypermethylated in normal cells. This ensures the maintenance of genomic stability by preventing the recombination between repeats, the activation of the repeats (which can then make copies of themselves and transpose into other regions of the genome) and the activation of cryptic promoters. However, in cancer cells these regions are hypomethylated leading to the occurrence of the above mentioned events and consequently to chromosomal abnormalities such as deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations. This genomic instability can contribute to tumorigenesis as evidenced in many cancers.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster, the imprint control region (ICR) is methylated on the paternal allele. This blocks the insulator protein CTCF from binding to the ICR (and insulating the Igf2 gene form the downstream enhancers). The enhancers can therefore activate Igf2 leading to its expression. In the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated; CTCF can bind to the ICR and insulate Igf2 from the enhancers, which instead activate H19. In summary, normally Igf2 is expressed from the paternal allele and is silent in the maternal allele. However, in Wilm's tumor there is loss of imprinting at the <span>H19/Igf2 cluster;</span> what is observed is the hypermethylation of the ICR on the maternal allele as well, leading to the expression of Igf2 from both alleles. Igf2 is a gene that promotes growth, therefore its overexpression (actually double the normal expression) can contribute to this particular type of cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is one of the few FDA approved drugs that target the epigenetic machinery. It belongs to the class of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors. Essentially it is a nucleoside analogue and is therefore incorporated into the DNA of dividing cells during replication. DNMT1 (which ensures maintenance of DNA methylation during mitosis by binding to hemi-methylated DNA and copying the methylation to the daughter strands) binds to this nucleoside analogue but then cannot be released. This leads to DNA demethylation since the function of DNMT1 is prevented. The action of this drug requires DNA replication (i.e. cell division) to occur, therefore it will only affect dividing cells. Since cancer cells divide much more rapidly than other cells in the body they will be the ones to be affected to a greater degree.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, i.e. it is passed on to daughter cells during cell division. Therefore altering it can have an enduring effect on the epigenome. Sensitive periods are defined as the periods in development when epigenetic marks are removed (epigenetic reprogramming). These periods are (a) during germ cell development, (b) during early embryonic development (preimplantation stage). Treating patients during sensitive periods, e.g young patients at the germ cell development age, might lead to epigenotype alterations that affect future generations.</div>
