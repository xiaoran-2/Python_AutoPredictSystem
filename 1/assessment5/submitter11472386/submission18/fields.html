    <div class="field-value">At CpG islands, DNA is generally unmethylated. This absence of CpG methylation allows expression of the associated genes (non-methylated regions are generally euchromatic).  In cancer, instead, CpG islands are generally hypermethylated, leading to heterochromatin and underexpression of the associated genes, which are often tumor suppressor genes. So, increased methylation of CpG islands silences tumor suppressor genes and, thus, can lead to the development of tumors. <br /><br />DNA is generally methylated in intergenic regions and repetitive elements, where it maintains genomic integrity. In intergenic regions, DNA methylation silences cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites, and by preventing insertions, deletions, and inversions. In repetitive elements DNA methylation silences,  for example, the expression of transposable elements. Methylation of repetitive elements also avoids transcriptional interference from strong promotors and prevents recombination of repetitive regions from different chromosomes because the methylated regions are heterochromatic, densely packed, and not well accessible (open). In cancer, DNA is hypermethylated in intergenic regions, where it can lead to oncogene activation, and in repeat regions, where it can lead to genomic instability. For example, hypomethylation of repetitive elements can lead  to recombination of non-homologous regions, and ,thus, to reciprocal translocations . Also, hypomethylation removes silencing of transposable elements, which can make a copy of themselves and insert at a different region in the genome, contributing to genomic instability by disrupting expression of oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Disruption of the methylation pattern in the imprinting control region (ICR) of the H19/Igf2 cluster can contribute to the development of cancer. <br />The paternal allele is normally methylated at the ICR, which insulates this region and blocks binding of CTCF. Enhancers downstream of  H19 act in this case on the promotor of Igf2. The maternal allele, in contrast is normally not methylated at the ICR. Enhancers act in this case on the promotor of H19 and Igf is silent. <br />Hypermethylation of the ICR in both maternal and paternal genes leads to Igf2 overexression (both allele behave as the normal paternal allele). Igf2 is a growth factor and its overexpression contributes to the development of Wilm's tumor<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine, sold as Dacogen by Eisai (<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168">http://www.economist.com/node/21552168</a>), is a DNA-demethylating agent, which inhibits DNMTs (DNA methyl transferases). Decitabine gets incorporated in the DNA and  binds DNMTs irreversibly. These blocked DNMTs can then not methylate cytosines in replication forks. Its effect, thus, depends on active replication . As cancer cells divide more rapidly than other (normal) somatic tissues, they inhibit DNA-methylation more in tumor tissue than in normal somatic tissue. Decitabine is a drug used against myelodysplastic syndrome. It can have an anti-tumour effect in this case, because myelodysplastic syndome is characterized by hypermethylation in CpG islands that normally inhibit tumor suppressor genes.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that alter DNA methylation (such as Decitabine, which is a DNMT inhibitor) can have enduring effects on the epigenome because the methylation-state of a cytosine is copied to the daughter DNA-strand during replication via DNMTs (DNA methyl transferases). Once the methyl-group is hindered from being attached to a cytosine, all daughter strands that are replicated from this cytosine will also not carry a methyl-group.<br />Treating patients with such drugs during sensitive periods,  like the period of embryonic development and germ cell development, in not advisable. During sensitive periods epigenetic marks are cleared and reset. Disturbing the methylation pattern during these phases would alter the expression of a wide range of genes. It would affect the germ cells if it is applied during the period of germ cell development and it would affect the entire organism if it is applied during early embryonic development.<br /> <br /><br /></div>
