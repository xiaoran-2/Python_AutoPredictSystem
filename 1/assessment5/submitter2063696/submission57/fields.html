    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells CpG islands are hypomethylated, which allows the genes to be expressed, but the repetitive elements, the introns of genes and intergenic regions are methylated. CpG islands typically occur near or at the transcription start site of genes, so this housekeeps the genes.The DNA methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements does not silence gene expression, it maintains genomic stability.</p><p>In cancer cells CpG islands are more methylated than CpG islands of normal cells, and the rest of the genome is hypomethylated, that is, the intergenic elements, the introns and the repetitive elements. This hypomethylation disrupts the normal functioning of the cells. This could be caused genetically or could be caused by epigenetic factors. In general this hypermethylation of CpG islands is found in the promoters of tumour supressor genes. This causes these genes to be silenced and then we could have mutations.</p><p>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements maintains genetic stability, but in cancer both suffer hypomethylation so the intergenic regions become misaligned and illegitimating recombination can occur because they are not densed packed down into heterochromatin. Repeats can make a copy of themselves and jump around the genome or transpose and activating genes generating genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, the paternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster has an ICR (Imprint Control Region) methylated, so the enhancers will act on Igf2 and not on the H19 which is silenced. The maternal allele has Igf2 silenced because enhancers will act on H19. This allele has its ICR activated due to the presence of CTCF, so the enhancers cannot act on Igf2.</p><p>In the example of disruption of imprinting leading to cancer in H19/Igf2 cluster, the maternal allele does not have CTCF acting on ICR. Then both maternal and paternal alleles have hypermethylation of both ICRs. The enhancers of both alleles will act on both Igf2s and H19 will be silenced in both alleles. We will have a double dose of Igf2 which is a growth promoting and this event is associated with Wilm's tumour.</p><p>Hypomethylation or Hypermethylation of ICRs can result in loss of expression or overexpression of growth disrupting genes which can lead to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent or a DNA demethylating agent, which hypomethylates DNA. It does this by inhibinting DNA methyltransferase and it is incorporated into DNA strands.</p><p>Decitabine is a drug which can be used in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes. Myelodysplastic syndrome is a class of conditions where certain blood cells are dysfunctional. It is also used for acute myelogenous leukaemia. Decitabine is sold as Dacogen.</p><p>Decitabine is a deoxy derivative of azacitidine. According to the article, a combination of a histone deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine slowed tumour growth in some people with advanced lung cancer. It was the first time epigenetic drugs had been deployed successfully against a solid tumour. These solid tumours are harder to treat because the drug has to penetrate them.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome. These effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment are caused because once the marks are done they go on by mitotically division.</p><p>According to the article epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to generation after generation of cells until the tumour cells are activelly erased. Once they are erased they do not return. So enduring changes stopping cancer growth without killing all its cells could be obtained using the effect of epiginetic therapies.</p><p>Periods of epigenetic reprogramming are sensitive periods. First, they are  the period of production of germ cells until the maturity , that is the formation of the sperm and of the egg. Second the pre implantation and early post implantation period of the embryo.</p><p>The treatment of patients during sensitive periods should not be done because this can lead to negative epigenetic effects. This is because in these periods germ cells are not methylated and are being reprogrammed.</p></div>
