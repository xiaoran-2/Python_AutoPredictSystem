    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In case of normal cells, CpG islands, generally located in promoters of constitutive genes are unmethylated leading to expression of that gene. But, genome wide hypermethylation in introns of genes, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are also observed.<br />In contrast, in Cancer cell,  CpG islands and CpG island shores of tumor suppressor genes (locus specific) are hypermethylated. But, genome wide hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters (leading to oncogene activation), introns of genes, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are seen. <br />Methylation of CpG island leads to silencing of tumor suppressor genes. DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, hence, this pass on to its daughter cells. This epimutation results in loss of control of cell division in cancerous cells. As a result, these cells will not die as often as normal cells, divide more rapidly and take over normal cells.<br />Hypomethylation of intergenic and repeat regions leads to genomic instability such as illegitimate recombination between repeats, transposition and activation of cryptic promoters which normally remain silenced. As a result, some genes may loose/gain function, or DNA may not be stably transferred to daughter cells to function as normal cells.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Disruption of imprinting leads to expression from both the alleles or loss of expression from both the alleles which may lead to suppression of growth restricting genes or increased expression of growth promoting genes. In normal cells, the paternal ICRs and H19 promoters are methylated which leads to non binding of CTCF with ICR, as a result, the enhancers binds with Igf2 leading to increased expression of Igf2 from paternal allele. However in maternal  ICRs and H19 promoters are non methylated which leads to binding of 
CTCF with ICR, as a result, the enhancers instead of binding with Igf2 acts on H19 gene leading to silencing of maternal  Igf2 allele expression. <br />In case of Wilm's tumor, ICRs and H19 promoter of both maternal and paternal alleles gets hypermethylated and this leads to binding of enhancers to Igf2 gene leading to its increased expression (doubled dose than normal). Igf2 is a growth promoter and its elevated expression leads to tumorogenesis.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is an anticancerous drug used to treat myelodisplastic syndrome (precursor of acute myelogenous leukemia). It is classified as antineoplastic/cytotoxic. It belongs to DNMTi (DNA methyl transferase inhibitor). It hypomethylates CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase leading to activation of tumor suppressor genes causing anti-tumorigenic effect. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">According to research lead by Dr Stephen Baylin, epigenetic drugs produce more enduring effect as compared to standard chemo drugs. This is because epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable to daughter cells with each division, until they are erased actively. Further, standard chemotherapy leads to death of all the fast dividing cells. However, epigenetic therapies leads to transformation of cancerous cells to normal cells through repeated divisions. Sensitive periods are the period of development when epigenome of an individual undergoes active epigenetic reprogramming. It includes 2 developmental timings namely, preimplantation period of early development and primordial germ cell development (spermatogenesis and oogenesis). Treating patients with epigenetic drugs during these sensitive periods may lead to aberrant or illegitimate epigenetic reprogramming which may cause abnormalities or even death of next generation/embryo. <br /></div>
