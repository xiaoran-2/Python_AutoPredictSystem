    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is an specific epigenetic modification consist in addition of a methyl group particulary CpG islands almost exclusively in mammals it are hypomethylated at promoters of genes, their function is maintain gene silencing through cell division-DNA methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer because occurs two epigenetic mistakes fist CpGs locus specific promoter tend to become hypermethylated and  second Genome-wide hypomethylation-CpG - So CpG hypermethylation is a way to genetic mutation to silence tumour suppressor genes in cancer- Normal cell is hypomethylated CpG islands in general, but we can see DNA in general is methylated in their repetitive elements and intergenetic region- moreover repetitive elements and intergenetic region are hypomethylated in cancer cell- So the hypomethylated of intergenetic region, repetitive element and hypermethylation CpG island is a kind of swap which contributes hypometylation hypomethylation genome-wide,genomic instability,and tumour suppressor hypermethylation genes to development of cancer</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Disturbance in DNA methylation  hypermethylation or hypomethylation lead to ICRs-loss of imprinting - normal cell ICR paternal allele will be methylated, so the enhancers acts on Igf2 and the expression satatus is active- ICR is unmethylated in maternal allele , so CTCF binds this insulater element, means the enhancers in this case will act on H19 , but Igf2 espression status will be silent for the maternal allele- on the other hand , when hypermethylation occurs in ICR on the maternal allele and paternal allele ,we have double dose, both Igf2 drive along overexpression  which is associated with Wilms tumour</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is DNA demethylating agent which acts like epigenetic inhibitor- Decitabine acts as histone deacethylase inhibitor- Decitabine acts to silence tumour suppressor genes so it´s slowed tumour growth.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation in tumour may have enduring effects on the epigenome because DNA methylation in mitotically heritable<br />Sensitive period means epigenetic reprogramming and genomic imprinting when the epigenetic marks need to be clearing and resetting between generation to restore totipotency, first pre-implantation early developmment and primordial germ cell development<br />There are two sensitive periods of development , one is during pre-implantation early development and the second is during primordial germ cell development<br />Treating patients during sensitive periods it´s not advisable because it can be altered the epigenetic  reprogramming and genomic imprinting both in early development and primordial germ cell development</div>
