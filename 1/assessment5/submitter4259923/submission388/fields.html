    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>In a <strong>normal cell</strong>, methylation is more spreaded throughout the genome, being largely present in introns and intergenic regions. In a <strong>cancer cell</strong>, methylation is more diluted in those regions, and more likely to be found in CpG islands, as those of promoters of tumor suppressors genes, <strong>silencing them</strong>. These islands are therefore hypermethylated in cancer cells genome, and also mitotically heritable, contributing to <strong>tumor proliferating</strong>.</div><div>Disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements, which become hypomethylated, can contributes to cancer through illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes. All of this can lead to genomic instability, as deletions, insertions and translocations.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Cancer cells are very likely to show loss of imprinting methylation, so both alleles become expressed <b>or</b> both silenced, depending on the specific imprinting pattern.</div><div>In <b>normal cells</b>, the H19/Igf2 cluster presents the paternal allele methylated in ICR and in H19 (both unexpressed), so enhancers are able to act upstream upon Igf2, which is expressed. On the other hand, the maternal ICR is not methylated, then insulated by CTFC protein, then enhancers are not able to act upon Igf2, which is silenced; H19 is also not methylated, then expressed.</div><div>In <b>cancer</b>, both alleles are methylated, so the CTCF region of maternal allele are not insulated, leading to expression of Igf2 also in the maternal allele, therefore a double dose of Igf2 - a <b>growth</b> promoting agent. This is a characteristic of Wilms' tumour, a particular child kidney cancer. It has been shown that this event may occur early in cancer development, indeed in pre neoplastic period.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the class of <strong>DNA-demethylating agents</strong>, and is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. It has <strong>potential </strong>to be used to demethylate tumour suppressor genes, for example. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic changes are<strong> mitotically heritable</strong>, so it might be an effective change, which may stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.<br /><strong>Sensitive periods</strong> are those when epigenetic marks are established/ remodelled in some of group of cells. For example, during early development of an embryo, or during the development of his/ her germ line cells. So it would be inadvisable the use of such drugs in a pregnant woman, for example.</div>
