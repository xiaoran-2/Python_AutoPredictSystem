    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, CpG
islands are located at the promotors of suppressor genes and are
hypomethylated. This allows the gene to be switched on and transcribed, thus suppressing
tumour cell growth.</p>

<p>In cancer cells, the CpG
islands are more likely to be methylated. This would contribute to cancer by
silencing the tumour suppressor gene, allowing tumour cells to proliferate. </p>

<p>Intergenic regions and
repetitive elements are normally methylated which contributes to genomic
stability. Methylation in these regions silence genes which do not need to be
expressed, or prevents overexpression of genes.</p>

<p><span>DNA methylation in these
regions is disrupted in cancer by genome wide hypomethylation. It contributes
to cancer by causing the genome to become unstable through reciprocal
translocations, gene deletions, and gene insertions (transpositions).</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is
an imprinted gene responsible for growth promotion. On the paternal allele the
imprint control region (ICR) and H19 are methylated. Consequently CTCF cannot
bind to the ICR and insulate Igf2. This causes the enhancers to act on Igf2 and
Igf2 is then expressed. </p>

<p>On the maternal allele
there is no methylation of the ICR or H19. CTCF can bind to the unmethylated
ICR which prevents the enhancers from expressing Igf2. Instead H19 is acted on
and expressed. </p>

<p><span>In Wilm’s tumour there is
hypermethylation and loss of imprinting on the maternal allele at H19/Igf2. The
ICR and H19 are methylated, causing the enhancers to act on Igf2 and silencing
H19 expression. The result is twice as much Igf2 being expressed, resulting in
Wilm’s Tumour.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a DNA DNMT
inhibitor. It is a DNA demethylating agent. Decitabine could therefore have an
anti-tumour effect by decreasing DNA methylation during an episode of
myelodysplastic syndrome allowing tumour suppressor genes to be turned on.
Since the epigenetic mark is replicated during cell division, the cancerous
cells would be suppressed as cells expressing tumour suppressor gene would take
over.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic marks are
actively removed and remodelled in preparation for the next generation during
epigenetically sensitive periods. These periods include early embryonic
development and gametogenesis. Paternal and maternal genomes are cleared and
reset during these sensitive periods. The methylation of imprinted genes are
reset during gametogenesis and maintained during early embryonic development
whereas repetitive elements tend to resist methylation at these typically
sensitive periods, probably to maintain genomic stability. </p>

<p><span>The effect of drugs that
alter DNA methylation are passed on to each replicating cell thereafter until
the epigenetic marks are cleared during sensitive periods. Therefore a drug
that effectively cures a cancer will continue the effect until the altered
methylation mark is erased. In light of this, it would probably be advisable to
avoid treating cancer patients with DNA methylation altering drugs during
epigenetically sensitive periods to ensure that epigenetic anomalies are not
passed on to the next generation. <span> </span></span></p></div>
