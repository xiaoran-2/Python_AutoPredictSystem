    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is when a single methyl (CH3-) group is added to cytosine at position 5. In mammals, it is required proper embryogenesis and development, sustaining chromosomal stability, telomere length and predetermined gene expression states. CpG methylation is a silencing epigenetic mark that usually develops as a defense against expression of parasitic DNA elements.When total amount of methylated cytosine is decreased global hypomethylation occurs which affects satelite DNA,repetitive sequences and CpG sites located in gene bodies (introns and inner exons). Most cancers have shown 
focal hypermethylation in distinct subsets of promoter-associated CpG 
islands and affected genes are permanently silenced, since methylation 
marks are propagated through mitosis and are maintained in the malignant
 clone. Aberrant de novo hypermethylation occurring in transformed cells
 serves as an alternative mechanism for inactivation of tumor suppressor
 genes. Hundreds to thousands of genes can be epigenetically silenced by
 CpG island hypermethylation in human cancer suggesting a 
general disturbance of epigenetic memory. The CpG island methylation inactivates mutations of tumor suppressor genes. RB150, p16 (CDKN2A)51, VHL52, and 
MLH153 genes can be inactivated by either DNA 
methylation or a mutation with equal consequences for cancer 
development. DNA methylation at intergenic regions silence cryptic transcription start sites to avoid abnormalities karyotipically due to genomic instability such as deletions, reciprocal translocations and insertions. DNA methylation at repetitive elements maintain genomic integrity through silencing of repeats to repeats to prevent transposition and to avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters also prevents illegitimate recombination. Some genes mutated in 
cancer recruit histone modifying enzymes and thus alter gene expression.
 For example, the PML-RAR gene translocation in acute promyelocytic 
leukemia recruits histone deacetylases that change the chromatin 
structure from active to silenced and contribute to leukemic 
transformation<br /><div><br /></div><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The paternal allele is methylated at ICR thereby blocking the binding of CTCF, without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence and enhancers can access lgf2 to activate.  The maternal allele is unmethylated at ICR, this results in binding of the CTCF which is an insulator protein that insulates lgf2 from downstream enhancers deactivating it. Imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour when predisposition to embroyonic/ childhood tumours occurs but not adult tumours. Many imprinted genes are involved in growth, therefore loss of imprinting is a common feature of cancer. ICR have different modes of action which control parent-of-origin expression at the imprinted cluster. Mutation or deletion at H19/Igf2 causes loss of imprinting thereby disabling of genes that
 are critically important to controlling cell proliferation contributes 
to the development of a malignant phenotype in the same manner as 
inactivating mutations of tumor suppressor genes. Epigenetic silencing
 by DNA methylation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, DNA 
repair genes, apoptosis mediators, nuclear receptors, 
transcription factors, cell adhesion molecules, and many other genes
 has been reported in multiple cancer types.   <br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Decitabine
is a DNA-demethylating agent  used to
treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.  DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, and originally thought to be irremovable, except by failure to maintain methylation by DNMT1.DNA methylation is an alternative to genetic mutation,
to silence tumour suppressor genes in cancer. Cancer cells have methylated of CpG
islands while intergernic and repetitive regions are not methylated.  This results in deletions, reciprocal
translocations and insertions. However, demethylating agent can reverse these
effects thereby stabilizing the genome through passive and active DNA demetylation.

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Epigenetic
changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells
until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. It
might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a
cancer growing without having to kill all its cells. Sensitive periods are
those experienced when altered environments have an effect on epigenetic
control. Sensitive periods of development are at formation of gametes, during
fertilization of an egg, blastocyst and epiblast formation. Also on development
of premordal germ cells. Patients should not be treated during sensitive
periods because the effects of drugs may influence detrimental changes to the
target region, which can be difficult to reverse, therefore abnormalities may
affect the offspring.</span><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
