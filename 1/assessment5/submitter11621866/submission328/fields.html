    <div class="field-value">CpG islands(CGIs) are usually unmethylated in normal tissues.However, in 5-10% of cancers they become hypermethylated which is associated with gene silencing.If the promoter CGI of a tumour suppressor gene is silenced then this activates the oncogene giving rise to cancer. This change is mitotically heritable and so a mass of daughter cells with the same epigenetic error is formed. In normal tissues the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually kept silent by  hypermethylation.In cancer these regions are hypomethylated and thus active which can cause genome instability  such as activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of nearby genes. Illegitimate recombination between long repeats might occur causing translocations and duplication or deletions. Activation of  promoters of transposable elements might arise causing transposition and more gene disruption especially if these elements jump into the promoters of tumour suppressor genes or indeed into the control regions of genes involved in  epigenetic regulation. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The H19 Igf2 cluster is a reciprocally imprinted gene cluster controlled by epigenetic enhancer blocking.Igf2 is paternally expressed and H19 is maternally expressed. Monoallelic expression is achieved by paternal specific methylation within the differentially methylated regions (DMR1 and 2) of the Igf2 gene and the imprint control region (ICR) of the H19 gene. Paternal transcription is silenced by methylation at the ICR which prevents the insulator protein  CCCTC- binding factor (CTCF) binding there which in turn allows the upstream enhancers to preferentially loop out and activate the Igf2 gene driving its expression. Methylation of this ICR  also spreads to the promoter of the H19 gene silencing it.The ICR on the maternal allele is unmethylated allowing CTCF to bind and block  the enhancers binding the Igf2 promoter and so they then bind their second preferred target which is the promoter on the long non-coding RNA H19.In Wilm's tumour there is a loss of imprinting of the maternal allele whereby the H19 ICR is methylated causing the maternal allele to behave like a paternal allele and hence there is  double the amount of Igf2 being produced. This in turn causes rapid cells grow and tumour formation.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is DNA methyltranferase inhibitor.It is a nucleoside analogue that irreversibly binds DNA methyltransferase 1(DNMT1) during DNA replication. This  drug has been shown to be therapeutic in myeloid dysplastic syndromes where CGIs are known to be hypermethylated. Reducing these extra methylation patterns by adding an exogenous DNMT1 inhibitor could return CGI promoter methylation levels to that seen normal non-neoplastic cells. The fact that it acts during cell division makes it more targetable to rapidly dividing cells such as cancer cells.  </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation can have lasting effects on the epigenome as methylation patterns are mitotically heritable and persist through the germline as there is incomplete clearing of epigenetic marks during the two rounds of reprogramming during mammalian development. During primordial germ cell maturation the somatic cell specific epigenetic marks are cleared to allow for the establishment of gamete specific marks in the sperm and oocyte and during  pre-implantation of the zygote these gamete specific marks are cleared to allow totipotency of all cells within the developing organism. However, imprinted genes escape this reprogramming in early development so changes to methylation patterns would persist. These reprogramming episodes are the sensitive periods during development and are highly susceptible to aberrations. Administering drugs during these periods would alter the reprogramming of these epigenetic marks giving rise to the possible activation of  silenced IAPs and other developmental problems like Prader Willi and Beckwith Weideman syndromes. This is highlighted by the increase of epigenetic imprinting disorders in assisted reproduction technologies in cattle where the oocyte and zygote are manipulated during both of these sensitive periods.</div>
