    <div class="field-value">   CpG islands, which is found in about 60% of promoters have a high CpG density and are usually free of methylation independent of normal cells (Hassler and Egger, 2012). <br />   In cancer cells, promoter CpG island tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying genes (Hassler and Egger, 2012). <br />   The hypermethylation of promoter CpG islands of tumor suppressing genes leads to the silencing of the genes. These tumor suppressing genes control cell cycle, apoptosis and DNA repair (Hassler and Egger, 2012), crucial processes of the normal cell processes, the disruption of which is believed to lead to the oncogenesis. <br />   Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) are coded by intergenic regions (Hassler and Egger, 2012), the regulation of their transcription is finely controlled by epigenetic processes especially methylation so as to maintain normal status of cells. The repetitive elements are often active or remnant transposons. The suppression of the transposon expression by methylation is crucial for the genome integrity.<br />   Hypometylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements is often observed in cancer cells (Hassler and Egger, 2012). <br />   Hypometylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements leads to the breakdown of the control of lncRNA expression, suppression of transposon expression which leads to the loss of genome integrity and nucleus morphology. All these are believed to lead to the oncogenesis.   <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">   H19 encodes a long non translated RNA, involved in imprinting. The CpG island of paternal H19 gene promoter is highly methylated, leading to the silencing of the gene. H19 acts in cis to repress Igf2 expression, so paternal Igf2 is expressed because H19 is silent (Wikipedia).<br />   The CpG island of maternal H19 promoter is not methylated, leading to the expression of H19 RNA, leading to the suppression of the maternal Igf2 gene (Wikipedia).<br />   Igf2 undergoes loss of imprinting (LOI) in most Wilms' tumours (WT). LOI of Igf2 is associated with a 80−fold down regulation of H19 expression (Steenman et al., 1994).<br />   Igf2 promotes cell proliferation. H19 that suppresses its expression thus acts as a tumor suppressor gene. The disruption of imprinting changes the dose of Igf2, causing abnormality in cell proliferation, leading to cancer (Steenman et al., 1994).  </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">   Decitabine, sold as Dacogen by Eisai as a human drug is DNA-demethylating agent (Economist article).<span><br />   </span>Decitabine is a hypomethylating
agent. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase (Wikipedia).<br />   The myelodysplastic syndromes (also known as MDS or myelodysplasia) are hematological medical conditions with ineffective production of all blood cells. MDS is caused by abnormal gene expression due to the inappropriate methylation of DNA. Decitabine fixes this condition by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase (Wikipedia). </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">   One of the mechanisms of the maintenance of DNA methylation through mitosis is that in semi-conservative DNA replication, DNA methyltransferace preferentially methylate unmethylated CpG complemental to the methylated CpG. But there may be more complexities (Bird, 2002). <br />   In early embryogenesis and the primordial germ cells of mammals, percentage of DNA methylation falls (Seisenberger et al. 2012). At these periods, environmental condition highly affects the establishment of epigenetic status necessary for normal development (according to the lecture).<br />   De novo DNA methylation in sensitive period is necessary for normal development. Treating pregnant mother with the drug affects the epigenetic establishment of the fetus in the sensitive period.  </div>
