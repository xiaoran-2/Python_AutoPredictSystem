    <div class="field-value"><div>The main function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is prohibition of transcription factors binding and altering gene expression. It is laid down de novo by DNMT3A and DNMT3B and is mainteained by DNMT1. CpG island methylation is connected with formation of repressive chromatin structure. In the case of cancer  it is observed locus specific DNA hypermethylation in CpG islands and CpG islands shores of tumour supressor genes. So in this case it isn't  observed expression of tumour supressor genes and it can lead to cancer development. Identity of hypermethylated CGIs varies by tumour type. For example hypermethylation of RB causes retinoblastoma, hypermethylation of MLH1 causes colorecatal cancer, in the case of BRCA1 it causes breast cancer, and in the case of HGMT it causes glioma and colorectal tumours. CGI hypermethylation progresses with time, but confounded by DNA methylation alterations increase with age. Hypermethylation of tumour supressor genes is more frequent than mutations.  CpG island shores methylation in cancer correlates with gene expression, as it does in normal tissue differntiation.<br />The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is connected with silencing these elements because it helps to prevent transposition, transcriptional interference from strong promoter and illegitimate recombination. In this case, in cancer, it is observed genome-wide hypomethylation. Hypomethylation of repeats occurs in all tumour types which were tested. It also progresses with tumourigenisity. Hypomethylation of repeats can lead to illegitimate recombination between repeats. It can activate transposition of these repeats, activate cryptic promoters and disrupt neighbouring genes. So hypomethylation leads to genomic instability and can lead to unpreferable mutations. It is shown hypomethylation due to deletion of DNMT1 in specific tissues increases genomic instability in Mouse models. In the case of humans mutations in DNMT3B result in ICF syndrome where genomic instability is  characteristic feature.<br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">H19/Igf2 cluster is an example of clusters with imprinted gene expression. H19/Igf2 cluster is located on human chromosome 11. The mechanism of action of ICR in this case is enchancer blocking. <br />In maternal allele there is no methylation at ICR. So in this case CTCF (it is an insulator protein) binds to this region. CTCF insulates Igf2 from downstream enchancers. So there is no expression of Igf2. And DNA methylation doesn't spread to H19 promoter and enchancers activate  this gene. <br />In paternal allele it is observed methylation of ICR. So CTCF can't bind to this region. Without CTCF DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence and enchancers can access Igf2 to activate. Igf2 is an oncogene which promotes growth. <br />In the case of Wilm's tumour it is observed overexpression of Igf2 that promotes growth. It is caused by the fact that maternal allele starts to behave like paternal. Wilm' s tumour is a cancer of kidneys and it typically occurs in children. Igf2 promotes growth and proliferation of cells and it  plays an important role in growth and development before birth but upregulation of this gene is connected with cancer development because of abnormal cell growth and proliferation.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent in the form of azacitidine. It is used to treat myelodyspalstics syndrome, the precursors of accute myelogenous leukemia. <br />Azacitidine induces antineoplastic activity. It can inhibit DNA methyltransferase at low doses and it can cause hypomethylation of DNA. This drug can be used in the case of locus specific DNA hypermethylation where tumour supressor genes are not expressed or in the case of loss of imprinting of ICRs where growth factors are overexpressed. Also direct cytotoxicity of azacitidine in abnormal hematopoietic cells through its incorporation into DNA and RNA at high doses causes apoptosis. This drug incorporates into RNA to  larger extent than into DNA. This incorporation into RNA leads to  disruption of  polyribosomes, abnormal methylation and acceptor function of tRNA, and in the end inhibition of the protein production. Azacitidine's incorporation into DNA leads to a covalent binding with DNA methyltransferases, which prevents DNA synthesis.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation has a big influence on epigenome. It can effect the way how we read each and every gene. It causes changes of gene expression that can lead e.g. to cancer development or some other changes. One of the features of DNA methylation is that it is mitotically heritable which means that these epigenetic marks can be inherited by daughter cells after cell division. Mitotic heritability is maintained by DNMT1. <br />Sensitive period in epigenetics is a particular period of time when in maternal and paternal genome epigenome is reprogrammed. At this time environment has a big influence on epigenome. Sensitive period includes early development and primordial germ cell development. <br />So as it was written before epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable and they are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. When they are erased, they will not return. In this case it is not a good idea to use epigenetic therapies during early development and primordial germ cell development as in these period of time it is observed disrupted epigenetic reprogramming. And epigenetic therapy might effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.</div>
