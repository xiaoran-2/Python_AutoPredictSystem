    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normal cells tend to have CpG islands protected from
methylation and , intergenic regions and repetitive elements methylated. However,
when epigenetic suffers modification, CGIs can be found to be methylated, and
genome-wide, hypomethylated, and ,therefore, related to silencing gene
expression and genomic alteration, respectively. In general, CpG
hypermethylation are found in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes, inactivating
tumour suppressor control and contributing to cancer development. In addition
to that, both Intergenic region and repetitive elements hypomethylation
generate instability in the genome. While intergenic hypomethylation allows
transcriptional interference and consequently illegitimate gene transcription,
when repeat elements are unmethylated they allow illegitimate recombination to
occur, e.g. recombination needs genetic identity and open chromatin to happen. They
also can be activated by hypomethylation, replicationg themselves, transposing around
the genome. These can lead to disruption of coding region of a gene or
activation of surrounding genes. Both genetic and epigenetic alteration can
influence one another e.g genetic illegitimate recombination leads to
epigenetic mutation, while epigenetic mutation leads to genetic instability and
consequent aberrant DNA repair. The mistakes in cancer, however, are not
resctricted to one particular epigenetic or genetic alteration, multiple
modifications is needed in order for it to occur. So CpG island mehtylation and
genome-wide demethylation are arising 
over time in cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> In a normal cell, Igf is found to be paternally
imprinted e.g. the paternal allele is found to be methylated in the H19/Igf2 cluster,
while the maternal allele is unmethylated. The unmethylated allele is bonded to
the CTCF complex, enhancing H19 e.g. CTC´s binding insulate Igf, letting the
enhancers free to act on H19. In the paternal allele, CTCF is not bonded to the
paternal strand to inhibit the enhancers to act on Igf2 and therefore , Igf2 is
enhanced and H19 is silenced. To summarize, a normal cell inherit a normal dose
of H19 and Igf2 from the maternal and paternal strand, respectively. However, disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster
contributes to Wilm´s tumour, once both allele will behave as paternal allele e.g. maternal allele will also be hypermthylated and, therefore, double dose of Igf2  enhancement and H19 silencing will be observed.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating drug that is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia, once it inhibit the <span>DNA methyltransferase action. The DNA is found to be hypomethylated and reactived silenced genes, such as tumour supressor genes. Therefore, Decabine anti-tumour effect can be associated to tumour supressor genes expression,</span> inhibiting  cancer growth.<p><br /></p><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA
methylation is found to influence gene transcription/silencing beyond the
period of drug treatment, once this epigenetic alteration is highly preserved during
mitosis and can be trans-generationally inherited through the gametes. This is
only possible because epigenetic modification is
susceptible to environment change, or in this context, chemical therapy. However, critical
periods must be avoided when treating patients, once extensive active
epigenetic remodelling is found to occur and therefore, any environmental
change is potentially able to affect epigenome. The two sensitive periods in
epigenetic control constitute from <span>primordial germ cells development to gametes formation and from pre
to early-post implantation.</span></p></div>
