    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value">CpGs usually present at gene promoters as un-methylated form what ever its functions. <br />While in malignant forms are HyperMethylated. That is why it silencing its genes. <br />It can be called shifting of methylation from gene promoters and intergenic regions as well as to repetitive elements to CpGs.<br /><br />This Hypermethylation will affect different sets for Tumor Suppressor Genes functions and systems, by silencing them, and give chance for uncontrolled cancer cell growth leading to tumors.<br />this silencing processes will come direct by methylation tumor suppressor genes coding area or indirect by silencing their promoters or  their repetitive elements.<br /><br />This uncontrolled cellular growth will generates more error-ed cells with more DNA instability includes deletions, inversions, replications or multiplications as well as trans-locations that can be inherited with more cellular growth of tumor invading more tissues and organs.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">   Normally IGF2 is expressed from the paternal allele, by enhancing of paternal allele enhancers. <br />This enhancing function will be supported by absence of H19 expression at the same allele (paternal), for that Promoters or H19 ICRs should be inactive by methylation (Paternal ICRs). While at maternal allele IGF2 enhancers will not activates with presence of H19 Expression, this expression is mediated by CTFC protein to H19 ICR.<br /><br />   Now for maternal ICRs will be active to bind to CTCF as they are hypomethylated, so expression of H19 will blocks IGF2 enhancers to reach IGF2 and activate it.<br />While at paternal ICRs CTCF can not binds as ICRs ar HyperMethylated, for that no paternal H19 will be expressed for that Paternal IGF2 enhancers will activate its function. <br /><br />   In case like Wilm's tumor the methylation at ICRs of H19 are HyperMethylated and inactive for that expression of H19 is blocked as the same allele will acts on IGF2 for both paternal normal active allele and on the addition maternal allele. That is why double level or concentration of IGF2 will be mediated in such tumors. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">   They found the major types of cancers are related to gene expression disturbances. This type of failure is mediated by epigenetic control process by either methylation or histone modification.<br /><br />    Newly developed modalities for cancer treatments is to reverse epigenetic status of cancer cells to insure returning to normal function if not will be arrest the malignant growth.<br /><br />     For that Desitabine drug developed as DNA Demethylating agent to repress the silencing stress for tumor suppressor genes happened by hypermethylation process. <br /><br />     Desitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. As it works in demethylating those silenced tumor suppressor genes to resume it normal controlling function on cell.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>As general we discussed the types of tumor cells initiation, one is:
<br />   *  Silencing Tumor suppressor genes: those maintains and control cellular growth.
<br />    *  Extra activation or hyper activation to growth promoting genes....<br />   For that both systems will be disturbed, as well part of this system is the epigenetic mechanisms these orchestrate this parallel mechanisms by methylation pattern or histone modifications.
<br /><br />  In cases such hyper methylation of DNA it can be maintained to normal stat by DNA methylating agents that can inverse the silencing of tumor suppressor genes to make better control on cancer cells. <br /><br />  By the way dividing cancer cells will be with more normal methylation pattern, compared to those not treated cells.
  This treatment should consider the sensitive periods particularly during gonads formation or gamete production (Early embryonic developments - with treated malignant pregnant mothers) the timing of epigenetic reprogramming. For that using such DNA demethylating agents can disturb this reprogramming process.</span></div>
