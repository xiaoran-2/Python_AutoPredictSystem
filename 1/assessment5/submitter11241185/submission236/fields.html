    <div class="field-value"><span>DNA becomes
methylated when a methyl group is bonded to a cytosine (C) residue that is
followed by a guanine (G) residue in DNA, which is known as a CpG dinucleotide.  This silences the parts of the genomes it
affects by preventing the binding of transcription factors or interacting with
proteins to condense the chromatin domain, preventing transcription.  </span>CpG islands are usually found at the promoter
regions of genes where the transcription machinery binds, and as a consequence
these areas are usually protected from methylation allowing the machinery to
bind and activating the gene downstream.  In cancerous cells these CpG
islands can become hypermethylated thereby silencing the nearby gene.  If
this is a tumour suppressor gene it can lead to tumourigenesis.  In normal cells intergenic regions and repetitive
elements are usually methylated and consequently silenced to maintain genomic
instability; when active these regions can lead to deletions, insertions,
reciprocal  translocations and cryptic promoter or splice activation
within the gene, all of which can have negative effects on cell function and
eventually organ or even organism function.  In cancer these regions are
found to be hypomethylated and active thereby increasing genomic instability
and leading to tumourigenesis and cancer if tumour suppressor genes are
suppressed and/or oncogenes are activated. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Disruption of
imprinting can contribute to cancer because parentally imprinted regions tend
to be those that control growth; cancer can be caused by overexpression of
genes promoting growth and/or loss of expression of a growth restricting gene,
of which both scenarios could lead to overgrowth of cells and tumourigenesis.
 An example of this is the </span><i>H19/Igf2</i><i> </i>cluster which when disrupted leads to Wilm's tumour.
 In normal cells the maternal copy of the <i>H19/Igf2</i> cluster expresses <i>H19</i>
because the imprint control region (ICR) is unmethylated and bound by a
CTCF-insulator protein causing the downstream enhancers to act on <i>H19</i> as opposed to <i>Igf2</i>.  The ICR on the paternal copy is methylated, along with <i>H19</i> due to heterochromatin spreading,
which prevents CTCF binding meaning that the downstream enhancers act on <i>Igf2</i>.  In Wilm's tumour the
maternal ICR becomes methylated and acts like the paternal allele, expressing <i>Igf2</i>; as <i>Igf2</i> is a growth promoting gene over expression can cause
tumourigenesis due to uncontrolled growth.<br /></p><i></i></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Decitabine is a DNA
methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor (or DNA-demethylating agent) which halts DNA methylation during
replication; it is a nucleoside inhibitor that is incorporated into the DNA and
irreversibly binds DNMTs like DNMT1 (a maintenance DNMT) preventing them from further methylating the DNA.  Therefore the DNA becomes passively demethylated as replication continues because the new strands of DNA formed during replication will not be methylated by the DNMTs, making the action of Decitabine replication dependent.  Cancer cells are affected more severely by this than normal somatic
cells because they replicate rapidly and so the passive demethylation
progresses faster than it would in normal cells.  If this passive demethylation affects the
genes at the root of the cancer that are methylated (and therefore suppressed), such as it may halt the progression of the cancer (for example if a tumour suppressor gene were reactivated due to the action of the drug).</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome
because it is mitotically heritable; any changes to DNA methylation of a cell
are passed on to daughter cells until removed by active processes.  This can be particularly long lived if
organisms are exposed to factors affecting the epigenome during sensitive
periods throughout development.  While a foetus is in the womb the
epigenome is reprogrammed - and susceptible to environmental changes - during
early development and primordial germ cell development.  The epigenome is also sensitive to changes in
environment in prepubescent children where germ cells are maturing.  Treating patients with epigenetic drugs that
target the epigenome during these stages can have effects not only on the
individual receiving the drug but also on the next generation.  If administered to a pregnant woman her grandchildren
may be affected due to the developing germ cells in the foetus being affected.  Treating any person who may be at one of
these sensitive periods is inadvisable. 
It would also be inadvisable to administer the drugs to young children
due to the potential longevity of any effects; the drug cannot target parts of
the genome but will affect the genome globally, causing potentially negative side-effects.</p></div>
