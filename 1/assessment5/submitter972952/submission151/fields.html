    <h1>Submission 151 from Anon (session_user_id: 54a35dc27335b1ed89de122031018129b97afbe2)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The enzyme called EZH2 attaches methyl groups to histone
proteins, which are part of the chromosomal packaging. In certain cancers of
the immune system, as lymphomas, mutations make EZH2 overactive, which makes more
methylation of  histones than normally, and this silences the genes that this histones surrounds including tumour-suppressor genes(TSG). Normally, TSG controll cell growth. If TSG are silenced cells growth uncontrolled, cancer may be produced.</p><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, used to treat
myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. It demetilates 
hypermetylated histones, so it stop the silencing of Tumor-supressor genes,
restablishing controlled cell growth.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer, there is a reversal of the pattern of the normal
cell: </p><p>1. In normal cells CpG
islands tend to be protected from methylation. </p><p>Methylated DNA  can be bound by methyl-CpG-binding domain
proteins. MBD proteins recruit  histone
deacetylases,  to form heterochromatin.</p><p>In cancer CpG
islands are hypermethylated. At CpG islands, hypermethylation lead to silencing
of tumor suppressor genes, which causes cells dividing more rapidly than its
neighbouring, advantage them in competition, and grow into a tumour. </p><p>Hypomethylation of CpG
sites in oncogens results in over-expression of oncogenes within
cancer cells.</p><p>2. Intergenic regions are located
between genes and normally they are noncoding DNA. Contain promoters or enhancers.
They have regulatory functions. At intergenic regions DNA methylation maintains
genomic integrity. </p><p>In cancer,
at intergenic regions, hypomethylation leads to copying errors such as
deletions, insertions and translocations between chromosomes.</p><p>3. In normal cells, at
repetitive elements, DNA methylation silence transcription, then it maintain
genomic integrity or genomic stability, to prevent the mutagenic transposition
to occur.  Recombination  doesnt happen because repeats
are heavily methylated and heterchromatonized. Recombination needs not
only genetic  genetic similarity, but also open
chromatin,  euchromatin. Otherwise, the DNA is too
densely  packaged and recombination cannot occur. </p><p>


































</p><p>In cancer, repetitive
elements are hypomethylated, so they can transpose or retrotranspose, and
transposable elements are mutagenic: inserts into other gen an disable it,
leave a gen and the gap is not repaired, and duplicates. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>In the
IGF2/H19  cluster the imprint
control region is methylated on the
paternal  allele, and unmethylated on the
maternal allele.</span></p>

<p>On
the maternal allele, as the ICR is unmethylated, CTCF binds its insulator
element, and the  enhancers act on H19.
Igf2 is silent for the maternal  allele,
so don't express.</p>

<p>On the
paternal allele, as ICR is  methylated,
the enhancers can act on IGF2, because CTCF is not  binding to inhibit this, and IGF2 is expressed from the pattern allele.</p>

<p>The
imprinted IGF2 allele is normally active only when inherited from the father.
The imprinted allele for the IGF2 inhibitor is active only when inherited from
the mother. The paternally imprinted IGF2 and the maternally imprinted inhibitor
work in an antagonistic fashion, and a balance between the two is required for
normal development.</p>

<p>In Wilm's
tumour there is hypermethylation  of the
imprint control region also on the 
maternal allele. Then, this maternal allele also  express Igf2. The consequence is that there is a double dose of Igf2, which is growth
promoting, in  comparison to normal  cells. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic mark. Altered DNA methylation have enduring effects on the epigenome,
because it is copied mitotically. When the DNA is replicated, only the parent
strand maintains the methyl group within the CPG dinucleotide. The daughter
strand have an unmethylated cytosine. The DNA methyltransferase enzyme DNMT1, specifically
recognize hemi-methylated DNA, then hemi-methylated DNA bound DNMT1 and DNMT1 methylates
the daughter strand and restores a fully methlayted CPG di-nucleotide.</p><p>Sensitive periods are those when environment changes have the biggest effect: during germ cell development, and early embryonic development, when there is active remodeling. <br /></p><p>Both sex have identical early stages of germ cell development, so early disruptions of epigenetic state impair fertility of males and females, and altered  gamete epigenotype cause transgenerational epigenetic inheritance.<br /></p>














<p>DNA methylation inhibitors cause enzimatically global DNA methylation inhibition, beneficial as tumor suppressor genes are
hypermethylated in cancer, but hypomethylation may lead to
activation of oncogenes, increased genomic instability, activating promoters within repetitive elements.</p><p>Epigenetic drugs are systemically used, so every cell can be affected. They  must not be prescribed to pregnant mothers and before conception, as reprogramming happens in early child development, and during both male and female gametes formation.</p>
