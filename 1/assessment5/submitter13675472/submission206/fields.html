    <div class="field-value">     In normal cells, 60% of gene promotors have CpG islands which are normally free of methylation, keeping them in an active state.  In cancer, there is locus-specific hyper-methylation of promotors of tumor suppressor genes( TSG).  This silences the TSGs and may lead to the formation of repressive chromatin structure as a result of the addition of other epigenetic marks activated by DNA methylation.  The loss of function of TSG- these are often genes involved in controlling growth factors, in initiating apoptosis or cell senescence, or in regulating cell cycle activity in other ways- can unleash the uncontrolled growth and "immortality" of cancer cells.<br />     In normal cells, intergenic/repetitive regions have methylated DNA. In intergenic regions, the methylation acts to silence cryptic promoters which, if active, could alter expression of nearby genes.  Its role is silencing transcriptional interference in normal gene expression.<br />     Repetitive elements, called long terminal repeats(LTR) are on either side of transposible elements in the genome.  LTRs often contain strong promoters.  When active, transposons can move throughout the genome, causing deletions, insertions,  transpositions, and illegitimate chromosome recombinations.  All these disruptions can alter normal gene expression by direct action on other genes or by altering chromatin structure.  Silencing of LTRs by methylation decreases the activity of transposible elements and contributes to genomic stability.<br />     In cancer, repetitive elements and intergenic regions are part of the genome wide hypo-methylation of DNA.  Hypo-methylation here is associated with increased activity of the regions.  Activity of intergenic regions, causing transcriptional interference, and activity of promotors in LTR, causing genomic instability can result in abnormal expression of genes ( increased expression of oncogenes and/or decreased expression of tumor suppressor genes).<br />     <br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">     Imprinted genes, active in the embryo very often, are among those that may be improperly epigenetically marked in cancer. If they are active in the adult, or inappropriately active in the embryo, cancer may result.  The later is the case in Wilms' tumor caused by faulty imprinting at the H19/Igf2 locus.<br />     In this locus, the ICR (imprint control region) of the maternal genome is normally un-methylated; in the paternal genome it is methylated.  The insulator protein, CTCF, can bind only to the un-methylated ICR.   . Enhancer proteins, downstream of H19 and the unmethylated ICR, are directed to H19 and away from the Igf2 gene. In the paternal allele, the methylated ICR 1.) prevents binding of CTCF and 2.) allows spreading of the methylation to the Hi9 gene, silencing it.  The enhancer proteins are free to act on the Igf2 gene, resulting in expression of the gene and production of Igf2, an insulin-like growth factor.<br />     In Wilms' Tumor,  there is bi-allelic  methylation of the ICR ("two paternal alleles"), resulting in overproduction of Igf2. An inappropriate level of IGf2  is oncogenic.  Interestingly, we may consider inactivation of H19 as the loss of a TSG too.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">     Decitabine is a DNA de-methylating agent; specifically it inhibits DNMT1.  Lack of activity of DNMT1 results in passive de-methylation of DNA in replicating cells.   <br />     Since CpG islands in promoters of tumor suppressor genes (TSG) are hyper-methylated in cancer cells, de-methylation of the CpG islands of these cells would move them back to the more normal methylation state.  The TSG, turned off by hyper-methylation, would be switched back on.<br />   The drug itself has no specificity of target; it would affect all cells.  However since a characteristic of cancer cells is their rapid, often uncontrolled growth.  This growth characteristic of cancer cells is often exploited therapeutically.   Decitabine, de-methylating passively, would affect cancer cells to a disproportionately high degree. <br />     Decitabine's effect on repetitive/intergenic regions of hypo-methylated cancer DNA could be to exacerbate genomic instability and transcriptional interference and may account for some side effects of the drug.<br /> <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">     DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epi-genome because it is the least reversible of epigenetic marks.  Only TET enzymes can actively demethylate DNA; DNMT1 ensures mitiotic heritability of this epigenetic mark.<br />     A sensitive period is one in which epigenetic marks are actively removed and reset in normal cells. In gestation, there are 2 sensitive periods.  The first is during the pre-implantation phase, from fertilization to formation of the blastocyst.  The second, formation of primordial germ cells, occurs mid-gestation.  There are also periods of remodeling in which specific cell lineages are programmed for development. A specific case of this is in the pre-pubescent period in which gametes are maturing.<br />     During these sensitive periods, because the epi-genome is being remodeled  it is very sensitive to environmental effects on the specific marks being removed and put down. Use of epigenetic drugs is an environmental effect which has great potential to alter the erasure and re-setting of normal epigenetic marks.  The drugs themselves could easily be carcinogenic or cause changes from the normal epi-genome which could lead to an abnormal phenotype<br /></div>
