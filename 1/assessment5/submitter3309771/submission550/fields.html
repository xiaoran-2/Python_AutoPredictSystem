    <h1>Submission 550 from Anon (session_user_id: eac4bfd3413647bef4478a90f058aff406eb1f0f)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Methylation of the promoter upstream of a gene can affect the expression of the gene and silence it. By administering drugs that alter the DNA methylation of a patient, we are silencing or activating certain genes leading to the upregulation or downregulation of their expression. The epigenome is effected by an alteration in the DNA methylation as DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. So, we are effecting the expression of the dividing cells and impacting the expression in the daughter cells and hence the epigenome. A sensitive period is the period during which certain epigenetic marks are expressed on the genes based on the exposure to a stimulant or disruptor from the environment and determines what the phenotype or expression in a particular individual would be. Sensitive periods during development include the period post fertilisation and  the period of development of germ cells (gametogenesis) in an organism. Exposure to certain stimulants in the environment during these periods leads to a permanent change in the phenotype of an organism which is mitotically heritable. Treating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable because it can lead to mitotic heritablity of the epigenetic marks which determine the expression of the genes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normal cells, in general have CpG islands that are unmethylated and the introns, repetitive elements and the intergenic regions are methylated. In cancer, CpG are more likely to be methylated, and are found in promotor regions of tumor suppressor genes. By methylating the promoter, the tumor suppressor genes are silenced and since this is mitotically heritable, the hypermethylation is locked down and the expression of tumor suppressor genes is silenced. DNA methylation occurs frequently in tumor genes and these epimutations are selective for the tumor cells and these cells divide more frequently and there is increased methylation as the tumor progresses. In normal cells, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are heavily methylated so that there is genetic stability and there's no extra chromosomes or fewer chromosomes. The alignment among repetitive regions of the repetitive elements need genetic similarity and euchromatin. In cancer cells, the repetitive elements and the intergenic regions are hypomethylated  which leads to illegitimate recombination of repeats.In  Repeats having large repetitive regions, recombination happens within these repeats by alignment of the hypomethylation. The repeats can make copies of themselves and can transpose to different regions of the genome. They can also activate other genes around them (upstream or downstream of the repetitive elements). Disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements leading to their hypomethylation leads to additional insertions and deletions and reciprocal translocations in the genome.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the paternal allele, the Imprint control region (ICR) is methylated and is not bound by CTCF. The the enhancers won't be able to act on H19 and there's expression of Igf2. In the maternal allele, the Imprint control region (ICR) is unmethylated and is bound by CTCF and the enhancers will be able to act on H19 and there's no expression of Igf2. However, in WIlm's tumor, both the maternal and paternal alleles, the ICRs  are methylated (hypermethylated) and hence the CTCF is unable to bind to the insulator and the enhancers are unable to act on H19 and there's a double expression of Igf2 from both the alleles. Hypermethylation of the Imprint control regions of the Igf2/H19 leads to a loss of imprinting which may be related back to the preneoplastic tissue and may be very early events in the formation of tumors.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. Decitabine inhibits the activity of the DNA methyl transferase and is approved by FDA to treat acute myelodysplastic syndrome which progresses to AML. Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue which actes by getting incorporated into the DNA and after getting incorporated, it binds to DNMT1 irreversibly. The DNMT1 is bound and cannot be released leading to demethylation of the CpG islands. In rapidly dividing cancer cells, DNMT1 is bound and cannot lead to methylation. Decitabine is not specific to cancer cells and causes DNA demethylation.  Myelodysplastic syndrome has a characteristic hypermethylation of CpG islands and hence, treatment with Decitabine leads to demethylation of these islands.</div>
