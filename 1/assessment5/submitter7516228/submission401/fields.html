    <div class="field-value">CpG’s are found at CPG islands near gene promoters. Overall CpG’s are not methylated but when methylated they cause silencing of that gene expression. This is primarily by methylated CpG binding proteins known as MeCP1 and MeCP2 binding methylated CPGs to alter transcription through a transcriptional repression domain and finally cause chromatin condensation. Alternatively methylated CpGs stop transcription factor binding  &amp; prevent gene transcription.<br />In normal cells, CPG islands are hypomethylated whereas the repetitive elements at the intergenic regions and in the introns of genes are methylated. In cancer cells, the CpG islands are methylated (CGI hypermethylation) but the repetitive elements in the intergenic regions and introns are hypomethylated. <br />If CPG islands near tumor suppressor gene promoters are methylated causing gene expression silencing, which being mitotically heritable, silences genes in future cell generations. Knudson hypothesis proposes that tumorogenesis occurs when multiple hits such as DNA methylation silencing of both copies of tumor suppressor genes  and oncogene activation causes cells to multiply and survive. These epimutations have competitive advantage over other cells and are selected for causing cancer. <br />The genome has intergenic intervals or repetitive 
elements where the CpGs are methylated in a normal cell but hypomethylated in cancer cells. <br />DNA
 methylation normally maintains genomic stability preventing loss or gain or illegitimate recombinations between chromosomes.<br />In a normal cell, repeat  methylation prevents recombination and they are heterochromatinized. Recombination normally can only 
happen between regions with genetic identity. <br />In cancer hypomethylation of repetitive elements &amp; intergenic regions causes mis-alignments and recombinations between large 
identical tracts in repeats or reciprocal translocations 
between two different chromosomes with repeat alignment as they are not densely packed into heterochromatin or activated because of hypomethylation and then transpose and disrupt gene coding regions or activate neighboring genes.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Genomic imprinting refers to mono-allelic gene expression from one of the two parental alleles in a parent-of-origin specific manner. DNA methylation of  imprint control region (ICR) controls expression of surrounding imprinted genes. A paternally imprinted gene is methylated on the paternal ICR, but not on the maternal ICR.<br />Normally at the Igf2H19 cluster the ICR is methylated on the paternal allele. Because CTCF is not causing inhibitory binding, enhancers 
can act on IGF2 to express it from the pattern allele.<br />Concurrently the ICR is un-methylated on the maternal allele, so CTCF binds the insulator element and enhancers act on H19, but Igf2 is silent for the maternal allele. <br />Imprinted genes are involved in growth either as growth promoters or growth suppressors.<br />Cancer
 cells lose this imprinting through hypermethylation or hypomethylation of imprint control 
regions. Hence they are expressed or silent from both parental alleles. <br />At the Igf2H19 cluster loss of imprinting with hypermethylation of the ICR on the maternal allele causes expression of Igf2 which adds to that expressed from the paternal allele. This double dose of growth promoting Igf2 is associated with Wilms’ tumor. <br />Wide array of tumors show loss of imprinting as an early event in pre-neoplastic tissues. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTI) is approved for use in myelodysplastic syndrome that has progressed to Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and under clinical trials for solid malignancies.<br />Decitabine being a nucleoside analog gets incorporated into DNA on replication, and when DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1) binds that nucleotide to copy methylation to the daughter strand, it is bound irreversibly and cannot be released. Hence these division dependent DNMTi act on rapidly replicating cells like cancer cells.<br />Formerly the DNMTi were used at very high doses causing toxicity. At much lower doses,  they cause DNA methylation and thereby anti-neoplastic effect but since they affect all dividing cells the long term consequences on normal cells are unknown. <br />Heavy CpG island hypermethylation indicates poorer prognosis for myelodysplastic syndrome and older patients in their 70s tolerate and  respond extremely well to the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors and have an improved life expectancy with reduced side effects.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">On DNA replication, parent strands maintain CPG 
dinucleotide methylation whereas daughter strands have unmethylated cytosines. 
DNA methyltransferase enzyme 1 (DNMT1) recognizes hemi-methylated DNA, 
binds to it and methylates daughter strands thereby restoring the methlayted CPG dinucleotide. Thereby at every cell division DNA
 methylation is copied by DNMT1 onto daughter DNA strands to ensure DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic mark. Drugs altering DNA methylation pass on such alteration to daughter cells &amp; have enduring genomic effects long after completing drug treatment.<br />There is generalized reprogramming between generations through two phases of epigenetic reprogramming to wipe off marks laid down in one lifetime in the somatic cells to ensure totipotency in subsequent generations. The first is during pre-implantation development, and second is during primordial germ cell development. These two are sensitive periods when epigenetic reprogramming is occurring and environmental changes have the biggest effect . Beyond the mid-gestation embryo, except in primoridial germ cells, there somatic maintenance of the 
epigenetic marks that were established in a lineage specific way post 
implantation.<br />Treating patients during sensitive periods causes epigenetic disruption, imprint disorders &amp; large changes in genome-wide transcription of genes in surviving clones and  is inadvisable in younger patients, with developing germ cells.<br /></div>
