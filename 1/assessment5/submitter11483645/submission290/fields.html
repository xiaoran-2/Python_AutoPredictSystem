    <div class="field-value">Cancer cells are characterised by a loss of DNA methylation throughout the genome, with some localised gain.<br /><br />In normal cells, DNA methylation is generally seen genome-wide, but CpG islands tend to be hypomethylated. CpG islands can frequently be seen at promoters of tumour suppressor genes, which means that under normal conditions, when they are unmethylated, they can be expressed to prevent unregulated growth. By contrast, in cancer some of the CpG islands are hypermethylated, and the tumour suppressor genes are therefore silenced. Because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, the silencing of the tumour suppressor genes continues after successive cell divisions. As a result, cell cycle control, apoptosis and DNA repair are all impaired and rampant growth can ensue.<br /><br />As tumours progress, methylation of CpG islands increases. The pattern of hypermethylation of CpG islands (and even more of the surrounding island shores) is often characteristic of cancer types/sub-types and cancer stage and can serve as a biomarker, which can help with cancer diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. This applies particularly in CIMP, where hypermethylation of sets of CpG islands is present in several different cancers (each cancer with its own characteristic set), which provides particularly strong biomarkers.<br /><br />In normal cells, DNA methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to genome stability by suppressing transposition of the repetitive elements, possible translocations and interference with nearby gene expression from strong promoters present in repetitive regions, as well as by condensing the chromatin in those regions, i.e. by formation of localised heterochromatin. In cancer, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are generally unmethylated, which opens up the chromatin to some extent. Repeats can be activated and copy themselves. This contributes to genomic instability (mismatching, deletions, insertions, translocations, aberrant chromosome numbers), leading to interference with normal gene expression. Some cancers are driven by instability.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normally, the H19/Igf2 cluster is paternally imprinted; the imprint control region for this cluster on the paternal allele is methylated, and this DNA methylation spreads to the H19 gene, therefore the paternal H19 gene is blocked. As a result of methylation of the imprint control region, downstream enhancers are free to activate their preferred gene, the Igf2, which is an oncogene, a growth promoter. <br /><br />The imprint control region on the maternal allele is unmethylated and covered by an insulator protein, CTCF. This blocks access of downstream enhancers to their preferred target, Igf2, and the downstream enhancers have to act on H19 instead, so that the long noncoding RNA is expressed from the maternal allele. <br /><br />Loss of imprinting occurs in many different tumours at an early stage. In Wilm's tumour, the imprint control region on both paternal and maternal alleles is methylated. The normally unmethylated imprint control region on the maternal allele is now hypermethylated, CTCF is missing, and the associated Igf2 gene is now also expressed; as a result there is double expression of Igf2, both from the paternal and maternal alleles, so that the cell has twice the normal expression of this growth gene. The result is Wilm's tumour.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue. It is a DNA demethylating agent, i.e. it can remove methyl groups.<br /><br />As a nucleoside analogue, Decitabine can insert itself into the DNA strand, and after cell replication, when DNA methyltransferase 1 comes along to methylate the new daughter strand, it binds irreversibly by covalent bond to Decitabine, i.e. it cannot get released any more. Because tumour cells divide more rapidly, they incorporate more of this drug and are therefore affected more by this.<br /><br />Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect if the cancer is driven by tumour suppressor hypermethylation, but <strong>not</strong> if it's due to chromosomal instability. <strong></strong>At the correct dose and at the correct stage Decitabine allows the re-expression of tumour suppressor genes by removing the DNA methylation from the gene promoter and its surrounding regions, thereby halting or reducing tumour growth. The reduction in hypermethylation can also stimulate immune responses. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation affects the structure of chromatin, whether genes are expressed, and the allele from which genes are expressed. Heavily methylated areas of DNA tend to be heterochromatinised, i.e. the genes in those regions are not expressed. In more accessible areas of chromatin, methylation of gene promoters/genes generally prevents expression of that gene, and vice versa. In normal cell function only a subset of genes are expressed, and that is highly regulated. Altering DNA methylation affects the functioning of the cell. The wrong gene products are produced and ill health results. Because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, this faulty function continues.<br /><br />Epigenetically sensitive periods are those times when epigenetic marks need to be cleared or laid down. This happens in early embryonic development (after fertilisation and before implantation), during embryonic primordial germ cell development, as well as in young people when oocytes or sperm mature, and also, in terms of drug treatment, prior to and during pregnancy generally.<br /><br />Treating patients during sensitive periods could lead to faulty patterns of epigenetic control of gene expression. All epigenetic regulation in all cells can be affected. During sensitive times the patterns of healthy cellular function are set - drugs could interfere.</div>
