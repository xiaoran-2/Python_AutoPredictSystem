    <div class="field-value">Normally DNA is non-methylated in CpG islands. In cancer cells CpG islands are often hypermethylated, leading to silencing tumor suppressor genes.And it's occures more frequent than genetic mutations (e.g. RB hypermethylation leads to retinoblastoma).Alterations in DNA methylation at ICRs (either hypo- or hypermethylation) can lead to silencing growth-restricting and expression of growth-promoting genes. Normally intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated. In cancer cells they are hypomethylated leading to genomic instability due to illegitimate recombinations between repeats, activation and transposition of repeats, activation of cryptic promoters with disruption of adjacent genes. Hypomethylated chromatin is less densely packed which can cause more instability and more possibilities for deletions, duplications and reciprocal translocations, therefore leading to cancer.  Hypomethylation of CpG-poor promoters can activate proto-oncogenes (R-RAS) or activate miRNA that target tumor suppressor genes leading to tumorogenesis in the cell.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In cancer cells both hyper- and hypomethylation can lead to loss of imprinting, as a result, some genes become expressed from both paternal and maternal alleles (overexpression), or some genes become silent from both parents. For example, in H19/Igf2 cluster: in normal cell mathernal allele Imprint control Region (ICR) is unmethylated, enhancers act on H19 gene and  Igf2 gene is silent. In normal paternal allele - ICR and H19 are methylated,  enhancers act on Igf2 and this gene is expressed. Hypermethylation of ICR  leads to Igf2 become expressed on maternal alleleand the cell have double dosage of this gene.Since Igf2 is a growth-promoting gene, double dose of it activates cell growth, it becomes uncontrollable and leads to cancer. Loss of imprinting  of the Igf2 gene is known in Wilm's tumor, where Igf2 is activated in both paternal and maternal alleles. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to DNA-demethylating class of epigenetic inhibitors. In many cancers there is an overmethylation of histones, which leads to silencing the genes surrounded by these histones, including tumor-suppressor genes. By inhibiting the activity of methyltransferase, Decitabine is causing histone (and DNA) hypomethylation. This reduced methylation resultis in activation of genes, important for control of cellular differentiation and proliferation, promoting natural cell death (apoptosis). Tumor suppressor genes also become activated. Combination of DNA methylation inhibitors and histone-deacetylase inhibitors slows tumor growth in some tumors (leukemia, lymphoma, lung cancer).</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Because epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable, they are passed on during cell division to daughter cells, and then to granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Therefore, DNA methylation, as epigenetic factor, can have enduring effect on the genome; and drugs altering DNA methylation can have long lasting effect even after treatment. During sensitive periods of epigenetic reprogramming (during germ cells development and early development when paternal and maternal epigenetic marks are erased) it's inadvisable to treat patients with epigenetic-modifiers because of erasing and reprogramming of epigenetic marks. After these marks are established, treatment can be effective and long lasting.</div>
