    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"> Decitabine is a DNA
de-methylating agent that inhibits DNA methyltransferase, resulting in a
reduction in DNA methylation. It is similar in its actions to azacitidine and another chemical analogue of
cytosine. The role of DNA methylation
is cancer is very context dependant. Some tumors are driven by inhibition of tumour
supressors genes through the hypermethylation of the attached CpG islands, in
these cases reducing DNA methylation would be of benefit. However in other
cases the increase in genomic instability and alterations in gene regulation
caused by reducing DNA methylation would be detrimental. What class a tumor
falls into may changes during its development



providing sensitivity periods where Decitabine would be more or less effective.  <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>In general in normal cell methylation
occurs in the intergenic regions between genes, in the intronic regions of
genes and at repetitive elements with CpG islands being hypo-methylated. CpG islands are associated with gene promoter regions and play a role in tissue specific regulation. Methylation
contributes to genomic stability as it helps prevent crossover events occurring
between repetitive elements that have high sequence identity by hypermethylating
and hetrochromatinising these regions thus preventing these regions binding.
Some of these repeats are transposable elements, which can copy themselves and
then insert these copies throughout the genome. Hypomethylation of these
regions, which is commonly seen in cancer, make both of these events more
likely to occur, potentially result in the disruption of genes and gene
regulation. The loss of DNA methylation can also result in changes in gene
regulation, for example the hypomethylation of the poor promoter for the
microRNA miR21 increases its production resulting in a decrease in the
availability of its target the tumour suppressor PTEN.  Another common feature of cancer is an increases
in methylation at some CpG islands. These CpG islands are often located in the
promoters of tumour suppression genes resulting in the inactivation of these
genes.</span>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>A common feature of
cancer is changes in methylation at Imprint Control Regions (ICRs). Imprinted
genes are often involved in growth. For example the expression of long
non-coding RNA H19 and the Insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2) are closely
linked. In normal cells they are subject to imprinting and have a parent of
origin effect.  The maternal chromosome
is un-methylated at the control region between the two genes, which allows the
binding of CTCF a insulator protein that insulates Igf2 from downstream
enhancers.  As a result the enhancers
instead stimulate the expression of H19. Conversely on the paternal chromosome this
region is methylated which prevents the binding of CTCF and allows expression
of Igf2 but the spread of DNA methylation across this region also causes the
methylation and thus silencing of H19. This results in Igf2 being expressed
only from the paternally inherited chromosome and H19 from the maternal. In
Wilm’s tumours this imprinting is lost and both copies of this region are
un-methylated, resulting in the over expression of Igf2, which is a growth
factor and contributes to the uncontrolled replication seen in cancer. </span>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic marks are mitotically
heritable so will be maintained through subsequent cell divisions. This means treatment
with a drug that inhibits histone-deacetylase and DNA methyltransferase
<span>(Dnmt) and thus inhibit the transfer and maintenance of
these marks will have effects that out last the treatment period could result
in permanent alterations to the gene expression patterns of the treated cells.
This could result in a tumour having an altered sensitivity to subsequent drug
treatments. Epigenetic regulation is essential for normal development, through
X-inactivation, tissue specific gene regulation, ect.  </span></p>

<p>Therefore exposure to drugs that
inhibit DNA methylation and histone regulation would be far more detrimental
during these sensitivity periods during development and early life when these
epigenetic marks are being lain down than during periods when methylation is
simply being maintained. Periods when gametes are being produced would also be likely to be particularly sensitive and could have transgenerational effects.<br /></p>
