    <div class="field-value">   CpG islands are often found at
     promoters of genes and tend to be protected from methylation to allow gene
     expression (some exceptions are seen when methylated CpGs can cause expression of certain genes). While most CpG islands are found in the active state, some, for instance associated with oncogenes, do not follow the general rule and are heavily methylated. These particular CpG islands are then preventing expression of some detrimental genes, which for the normal functioning of the cell should be silent.<br />   The normal state mentioned above is not a constant and some disruptions may be introduced leading to an inversion of the normal state. In these cases what we see in a hypermethylation of the CpG islands which leads to a underexpression of factors that prevent wild growth and replication of genes. When this happens, combined with several other factors, cells will start to grow and replicate without considering its surroundings and developing a tumor.<br /><br />    In contradiction to the previous situation, intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be hypermethylated. These regions are non-coding regions present in the genome which are permanently silent. In cancer, these regions get gradually demethylated  and cause <span>
     In case of cancer, these regions are hypomethylated and able to interact
     with their environment. This creates genomic instability through several
     mechanims: a) illegitimate recombination between repeats leading to wrong
     crossing-over between non-paired chromosomes, b) activation of repeats and
     transposition resulting in truncated transcription as well as c) activation
     of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes. Together this
     will lead to silencing of tumor suppressor and growth restriction gene
     and thus facilitate cancer.</span>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span><span>    In the paternal allele the
ICR associated with lgf2 is methylated and so the nearby enhancers will stimulate the </span>expression of lgf2 to which they have preference. In
the maternal allele this ICR is not methylated. This allows the protein CTCF to bind and blocks the preferential action of the enhancers onto lgf2 and so they stimulate the expression of H19. These methylation states are passed from parents to offspring according to the parent gender and so are stable.<br />    In Wilm's tumor these ICRs on both alleles
are methylated which leads to an over-expression of lgf2 and silencing of H19.
Taking into consideration that lgf2 is a growth promotor and H19 a growth
restricting gene, the over-expression of the first and silencing of the second
will lead to cell overgrowth and division causing a tumor.</span><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><span class="_wysihtml5-temp"></span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>    Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent and is used to treat myelosplastic syndromes.
As a demethylating agent it removes methyl groups from the DNA and opens the chromatin by reducing the strength of the DNA-histone interaction. Many tumors
have hypermethylated CpG islands, which results in gene silencing of tumor
suppressor genes and growth restriction genes. Through the action of Decitabine,
these CpG islands will be demethylated and, so reactivated, leading to the tumor suppressor genes and
growths restriction genes to be expressed. Through this expression, the cells will
not grow and divide in a exaggerated fashion and so the tumors growth will be stopped or reduced.</span><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">    Most epigenetic marks
are established during two particular stages of development: germ cell
development and pre-implantation development. During these stages either the
environment or human manipulation, e.g. by creating a higher availability of
methyl groups through diet, can affect the establishment of the epigenetic marks and so creating a more close chromatin structure. Since
epigenetic marks are mitotically inheritable - meaning they pass<span> through the somatic line
till the end of an individual's life - any alteration induced during the
sensitive periods will be maintained.<br />    Drugs that interplay with the epigenome are non-specific, therefore they do
not only target diseased cells or altered methylations, but the whole genome in the whole individual.
Consequently, a drug treatment during the sensitive periods would result in a disruption of not only the disrupted marks, but also of the normal
epigenetic marks.</span><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
