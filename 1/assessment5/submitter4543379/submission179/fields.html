    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is universally abnormal in cancer cells, which can result either in hypermethylation or hypomethylation, depending on the specific locus and cell type. In normal cells, CpG islands are generally protected from methylation, unless a gene is being silenced, since the methylation of CpG islands is associated with chromatin condensation, and thus silencing. In cancer, CGI hypermethylation is apparent throughout the genome and promotes unmitigated proliferation when found in the promoter region of a tumor suppressor, such as BRCA1 or MGMT, leading to cancer. In addition to hypermethylation, cancer cells experience hypomethylation of repetitive elements and intergenic regions, areas that are usually heavily methylated. In the normal state, these regions are methylated, condensed, and inactive, creating genome stability. When the methylation is absent, genomic instability results through illegitimate recombinations, activation of repeats and transposons, activation of cryptic promoters, and disruption to neighboring genes. The results of recombinations and transposon activity can lead directly to genomic mutations, an example of epigenetics affecting the actual genetic code. In addition, the aberrant gene expression from transcriptional changes that can result from genomic instability shows an epigenetic mechanism of cancer promotion, showing how both genetic mutations and epigenetic abnormalities can qualify as Knudson "hits", many of which add up to create a cancerous cell.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the H19/Igf3 cluster of a normal cell, the imprint control region (ICR) is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele, making it paternally imprinted. On the unmethylated, maternal strand, CTCF binds to the ICR and acts as an insulator protein, blocking the Igf2 gene from downstream enhancers, thereby silencing its activity. This leaves the enhancers to act only on H19, a long noncoding RNA. On the paternal allele, however, the ICR is methylated and CTCF cannot bind, leaving the enhancers to act on Igf2, a growth promoting oncogene. This proper functioning results in limited Igf2 expression, since it is only expressed from the paternal allele, and therefore controlled growth. In Wilm's tumor, the ICRs on both the maternal and paternal alleles are methylated. This hypermethylation results in a double dose of Igf2 expression. Since Igf2 is a growth promoting gene, this overexpression contributes to the unmitigated growth typical of cancer cells.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">With the growing body of research on epigenetic contributions to cancer have come attempts to target the dysfunctional epigenetic machinery. Drugs that are seeing success target enzymatic epigenetic regulators, since small molecular inhibitors seem to be the most effective means to alter or reverse epigenetic marks. DNMT1 is responsible for the majority of methylation in the genome and, since hypermethylation is a significant contributor to the out-of-control growth indicative of cancer cells, targeting its action has proven fruitful in fighting certain types of cancers. Decitabine is a DNMT1 inhibitor used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). It incorporates itself into DNA by binding to DNMT1, and blocks DNMT1 from hypermethylation, for both de novo and maintenance methylation. It is replication dependent, but once it produces its hypomethylation results, it blocks the unmitigated growth seen in cancer cells with surprisingly minimal influence on normal cell lines.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">During cell division, DNMT1 has an affinity for hemi-methylated DNA. It recognizes the newly coupled DNA strands that have only the maternal strand methylated and lays down methylation on the daughter strand, making DNA methylation, as other epigenetic marks, mitotically heritable. Thus, when epigenetic drugs add or remove methylation in cancer cells, the cells return to a more normal functionality, which is then passed down throughout successive cell division cycles. It is important to consider times when this alteration of DNA methylation may be more destructive, such as in sensitive periods, periods in which epigenetic marks are being laid or re-laid on a large scale in normal differentiation and development. These include a period in early embryonic development, as well as the clearing of epigenetic marks during primordial germ cell development. There is also evidence that early childhood may be a sensitive period. Since there is greater epigenetic plasticity during these times, it is believed (and, indeed there is some evidence) that treatment with methylating or demethylating agents may disrupt more than just abnormal cancerous lines and have lasting, possibly deleterious, effects on the epigenetic marks that define normal cellular function in sensitive tissues.<br /></div>
