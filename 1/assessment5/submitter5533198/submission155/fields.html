    <div class="field-value">In general methylation of CpG islands that are located in the promotors of genes is an epigenetic way to silence genes: methylation of a genes promotor can inhibit expression of the gene by preventing transcription factors from binding to the DNA. In normal cells CpG islands in promotor regions are usually unmethylated. In cancer cells CpG islands are often hypermethylated, i.e. more methylated than in normal cells. These methylated CpG islands in cancer cells are often located at the promotors of tumor suppressor genes. Methylation leads to silencing of these suppressor genes such that tumor growth is not suppressed by these genes anymore.<br /><br />In normal cells intergenic regions and repetitive elements are often methylated. In cancer cells intergenic regions and repetetive elements are often hypomethylated, i.e. less methylated than in normal cells. There are multiple ways how this can effect tumor growth. If the hypomethylated genes are for example part of a CpG poor promotor of an oncogene, hypomethylation might lead to activation of oncogenes. Another point is that methylation gives DNA regions some stability and hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetetive elements in general can lead to genomic instability. This means that translocations, insertions and deletions are more likely to occur. These mutations can then enhance tumor growth.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The imprint control region (ICR) of the H19/Igf2 cluster is paternally imprinted, i.e. it is methylated in the paternal allele and unmethylated in the maternal allele.<br />On the maternal allele the unmethylated ICR can bind CTCF, an insulator protein insulating Igf2 from downstream enhancers (these enhancers normally favor binding to Igf2 over binding to H19). When the enhancers cannot access Igf2 they instead act on H19 and enhance the expression of H19.<br />On the paternal allele the methylated ICR cannot bind CTCF hence the enhancers can act on Igf2. Threfore Igf2 is expressed only from the paternal allele. H19 is not expressed from the paternal allele since the methylation of the ICR can spread downstream to the H19 promotor region silencing H19.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumor (kidney cancer) imprinting is disrupted and both alleles behave like the paternal allele hence Igf2 (growth promoting oncogene) is overexpressed and H19 (probably tumor suppressing?, see <a title="Link: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8827077" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8827077">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8827077</a>) is less expressed.<br /><br />Interestingly the contrary imprinting disruption seems to play a role in different cancer types, too (see <a title="Link: http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/56/3/480.full.pdf" href="http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/56/3/480.full.pdf">http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/56/3/480.full.pdf</a> where the authors found loss of imprinting associated with H19 overexpression for example in esophageal cancer). So the role of H19 seems to depend on the tumor type.<br /><br /><br /><a href="http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/56/3/480.full.pdf"></a><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase.<br /><br />In some cancer cells a progressing hypermethylation of CpG islands in the promotors of tumor suppressor genes or a hypermethylation of histone proteins attached to the DNA close to tumor suppressor genes can be observed. Treatment with Decitabine, an agent inhibiting DNA methyltransferase, might slow down the methylation of the CpG islands and/or the histones and therefore tumor suppressor genes are not silenced.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs altering DNA methylation might have an effect that lasts beyond the time of treatment because the methylation status of a cell does not have to change back after treatment (epigenetic changes are reversible but they are not automatically reversed after treatment) and further epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable. So even after cell division the epigenetic changes caused by treatment might still be present in daughter cells and so on.<br /><br />Treating patients in sensitive periods (e.g. younger persons developing germ cells or pregnant women during early development of their embryo) is not advisible since in these periods epigenetic reprogramming (epigenetic marks are reset) takes place. If patients are treated in these periods disruptions of the normal epigenetic reprogramming (for example imprinting) are very likely to occur and might cause bad side effects.<br /><br /></div>
