    <div class="field-value"><b>      Cancer </b>is attributed often to particular <strong>abnormal</strong> <strong>alteration</strong>s in an organism's <strong>epigenetic state</strong>. Normal  states of  dinucleotide CG-pairs capable of being methylated  (<strong>CpG islands</strong>) are found throughout the genome and <strong>become characteristically inverted from a normal state</strong>. Depending on the region and configurations of the DNA superstructures, methylation information can alter organizations of the genome, contributing to, as well as directly increased expression activity, or varying to complete silencing of genes. <br />     CpG located in promoter regions of genes are often not methylated.  With cancer, they are, and hence become silenced. There are exceptions for genes that are intended to be silenced, serving only in embryonic development stages, or  to strictly regulated, which in the cancer state can become active. When CpG sites in promoters  become methylated, they can be thought of as blocking polymerase from binding and thus structurally discourages the gene's expression. <strong>Intergenic</strong> areas of CpG, are normally found methylated, but in cancer are <strong>decreasingly</strong> found. It's thought, unimportant intergenic areas not involved in the gene code itself, are best left silenced and not confounding with excess random messages. These also are changed in cancer.<br />     Another part of genomes where methylation is important are  <strong>REPEATS,</strong> and <strong>Transposons.</strong> These areas, if not tightly controlled, by their nature,  jump out of position and relocate in random places in the genome. This is good for varying antigen composition but can wreck havoc when uncontrollably interfering randomly in important genes. When methylated, these areas are controlled tightly but in <strong>cancer</strong> <strong>states are found unmethylated</strong> and thus their destructive nature can ensue attack.<br />    SImplifying, Cancer, having the above alterations manifests in defective genes or gene regulation by overproduction of oncogenes, and suppression of Tumor suppressors thus replicating cells and  activity without bound, disrupting organisms equilibrium and ultimately become incompatible with life.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"> The H19/Igf2 cluster is an imprint control region that operates through enhancer blocking. When the maternal DNA strand inappropriately becomes methylated and behaves as a paternal strand the following normal function is disrupted. On the <b>MATERNAL </b>strand healthy individuals have an ICR region which attracts a protein called CTCF which can bind on the ICR CpG when unmethylated. The CTCF protein blocks the downstream Enhancers from looping and activating Igf2 a growth promoter (oncogene) and instead functions to promote H19 a long noncoding RNA for other purposes. <br />The <b>PATERNAL</b> strand IS normally<b></b> methylated and that CTCF is blocked, blocking H19 and allowing Igf2 enhancement.The problem arises when maternal is altered becoming methylated and inhibits the CTCF protein from binding like the paternal strand. The methylation at this position spreads further along the chromosome, interferes with the H19, silencing it.  This results in a cancerous double dose of oncogene. Associated very nearby this region is another maternal ICR that when also behaving paternally does not tumor suppress in a double dose. A perfect duo for cancer! This  <b>maternal H9/Igf2 ICR acting as a  paternal ICR</b> often leads a condition called <b>WIlms tumor</b> found in children's kidneys.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"> Decitabine is described in the article as having a class of a DNA-demethylating agent. Upon further investigation i found that it is similar nucleoside analog of cytodine which is similar to cytosine. It is an inhibitor of DNA methyl transferase and results in hypomethylation. This means that DNA would likely not be actively methylated in cells that are rapidly replicating and that  a general shift to a state of hypomethylation in DNA. This demethylation event has its effect by restoring blocked tumor suppressing genes (the methylation was blocking tumor suppressor genes). Functional tumor suppressor genes can now restore  from uncontrolled cell cycling and growth. Considering that Decitabine is similar to cytosine it has the potential to become toxically incorporated into rapidly dividing cells DNA and result in cell death in a similar fashion as one of the first treatment of AIDS patients with the drug AZT.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Dr Baylis speculation is very plausible. Changes in methylation have overwhelmingly been shown to be mitotically heritable and imprinting studies give credibility to meiosis as well. When the term "in some way lasting" way is used, it implies that the "information" is able to be carried on after treatment , newer cells will behave in the treated way and methylation is one such way to achieve that effect as described. Methylation, capable of being preserved through replications as cells divide,is just the sort of thing that could easily be investigated by methylation of aspects of the genome. Many genes are controlled by promoters that directly influence their expression state. Other genes can control rates of gene controller enzymes(transcription factors). Other genes are involved in transposons and repeats that are important in special places where mixing up genetic material is beneficial. Additionally methylation is intricately involved in segregation and shaping of the DNA allowing some genes to be exposed and others hidden.<br />    Sensitive period is a time when an organism is susceptible to clearing of DNA-methylation(reprogramming).  This occurs in the production of gametes or after fertilization preimplantation of  embryos. These periods are critical for development and best left alone until understood comprehensively.</div>
