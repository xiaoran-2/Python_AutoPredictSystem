    <div class="field-value">The cancer epigenome can be characterized in terms of both local hypermethylation and a global hypomethylation signature. Hypermethylation progresses over time at loci such as CpG islands (CGI) that promote for genes that are in opposition to the cancer phenotype. Hypomethylation occurs gradually everywhere else, especially at intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br /><br />In non-cancerous cells, CGI's occur within +/-2kb around the exon and are normally hypomethylated which often results in favourable gene expression, whereas hypermethylation would mean that the genes are silenced. The opposite is true for specific CGI promoters in cancer where promoters of tumour suppressors, such as tp53, are usually hypermethylated. This silencing of anti-proliferative and anti-tumour genes, usually in concert with other epigenetic and genetic regulation, strongly aids the proliferation of tumours. Often, this hypermethylation may correspond to cancer metastasis.  <br /><br />On the other hand, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally hypermethylated in non-cancerous cells. These genome regions mostly represent noncoding and parasitic gene elements, that may have been progressively silenced throughout evolution. In some cases, these may represent the necessary boundary elements, including insulators, which are required for the shielding of otherwise cross-interfering transcription events. Hence, the maintained silencing of such regions by hypermethylation is required for overall genome integrity and stability in normal cells. <br /><br />Hence in cancer these regions are progressively hypomethylated, leading to widespread genomic instability, because their transcription may lead to transcription errors such as deletions, translocations, transcription of potentially deleterious endogeneous retroviral elements, undesirable ncRNA's, gene imprinting errors, etc. In turn, this may be met by inefficient DNA damage response, disrupted heterochromatin packaging and nuclear and mitochondrial deformations, which eventually compromise the overall function of the cell, leading to cell death.   </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Cancer can also occur as a result of the hypermethylation at the imprinting control regions (ICR) in diploid cells. There, the ICR's are meant to enforce the monoallelic expression of genes of the same cluster in a parent-of-origin manner. For example, inside each H19/Igf2 cluster a group of enhancers interact with both promoters of H19 and Igf2 genes which share a common ICR placed between them. The paternal allele is methylated at the ICR, which spreads the methylation to the nearby H19 gene. Hence, the paternal H19 gene is silent, whereas Igf2 is expressed due to favourable interactions between the enhancers and its promoter. Conversely, the maternal allele is unmethylated at the ICR and the H19 gene locus. In addition, a CTCF insulator is docked in the hypomethylated ICR, thereby shielding only the Igf2 site from enhancer interactions. Hence, the maternal allele expresses H19, whereas the paternal allele expresses Igf2 which contributes to normal cell growth. This imprinting is disrupted in Wilm's tumour, as both ICR's are now hypermethylated, resulting in biallelic H19 silencing and biallelic Igf2 expression. This contributes to upregulated and abnormal cell growth, which eventually leads to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a cytidine analogue, an anti-tumour drug that is used to treat myeloid leukemia. It is a demethylation agent, specifically a DNMT inhibitor. It can also be incorporated into the DNA strand in a manner similar to cystosine nucleoside (cytidine), but it resists de novo methylation by DNMT's. Hence, the drug should target and reverse the local hypermethylation found in cancer. This in turn may reactivate the affected loci to re-promote the expression of genes such as tp53 and others that are needed for tumour suppression and proper DNA damage response. Eventually, this re-expression may induce tumour growth arrest, and eventually destroy the tumour by stopping its proliferation.  </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that epigenetically reprogram tumour cells can have a long-lasting impact because epigenetic alterations are mitotically heritable. That means that they can be passed on down generations until further reprogramming, which occurs during primordial germ-cell development as well as during embryonic development. Hence, there are sensitive periods, such as at 2 weeks prior to conception by sexually active and fertile adults, and at E0.5-8.5 after fertilization. These periods correspond to gametogenesis and embryonic development respectively, whereby it would be unadvisable to administer such treatment, because taking in such hypomethylating agents will likely interfere with the critical periods when the DNA methylation marks are reset and reprogrammed.   </div>
