    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a cell around the H19/Igf2 locus we ordinarily see the methylation of the paternal allele at the
ICR, and no methylation for the maternal allele, the allele from the mother is not methylated in the imprinted control region which leads to the binding of CTCF complex making the lgf2H19 silencing and the H19 active, while the paternal allele has in the impring control region a methyl mark which doesn't make the CTCF complex bind making lgf2H19 expressed and the H19 silencing, Thus, in a regular cell you observe a normal dose of both H19 from maternal strand, and Igf2 from paternal strand. when there is a disruption present the imprinted control region of the mother, it gets methylated which leaves to the expression of lgf2H19, making a double doisis or an overexpression of it, one from paternal allele and one from maternal allele( that is take as a paternal allele), and as lgf2 is a growth promotor the overdose of it and no dose of H19 leave to wilm's tumour.(or is associated with the growth of wilm's tumour).</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell stable CpG islands are hypomethylated so different features are active like the tumor suppressor genes and in the other parts of the cell that are larger parts (genes, intergenomic regions, and repetitive elements) are hypermethylated, these control the genomic stability, controls which parts are deleted, inserted and prevents the transpositions by silencing repeats, when cancer is present or develop this meant that CpG islands past from being hypomethylated, to be hypermethylated leading to the silencing of tumor supressors genes, making the cell overgrowth and over divide, these methylation progress with time, and in the larger parts of the cell when cancer is present or develop for saying so, these parts become from being hypermethylated to be hypomethylated and the genomic stability is threatened and loss of control is seeing, in this parts there is no longer normal karyotype but is seeing delection and insertion where shouldn't and as elements are repeat there is also seeing reciprocal translocations and is also seeing mutations in the cell.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is part of a class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, and hence make a contributiong to
hypomethylation of DNA. This result to be particularly useful in the o<br />treating of myelodysplatic
syndrome (conditions under which the bone marrow produces deformed blood cells), which is a
precursor of acute myelogenous leukemia. In case of Decitabine, the anti­tumour effect has
been linked to reactivation of epigenetically silenced tumor supressor genes, induced by the
hypothemylation. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is a attractive form of regulation in treatments because it
can be manipulated once, and enduring effects are ensured as the DNA methyltransferase
enzymes preserve methyl marks during mitosis and even if this marks are lost DNMT1 recognises hemi-methylated DNA and
restores methylation on both strands,if a change in DNA methylation is given in a sensitive period this could be critical for the development, sensitive period is a time when the environmental changes or stimulus can have a big impact in the development, and it also when an extensive epigenetic reprogramming occurs, the part of the development where the baby is more sensitive to these stimulus will be in months nearly to conception as
a lot of reprogramming happens in early child development as well as during the formation of
gametes (both male and female).</div>
