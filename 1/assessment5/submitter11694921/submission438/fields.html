    <div class="field-value">Although cancer is mostly caused by mutations in the genome itself, epigenetics also play a role. DNA methylation is one of the most characterised epigenetic modifications . It occurs on Cytosine bases by the action of DNA Methytransferase enzymes (dnmt), to form CpG groups or CpG islands. Methylation on CpG islands is most commonly associated with the silencing of genes. Under normal conditions the function of methylation is to silence genes, promoters, or transposable elements which may cause genetic instability and aberant recombinations, whereas genes that are expressed are not methylated. In cancer there are abberant DNA methylation profiles, which are more common than mutations. Intergenic regions, repetitive elements are methylated instead of unmethylated, and there may be genome-wide hypomethylation. This silences tumor suppressor genes. Other consequences are the activation of cryptic promoters, disruption of neighboring genes, and illegitimate recombination. These factors contribute to the progression from hyperplasia to a full blown neoplasm.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Proper gene dosage is required for proper development. This is achieved by the imprinting of genes resulting in parental alleles being expressed at the right time and in the right dosage. The Igf2-H19 tandem gene is activated in the embryo and paternally imprinted. Igf2 promotes the growth of a larger offspring while H19 promotes the growth of a smaller offspring. The expression of these genes is regulated by the epigenetic marks by DNA methylation of CpG rich regions within their loci known as differentially methylated regions(DMR). <br />Under normal conditions the DMR is methylated on the paternal, and erased on the maternal genome.CTCF binds the DMR in the maternal locus preventing transcription of Igf2 and H19 is transcribed, while on the paternal locus CTCF cannot bind and the distal enhancer promotes transcription of Igf2. This ensures a balance in the expression of H19 and Igf2.<br />Loss of imprinting is associated with several kinds of tumors and Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome. Children with BWS usually develop childhood cancers, such as Wilm's tumor(nephroblastoma), due to the over-expression of Igf2, which leads to overproliferation of cells. Although this disorder is mostly due to a deletion, epigenetics contributes to the development of such neoplasms. <br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a drug that has been developed in recent years to help treat cancer. It is classified as a DNA demethylating agent. Some cancers are caused by the silencing of tumor suppressor genes by DNA methylation. Dectitbine depletes DNA methyl transferase 1 (DNMT1), which is the enzyme that adds methyl groups to cytosine bases in DNA. Decitibine is also an anti-metabolite. This means that when it is incorporated into the cell like normal metabolites it has a cytotoxic effect. This can be used to reduce the number of rapidly proliferating cancerous cells. This chemotherapeutic agent has been used to treat  myelodysplastic syndrome.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome. This is because it is a mitotically heritable epigenetic modification. This means as a cell divides by mitosis, its daughter cells will carry the same methylation pattern as the parent. It would be inadvisable to use such drugs during sensitive periods of development. Sensitive periods are periods in which the epigenetic marks on the genome are erased then re-established. In humans and mice there are two periods of this epigenetic reprogramming.These are the period when a pre-implantation embryo is maturing into a blastocyst before it is implanted in the uterus, and during the formation of primordial germ cells. In the former the both the maternal and paternal epigenetic marks are removed then reestablished and imprinted genes and repeats are spared, while in the latter maternal and paternal epigentic marks, and imprinted genes are removed then reestablished and only repeats are silenced. If treatment was given during a sensitive period this could result in aberrant DNA methylation patterns, which would lead to developmental abnormalities and malignancies<br /><span class="_wysihtml5-temp"></span></div>
