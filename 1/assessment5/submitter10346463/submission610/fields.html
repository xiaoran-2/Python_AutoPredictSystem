    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>CpG islands (usually found at the promoters of genes) are normally unmethylated or hypomethylated. <b>Unmethylated </b>or <b>hypomethylated CpG islands</b> cause <b>normal expression of the corresponding genes</b>.</li><li>In normal cells, the CpG islands tend to be hypomethylated, whereas <b>in cancer cells</b>, the <b>CpG islands are</b>, usually, <b>hypermethylated</b>.</li><li>As CpG islands are mostly found at the promoters of <b>tumor suppressor genes</b>, the <b>hypermethylation of such CpG islands in cancer</b> causes these <b>genes to be repressed</b> (i.e. <b>silencing of these genes</b>), resulting in <b>uncontrolled cell division</b>, thus promoting growth of tumor cells and immortality.<br /></li><li>Normally, DNA at the <b>intergenic regions and repetitive elements tends to be hypermethylated</b>, resulting in silencing their expression, so as to <b>prevent g</b><b>enetic mutations</b>.</li><li>In cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements <b>become hypomethylated</b>, thus resulting in <b>genetic mutations</b>.</li><li><strong>DNA hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements</strong> causes genetic mutations through <strong>insertions, deletions and reciprocal translocations due to illegitimate recombinations</strong>, resulting in <strong>genomic unstability</strong>, causing abnormal karyotype in the patient. Such hypomethylation may also activate repetitive elements, causing them to <strong>disrupt coding region</strong> of a normally active gene or <strong>activation of neighbouring genes</strong>, which may normally be silenced. All the above result in establishment and progression of cancer through tumorigenesis.<br /></li></ul><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>In normal cells, in the H19/Igf2 cluster, the <b>paternal allele</b> has a <b>methylated imprint control region</b><b> </b>(ICR), thus <b>promoting the expression</b> of the oncogene <b>Igf2</b>, which is upstream of the ICR, since the enhancers in the cluster are free to act on the Igf2 gene.</li><li>The above cluster, in <b>maternal allele</b>, has an <b>unmethylated ICR</b>, causing <b>expression of the Igf2 gene</b>, as the enhancers do not access Igf2, but instead cause activation of the H19 gene.</li><li>Due to loss of imprinting in Wilm's tumor, both the <b>maternal, as well as paternal, ICRs</b> become <b>hypermethylated</b>, resulting in <b>over-expression</b> of the growth promoting oncogene <b>Igf2</b>.</li><li>The over-expression of Igf2 results in cancerdue to the double dose of the expression of the tumorigenic oncogene Igf2.<br /></li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li><b>Decitabine</b> is a nucleoside analogue and, consequently, a <b>DNA methyltransferase</b> (DNMT)<b> inhibitor</b>. Thus, it is a <b>DNA-demethylating</b> agent.</li><li>The function of DNMT is to bind a replicating DNA and copy its methylation onto the nelwy synthesised daughter strand too. As Decitabine is a <b>nucleoside analogue</b>, it gets incorporated into the DNA. During replication, Decitabine causes the DNMT to bind <b>irreversibly</b> to such DNA, thus preventing DNA mehylation of the daughter strand, resulting in DNA-demethylation.</li><li>Thus, Decitabine causes <strong>demethylation of the hypermethylated regions in cancer cells</strong>, as they are constantly dividing and their DNA is replicating. Conversely, they cause <strong>less harm to the normal cells of the body</strong>, which do not divide as much.<br /></li></ul><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have a lasting effect on the epigenome, since <strong>epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable</strong> and passed onto daughter cells, till they are erased.</li><li><strong>Sensitive period</strong> is the period during which the cells of the body undergo <strong>epigenetic reprogramming</strong><strong>, </strong>i.e. erasure and re-establishment of epigenetic marks.</li><li>During development, the sensitive periods have been identified to be during <strong>early embryonic development</strong> and <strong>primordial germ cell development</strong>.</li><li>Treating patients during the sensitive periods of development is inadvisable, as <strong>epigenetic changes caused by the epigenome-targeting drugs </strong>may cause these <strong>changes to last in the cells of the body for the lifetime of humans</strong>.<br /></li></ul></div>
