    <div class="field-value">Methylation at CpG islands inactivates or silences a gene. Most CpG islands are usually not methylated in normal cells. This is disrupted in cancer where it is found that tumor specific CpG islands are hypermethylated. This hypermethylation disruption of CpG islands contributes to cancer because CpG islands are usually found in the promoters of cancer suppressor genes. When these promoters are inactivated by hypermethylation, tumor suppressor genes are silenced and transcription of their associated proteins cannot take place.Cancerous cell divisions are not stopped. The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to stablilize the genome. These regions are methylated in normal cells but are hypomethylated in cancer cells. These areas lose methylation in cancer. This hypomethylation of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements can lead to abnormalities in chromosome karyotypes that include deletions, insertions, translocations and sometimes duplications of entire chromosomes. Tumor suppressor genes might end up being deleted. Oncogenes might end up being duplicated in error leading to increased, limitless cancerous cell divisions. If repetitive elements are demethylated they become active and can make copies of themselves and jump to other parts of chromosomes where they can be inserted into a gene thus disabling it.  It this happened to a tumor suppressor gene, it would become inactivated and cancerous cell divisions could occur. The hypomethylation opens up the chromatin so that these repetitive elements can become activated, unlike when they were methylated and packaged into heterochromatin.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the H19/Igf2 cluster in normal cells, the paternal allele is methylated at the imprint control center (ICR). This prevents binding of the paternal ICR by the insulator protein called CTCF. Because the paternal ICR is not insulated, the Igf2 gene is accessible to enhancers downstream that can boost the activation of Igf2 expression.  In contrast, the maternal allele is unmethylated at the ICR. Without methylation, the maternal ICR becomes bound by the insulator CTCF. This blocks the enhancers from activating the Igf2 gene. Instead, it is silenced while a different gene, H19 get the enhanced gene expression. Imprinting is disrupted in the case of Wilm's tumor, a childhood kidney disease, because the maternal imprint control center is methylated, unlike in a normal cell.  Because the maternal ICR is methylated, it cannot be bound by the insulator CTCF. This allows the Igf2 gene to be activated by the enhancers. These cells no longer have imprinting since both the maternal and paternal chromosome have gene expression of Igf2.  Igf2 is an oncogene which means it promotes cell growth and division. These cells now have two activated Igf2 genes rather than one. This oncogene expression is found in Wilm's tumor cancerous cells.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA-demethylating epigenetic drugs. It is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. So Decitabine targets the enzyme that would lay down methyl groups and is approved for use in patients who suffer from myelodysplastic syndrome which leads to myeloid leukemia, a blood cancer. Decitabine would prevent the DNA methyltransferase from laying down methyl groups onto daughter DNA strands when the cell divides. It does so because Decitabine is a nucleoside analog and gets incorporated into the newly synthesized DNA. At these nucleoside postitions the DNA methyltransferase gets bound irreversibly and cannot be released  so the daughter strands cannot be methylated.  Particular hypermethylated CpG islands have been associated with a poor prognosis for these cancer victims, Perhaps their demethylation as well as that elsewhere with the low dose use of.Decitabine is a possible reason for the favorable results seen and killing of these tumor cells with this drug.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment because the changes in methylation have occurred on the DNA of dividing cells. Daughter strands of the DNA will pass on the changes to the new daughter cells and beyond. So, perhaps tumor suppressor genes are now demethylated and can be active again, for instance. These epigenetic changes will be maintained until they might be actively erased. Sensitive periods would be times when the DNA epigenetic marks are erased and reprogrammed. These sensitive periods during development would include early pre-implantation and early post-implantation of the ferilized egg and formation of primordial germ cells in the devloping embryo and formation of mature gametes. There are other tissue specific sensitive periods too. Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because it could interfere with laying down epigenetic marks such as methyl or acetyl groups that are necessary for life. So, treating a pregnant woman whose embryo is developing could have disastrous effects on the embryo, the placenta, or the germ cells. Treating a child could have deleterious effects on their germ cells or other organs that are maturing. <br /></div>
