    <div class="field-value"><i>CpG Islands in normal cells are generally not methylated. Of course this depends on the type of cell at hand nevertheless in most cells the majority of the CpG island are not methylated, which enables normal expression of genes in cells. In cancer CpG island tend to be methylated. As cancer progresses more hypermethylation can be found at CpG islands. Often hypermethylated CpG islands in Cancer are related to silencing of tumour suppressing genes. Bearing in mind that epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable this hypermethylation is passed to daughter cells, which ultimately leads to a colonization of the tissue by cancer cells with hypermethylation of CpG islands. In normal cells intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated to maintain genomic stability. Exactly the opposite can be said about cancer cells as hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements can be found. As mentioned earlier hypomethylation of this regions contributes to genomic instability e.g. deletions, translocations and insertions. </i><i>Translocations are caused by recombination of repetitive elements, which normally are hypermethylated and then they wont align, but when hypomethyletion of this regions occurs then repetitive regions align and recombine between chromosomes, which leads to genomic instability. Insertions of repetitive elements is caused by replication of repetitive elements, which later can be moved to a different place in the genome causing e.g. mistakes in transcription of a gene by inserting this transpozome in an exon . Hypomethylation of repetitive elements might also cause over-expression of genes as strong promoters are neighbouring this elements. This over-expressed genes can be growth promoters causing cancer.</i><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In general in cancer cells there is loss of imprinted genes caused by hypermethylation or hypomethylation of imprint control regions. One of the examples is H19/Igf2 cluster. In normal cells the imprint control region at the paternal allele is methylated, which leads to an interaction between the enhancer and Igf2 causing expression of Igf2. At the maternal allele the imprint control region is unmethylated causing CTCF an insulator element to link to the imprint control region, which enables the enhancers to interact with H19 therefore expressing it. In a cancer cell (Wilms tumour) both alleles are methylated over-expressing Igf2, which is a growth promoter. In this case over-expression of a growth promoter leads to cancer (uncontrolled growth and division of cells). <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. Decitabine is incorporated into DNA when replications occurs and when DNMT1 comes to lay a methylation mark, DNMT1 becomes irreversibly linked to the DNA not being able to function any more, therefore decreasing the methylation. This drug only works on cells that replicate so in theory it should work better on cancer cells as they divide more than normal cells. Decitabine is not cancer specific so it has an effect on normal cells too. In general Decitabine causes demethylation in cancer cells. It is mostly used in myelodysplastic syndrome. It is thought that it works so well on myelodysplastic syndrome because there is a lot of CpG methylation and as this drug decreases DNA methylation it works extremely well in this patients with myelodysplastic syndrome. Decitabine can be used to treat cancer with aid from chemotherapy.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Most of the drugs that target epigenetic machinery so far are not cancer cell specific so they affect normal cells as well. Considering this it is not yet particularly clear what are the long term consequences of taking this drugs. Nevertheless the drugs used seems to have very good results. It is clear that drugs altering epigenetic machinery should not be taken during sensitive periods. One can define a sensitive period in epigenetics as a period in the individuals life when part of epigenetic marks are removed and then again laid down, which means that during this time the epigenetics of a cell change to a certain degree. Embryogenesis, germ cells development and early life are considered sensitive periods. Giving drugs to people during this sensitive period could cause damage to the epigenome developing other diseases in the upcoming generations a well as in our generation. All this considered maybe using a mix of epigenetic drugs and standard chemotherapy might have a positive therapeutic outcome. This can be caused by alteration of the epigenome in such a way that cancer cells are more susceptible to chemotherapy. It can also be caused by stoping the proliferation of cancer with hypomethylation.<br /></div>
