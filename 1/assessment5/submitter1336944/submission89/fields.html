    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value">In normal tissues, DNA methylation at CpG islands is minimal, this is, CpG islands are hypomethylated. With tumour progression, CpG islands become hypermethylated. Since these CpG islands can be found at promoter regions of tumour suppressor genes, when they are hypermethylated, transcription factors cannot bind to promoter regions and the tumour suppressor genes are silenced, thus favouring tumour progression to more advanced stages of cancer. These DNA methylation changes are stable epigenetic marks and mitotically heritable, so if a cancer cell is  affected, it will pass this epimutation to the daughter cells. Also, DNA hypermethylation at CpG islands can silence several important tumour suppressor genes, hiting the cells by several mechanisms of  neoplastic transformation, according to the Knudson hypothesis. <br />In intergenic regions and repetitive elements, DNA  is normally in a hypermethylated state, making these inactive regions. With tumour progression, DNA at intergenic regions and repetive elements becomes gradually hypomethylated. This hypomethylation causes genomic instability and further disruptions occur with gene alterations by illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition or activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes like the Axin fused or Agouti viable yellow alleles. This state of chromosomal instability can drive tumourigenesis, increasing the chances of mutation.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div> Paternal methylation at the imprinting control region prevents the binding of the insulator protein CTCF binding and together with methylation at the H19 promoter, which causes H19 silencing, allows the enhancers to access Igf2, increasing its expression. On the maternal allele the imprinting control region remains unmethylated allowing CTCF  and its cofactors (cohesins and p68/SRA) to bind and insulate Igf2 from downstream enhancers. This interaction mediates enhancer blocking allowing downstream enhancers to access the H19 promoter.<br />When there is loss of imprinting at the maternal allele, it behaves like the paternal allele, causing a double dose of Igf2. This occurs by several possible mechanisms: Mutation/ deletion to cause loss of imprinting; Uniparental disomy with two copies of one parental chromosome, here paternal UPD; Rare epigenetic disruption for loss of imprinting. The loss of imprinting and consequential increase of Igf2, coupled with loss of Cdkn1c is characteristic of Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome, which included a predisposition to embryonic tumours such as Wilm's tumour, as loss of Cdkn1c allows for unlimited replication and excess of Igf2 promotes abnormal tissue growth, two features of cancer cells.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, or a DNA demethylating agent, as the name implies, it removes methyl groups from methylated citosines and inserts nucleoside analogues, binding irreversibly to the DNA. Decitabine is used in cases of myelodisplasic syndromes which precede <span>acute myelogenous leukaemia. In myelodisplasic syndromes there is a dependency on the silencing of tumour suppressor genes by hypermethylation of promoters, so by  using demethylating agents it is possible to restore normal expression of tumour suppressor genes. Although this affects all cells in the body, myelodisplasic syndromes seem to be very susceptible to the use of demethylating agents which are well tolerated by the patients.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic mark, mitotically heritable, thus when it is altered by demethylating agents, for example, these have irreversible effects and can be maintained by the cells resulting from division of the originally treated cells.<br />There are periods of development that are called sensitive because that is when epigenetic reprogramming occurs, with removal of parental and maternal epigenetic marks and lay down of new ones. The most sensitive periods are during primordial germ cell development (children) and pre-implantation (during pregnancy). During these periods, treating young patients or pregnant women with drugs that alter DNA methylation or other epigenetic marks would not be recommended because it would interfere and cause abnormal methylation patterns to be established. These abnormal patterns of methylation would have consequences for all the adult life of the individual.</div>
