    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are found in 60% of gene
promoters and are usually unmethylated independent of their activity
state. In cancer, CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated causing the
silencing of the undelying gene. Tumor-supressing genes can be
silenced this way promoting cancer.</p>
<p>In normal cells, intragenic regions and
repetitive elements are methylated. However, in cancer there is a
genome-wide loss of DNA-methylation including these elements,
allowing for genomic instability (i.e. by transposition of the
repetitive elements causing gene mutations) that contributes to
cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>
	
	
	


</p><p>Altering DNA methylation causes
epigenetic changes and thus passed on to the daughter cells during
cell-division. A sensitive period is when epigenetic changes occur
such as germ cell development. Because of this, treating young
patients who are still developing germ cells would be inadvisable, as
the epigenetic changes would be passed on the these germ cells as
well.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>
At
the paternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster, the imprint control
region (ICR) is methylated, blocking the binding of CTCF. Because of
this, the methylation spreads to the H19 promoter which is then
silenced and concurently the enhancers can access Igf2 to induce gene
expression. In contrast in the maternal allele the ICR is
unmethlyated, CTCF can bind and insulate Igf2 from downstream
enhancers, and so they act on the H19 gene which then will be
expressed.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, because of
hypomethylation the imprinting is lost and so Igf2 is expressed from
both alleles causing a double dose of Igf2. Because this gene is
growth promoting, the double dose contributes to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an epigenetic drug
causing reduced DNA methylation. By incorporating into the dividing
DNA, it binds DNA methyltransferase irreversibely, inhibiting the
effect of the enzyme and thus causing DNA-demethylation. It acts on
dividing cells so cancer cells are affected more severely than normal
cells. It may slow down tumor growth if dispensed in a small dose.
Alternatively if it employed before standard chemotherapeutic
treatment, the standard treatment may provide better results, because
the epigenome has been altered previously by employing decitabine.</p></div>
