    <div class="field-value">Normally a cell has methylated CpG islands in gene introns, intergenic regions, and repetitive element regions, This methylation reduces transcriptional noise from alternative start sites, anti-sense transcription, and transcription of satellite repeats and remnants of retroviral insertions. These methylated islands can also lead to the formation of heterochromatin which further blocks access to DNA, preventing unwanted transcription and stabilizing the genome. CpG islands in other regions such as gene promoters are usually unmethylated, allowing euchromatin formation and normal gene transcription.  <br /><br />With cancer this methylation pattern is reversed. As cancer develops there is progressive hypomethylation across the whole genome and regional hypermethylation of some gene promoter regions. <br /><br />The hypermethylation of the promoter region of tumor suppressor genes inhibits transcription, thereby promoting cancer. I.e., genes that normally protect against cancer are silenced.<br /><br />In cancer, genome wide hypomethylation of DNA can lead to undesired transcription in gene introns and intergenic regions which can interfere with normal DNA transcription and splicing. Hypomethylation of repeats can lead to mis-match recombination errors causing insertion, deletion, or translocation mutations. Hypomethylation can lead to activation of repetitive elements causing disruptive transpositions or activation of strong cryptic promoters causing abnormal gene transcription which interferes with normal gene transcription. In general hypomethylation causes genome instability.<br /><br />Hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters can also lead to excessive transcription of oncogenes, promoting cancer.<br /><br />Mutations that disrupt DNMTs can cause hypomethylation that promote cancers.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is inherited during mitotic cell division so epigenetic methylation patterns are inherited by a cancer's daughter cells. Alterations to the epigenetic state can last a lifetime and some might even affect later generations of offspring.<br /><br />Sensitive periods are times when important reprogramming of cell epigenetics occurs, specifically silencing of IAP's and gene imprinting. There are two main sensitive periods. The first is from fertilization through implantation of the blastocyst and affects all fetal tissue, potentially harming a patient's child. During this period imprinting and IAP silencing marks need to be maintained. The second occurs during midgestation when parental imprinted epigenetics are reset for each gender in primordial germ cell line development. Problems with imprinted genes could harm the patient's grandchildren.<br /><br />Treating patients during sensitive periods could lead to problems in their children or grandchildren caused by non-silenced repetitive elements or inappropriate silencing of imprinted genes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Igf2 is a growth stimulating signal protein. In normal cells the ICR of the paternal allele of the H!(/Igf2 cluster is methylated, preventing binding with CTCF and allowing enhancers to interact with the Igf2 gene promoter causing transcription and promoting growth. The ICR of the maternal allele is unmethylated, allowing CTCF to bind and block enhancer access to the Igf2 promoter, stopping Igf2 transcription and inhibiting growth. Activation of the paternal Igf2 allele and inhibition of the maternal Igf2 allele provides the balanced level of Igf2 signaling needed for normal development.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumour hypermethylation also methylates the maternal ICRs so that CTCF can't bind. The enhancers then cause both maternal and paternal copies of the Igf2 allele to be transcribed, producing too much Igf2 and causing excessive growth. When both paternal Igf2 alleles are active there is too much Igf2 signaling and cancer growth is accelerated.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is in the class of DNMTi's (DNA methyl transferase inhibitors). DNMT's are enzymes that maintain DNA methylation state as cells divide, providing mitotic epigenetic inheritance from a cell to its daughters, or establish new methylation patterns as cells differentiate.<br /><br />Decitabine inhibits enzymes which restore the methylation marks to DNA during cell division. This results in loss of methylation in successive generations of daughter cells.<br /><br />All the mechanisms by which Decitabine inhibits cancer  are not known. However hypermethylation of CpG islands in some promoter regions is a predictor of bad cancer outcomes. Methylation in the promoters of tumor repressor genes inhibits their transcription, promoting cancer. In a growing cancer, as cancer cells expand through cell division, Decitabine could reduce methylation in the promoters of tumor repressor genes and restore their transcription, restoring anti-tumor activity in the daughter cells.</div>
