    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation consists on the addition of a methyl group to the DNA and has the effect of regulating (typically suppressing) the expression of neighbouring genes. In normal cells, DNA methylation is required for genomic imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation and suppression of repetitive elements (such as satellites or transposons). In its normal function, DNA methylation occurs primarily in intragenic regions and in CpG islands of silenced genes. CpG islands are regions of high density of dinucleotide CpG that can be 
identified in 60% of gene promoters. When the CpG island is methylated, 
gene expression is silenced. In cancer cells, the methylation pattern is
 reversed: there is an overall loss of genome-wide methylation 
(hypomethylation) and a hypermethylation of CpG islands of specific 
genes whose suppression is beneficial for cancer, e.g., tumor 
suppressors. The first example was detected in colorectal cancer in 
1999, where hypermethylation of CpG islands was shown to lead to the 
transcriptional inactivation of tumour suppressors p16 and THBS1 (Toyota
 et al, PNAS, 1999). <br /><br /><br />In intragenic regions of normal cells, methylation is found at repetitive elements (RE) whose expression would compromise genomic stability. REs are repetitive patterns of DNA sequences and are heavily methylated in healthy cells. Loss of methylation in REs has been associated with loss of chromosome structure and genome
 integrity, possibly due to the erroneous pairing of repetitive sequences during DNA replication leading to chromosome rearrangements. In cancer cells, global loss of methylation implies specific loss of methylation at REs, increasing genomic instability. In addition, genetic mutations can also target the epigenetic machinery leading to reduced DNA methylation, e.g,  mutations of the DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) has been reported in colorectal cancer (Kanai et al, Cancer Lett, 2003). <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Genomic imprinting regions are regions of monoallelic expression based on parent of origin selective gene expression. Imprinted genes typically exit in clusters, e.g., the H19/Igf2 cluster, and unlike X inactivation, expression of imprinted genes  is tissue specific. The mechanism of imprinting control changes from cluster to cluster, so I will focus only on the H19/Igf2 cluster. <br /><br /><div>Igf2 and H19 are two genes closely located in chromosome 11. In normal cells, the imprinting control region (ICR) that controls the expression of the cluster is methylated in the paternal allele, and unmethylated in the maternal allele. Lack of methylation (in the maternal allele) enables the binding of CTCF, an insulator protein, that insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. Conversely, on the paternal allele, DNA methylation at ICR blocks binding of CTCF. DNA methylation can therefore spread to the H19 promoter and downstream enhancers, which become active and can promote expression of Igf2. <br /><br />In Wilms tumors, the maternal chromosome reverses to a paternal 
epigenotype. In this case, both alleles have a paternal pattern of methylation of the H19 promoter, leading to growth promoting IGF2 being turned on, and H19 turned off, causing increased cell growth. Hypermethylation of the ICR in cancer can result in a similar phenotype.<br /></div><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, that is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, 
the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. Decitabine is a chemical analogue of cytidine, a nucleoside present in DNA and RNA. Cells in the presence of Decitabine incorporate it into DNA during replication (thus fast replicating cancer cells are particularly sensitive) and into RNA during transcription. Decitabine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects by being incorporated into replicating DNA and inhibiting the activity of DNA methyltransferases, the enzyme 
that is responsible for methylating of newly synthesized DNA in mammalian 
cells. This results in hypomethylation of DNA and cellular 
differentiation or apoptosis. Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in 
neoplastic cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical 
for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that act on the epigenetic machinery might induced epigenetic changes that are mitotically inheritable, e.g., lower levels of global methylation achieved through inhibition of methyltransferases would be inhereted by daughter cells. This is an attractive therapeutic option as the patient can continue to receive the benefits of the drug even after the treatment is over. However caution should be used before medicating young patients or patients during procreative age, since these inheritable changes might produce unwanted long-term side effects or affect the epigenetic programming of the gametes and thus be transmitted to the next generation. For similar reasons, these drugs should be avoided in pregnant women (or in the few months before conception) as extensive epigenetic programming happens during the early child development. <br /></div>
