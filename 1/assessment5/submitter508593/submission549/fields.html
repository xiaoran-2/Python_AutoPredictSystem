    <h1>Submission 549 from Anon (session_user_id: 42af8754890ff091768f79b47c9728d1859dd1bf)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that
alters DNA methylation pattern can have enduring effects on the epigenome by
ensuring demethylation memory in the specific sites of the whole genome (when
no more drug needed) or by continuing drugs if restoring of hypomethylation/demethylation marks is
not possible for parents cell to daughter cell during the process of
mitosis.  Sensitive period means early
life when increased sensitivity to the
regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms has been noted. So I think there is
no need of avoiding epigenetics drugs in adult human during any developmental
process. But if needed its must be during the sperm and eggs cell development those are actually producing gamete. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine belongs to  “DNA demethylating” agents. It inhibits DNA
methylation and causes hypo methylation which is being used to treat </span>myelodysplastic
syndromes, which is a precursor of   <span>acute myelogenous
leukaemia. DNA methylation inhibits the activity of tumor suppressor genes as a
results tumor cell grows up due to aberrant cell division. Here Decitabine
reduces the DNA methylation (restoring the activity of tumor suppressing genes)
and can keeps expressing tumor-suppressing genes which can helps in regulate
normal cell development.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>In normal cell imprint control region is
methylated in paternal allele and unmethylated in maternal allele. In the
maternal allele CTCF binds (insulator elements) the unmethylated imprint
control regions. As a result enhancers will act on H19 rather than IGF2. As a
result IFG2 will be silent from being expressed. In the paternal allele enhancer
will direct work on IGF2 as there is not insulator on methylated imprint
control region as a result IGF2 will be expressed.  In wilm’s tumor both maternal and paternal
imprint control region is methylated and there is no CTCF binders. As a result
enhancers can easily works on IGF2 to make it expressed, and more methylation
matter will be appeared in both allele and H19 will be silenced in compared to
normal cell. As IGF2 is a growth promoter its helps in developing tumor in the
kidney among children. </span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Normal function of DNA methylation at CpG Island is to express
or silence the expression of certain genes and maintain genetic stability.
Altered DNA methylation of CpG islands promotes aberrant cell division
(Neoplasm) by silencing tumor-suppressing genes and activating oncogenes
contribute in cancer. Normally we can see intergenic regions and repetitive
elements are hyper methylated in contrast to CpG islands. Demethylation or
hypomethylation in the presence of enzyme leads to insertion, deletion or reciprocal
translocation at intergenic regions and repetitive element which triggers genomic
instability and contributes to cancer development.   </span></p></div>
