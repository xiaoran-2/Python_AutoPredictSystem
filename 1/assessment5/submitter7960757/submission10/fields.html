    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normally, DNA is unmethylated at CpG islands. However, DNA at CpG islands is more likely to be methylated in cancer cells, especially in tumor suppressor genes. By methylating the CpG island in tumor suppressor genes, cancer cells are able to silence the genes more effectively than genetic mutation, given that DNA methylation is mitotically heritable.<br /><br />On the other hand, DNA is generally hypomethylated in intergenic regions and repetitive elements in cancer cells when compared with normal cells. This relative lack of methylation may result in illegitimate recombinations between repeats: swapping of part of chromosomes. In addition, these repeats can transpose onto different parts on the genome, thus disrupting other genes and generally creating genomic instability.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The imprint control region is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele. On the maternal allele, CTCF acts to protect Igf2 from downstream enhancers by binding to the unmethylated ICR, thus making the enhancers act on H19. On the paternal allele, CTCF cannot bind to the methylated ICR, so Igf2 expression is enhanced. The methylation spreads downstream to the H19 gene, thus silencing the gene.Thus, Igf2 is only produced from the paternal allele and H19 is only produced from the maternal allele in a normal cell.<br /><br />In Beckwith Wiedemann Syndrome, the patient has two copies of the paternal allele and no copy of the maternal allele. This leads to overproduction of Igf2, a growth enhancer, and lack of production of Cdkn1c, a growth suppressor. This can result in Wilm's tumor, a tumor found in the kidney.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, which means that it hypomethylates DNA. Decitabine is useful in treating myelodysplastic syndromes, a precursor to acute myelogenous leukaemia. <span>Decitabine can have an anti-tumor effect by erasing the tumor-specific epigenetic marks on tumor cells. When the marks are erased, they do not return in future generations of the cell, thus eradicating the tumor without killing the cell.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is preserved in mitosis, so creating a change in methylation epigenetically only needs to be done once to have a lasting effect. A sensitive period is a time of development when epigenetic reprogramming is extremely common. Sensitive periods of development occur mid-gestation, so it would be inadvisable to treat pregnant patients due to the plethora of reprogramming that would be occurring at this time.</div>
