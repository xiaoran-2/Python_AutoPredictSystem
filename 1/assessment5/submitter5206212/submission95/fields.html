    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is an important heritable epigenetic mark involved in numerous biological processes including regulation of gene expression, imprinting, X chromosome inactivation and silencing of retrotransposons. In mammals, DNA methylation mostly occurs in cytosines followed by guanines, the so called CpG sites. Mammalian genomes are overall depleted of CpG. However there are certain genomic regions with a density of CpG sites higher than expected by chance, traditionally named CpG islands (CGI).  Many CGI are located on gene promoters, and CGI hypermethylation provokes gene repression. Given its crucial regulatory function, disruption of normal methylation patterns can lead to disease. Cancer is characterized by an overall genome-wide reduction of methylation levels while CGI  hypermethylation at certain gene promoters. Hypermethylation of CGI in cancer normally occurs at the promoter of tumour suppresor genes, genes whose normal function is to prevent the cell for uncontrolled growth and division. By hypermethylating the CGI at the promoter of these genes, their expression is being prevented and thus the cell proliferates without control. In normal cells, intergenic and repetitive elements are normally methylated. This contributes on the one hand to maintain the genome integrity and stability and on the other hand it also prevents the mobilization of mobile elements such as retrotransposons. In cancer cells however, there's an overall reduction of methylation levels genome-wide. This causes genome instability and facilites aberrant genomic rearrangements such as whole or partial chromosome duplications, deletions, fusions or even recombination between non-homologous genomic regions that nonetheless present certain similarity for example they are flanked by repetitive elements. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Loss of imprinting is a common feature of cancer cells. Many imprinted genes are related to cell growth and they either promote or prevent  it,  and are normally expressed either only from the maternally or paternally inherited allele. Disruption of imprinting can cause that neither or both alleles are expressed. The H19/Igf2 cluster holds the following configuration: in the maternally inherited allele the ICR is unmethylated and as a consequence CTCF can bind this insulator element what results on enhancers acting on HG19; in the paternally inherited allele the ICR is methylated and CTCF cannot bind and thus the enhancers act on Igf2 which is expressed. The final result is maternal expression of HG19 and paternal expression of Igf2.  In Wilm's tumour the ICR is methylated in both the maternal and paternal allele. As a consequence, there is double the dose of Igf2 in cancer cells compared to normal cells , being Igf2 a growth promoter.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Alterations in the machinery involved in either establishing or reading epigenetic marks can also contribute to the development of cancer. For example, mutations in DNA metyltransferases (DNMTs) can alter methylation patterns since mutated version of these enzymes could methylate the promoter, as thus prevent the expression, of genes that should be express such as tumour suppresor genes. Decitabin belongs to the DNA demethylation class of agents: it hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferases. Overall, the usage of Decibatine reduces cell methylation levels (inhibits methylation) and in that sense it effects an anti-tumout effect.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic alterations introduced in a cell by a drug are passed on during cell division to the daughter cells, and thus even after withdrawal of the treatment cells would still carry the modifications induced by the drug. Sensitive periods are time periods where characteristic epigenetic patterns are being established and are essential for determining cell identity and normal function. Embryonic development would be one such sensitive period. Treating patients during sensitive periods (for instance in a pregnant woman) would be inadvisable because it could disrupt the normal establishment of epigenetic marks in the fetus and the establishment on long-lasting abnormal epigenetic marks that could compromise the development of the embryo.</div>
