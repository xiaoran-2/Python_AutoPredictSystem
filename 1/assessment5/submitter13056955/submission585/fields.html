    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are responsible to be the promoter regions in a gene thus its methylation would silence the activity of the gene which is not the case in non-CpG island promoter regions. <br />Disruptions of methylation at CpG islands leads to silencing of tumour suppressor genes (such as RB in retinoblastoma).<br />DNA is generally hypermethylated at the intergenic regions and at the repititive elements but in case of cancer, there is hypomethylation in these regions. As these regions play role in avoiding the background noise during transcriptions and providing alternate start sites and thereby maintaining the genome stabiloty.<br />Hypomethylation at these intergenic and repititive element sites leads to multiple start sites and antisense rNA transcription which ultimately leads to genomic instability.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is DNA Methyltransferase Inhibiting agent which hypomethylates the DNA by inhibiting the activity of DNA methyltransferase.<br />The anti-­tumour effect of decitabine is associated with reactivation of epigenetically silenced tumor supressor genes which is induced by the hypothemylation.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation forms the basis of the epigenetic identity of a genome in a cell, manipulation of such a vital factor leads to various effects on the DNA methyltransferase which is responsible for maintaining the DNA methylation patterns even in the coming generations. Thus interference with this program can lead to disruption of the normal functioning and development of the cells.<br />The periods of pre-implantation development; the primordial germline development and gametogenesis are termed as the sensitive periods as there is constant flux in methylation patterns in the developing embryo and the gametes which leads to active reprogramming of the developing cells.<br />Therefore treating patients during their sensitive periods could have adverse effects on the developmental mechanisms for the normal functioning of the system.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In case of imprinting and cancer with respect to H19-Igf2 cluster, on the paternal allele, the ICR (imprint control region) is hypermethylated which avoids the binding of CTCF (insulator) to it thus causing the Enhancers to lead the expression of IGF2 thereby stimulating growth.<br />On the Maternal allele, the ICR (imprint control region) is unmethylated which allows the binding of CTCF and thus downregualting the Enhancers and thus silencing the maternal IGF2 expression.<br />However in case of Wilm's Tumour, ICR(imprint control region) of both parental alleles are hypermethylated avoiding the binding of CTCF at these regions causing a two-fold increase in the Enhancer activity and leading to a two-fold increased IGF2 expression.<br />Tbe disruption at the H19/IGF2 cluster leads to overgrowth of these cells as compared to normal cells which is due to silencing of the growth restriction genes and over-expression of growth promoting genes which is in case of hypermethylation of both parental ICRs.</div>
