    <h1>Submission 303 from Anon (session_user_id: 2c90eaaec3e2114d694f7f4c983030dff87cfd6c)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Epigenetic changes can have enduring effects on the </span><span>epigenome, as many of them (e.g. DNA methylation) are passed on to daughter cells during cell division. Therefore, epigenetic changes caused by a drug or chemotherapy will be passed on after the period of drug treatment. <br />Epigenetic drugs may affect the epigenetic landscape or both healthy and unhealthy cells, so there are many potential side effects. Epigenetic drugs have been tested on cancer patients, where long term side-effects are not well examined, as patient survival is the primary concern. In particular, there are some sensitive periods where the organism has increased sensitivity to epigenetic machinery, especially in early stages of development. <br />Therefore, giving epigenetic drugs to young patients may be inadvisable, as the development of their germ cells may be severely affected. <br /><br /></span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine  is a DNA-demethylating agent, which is used to treat MDS (myelodysplastic syndromes) and AML (acute myeloid leukemia). <br />Decitabine is a chemical analog of cytidine (cytosine attached to a ribose/deoxyribose ring, a component of RNA and DNA). It can be incorporated in DNA chains where it inhibits DNA methyltransferase. Overall, decitabine will<span> decrease the amount of cellular DNA methylation.</span><br />Many cancers present excessive methylation of tumor suppressor genes, inhibiting their expression. Inhibition of tumor suppressor genes can allow tumor cells to divide indefinitely without being suppressed, disable DNA repair mechanisms and avoid apoptosis. Therefore, a DNA-demethylating agent can restore the expression of tumor suppressor genes, which may cause cancer cells to undergo apoptosis or at least stop dividing.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">CpG island are CpG dense regions found at gene promoters. They are typically hypermethylated in normal cells (70-80%) and are associated to gene silencing. Promoters of expressed genes are hypomethylated. Methylation of CpG shore regions (~2kb regions surrounding CpG islands) are also involved in regulating gene expression.  <br />In cancer, CpG islands often become hypermethylated. In particular, CpG islands at tumor suppressor genes get methylated, thus inhibiting the expression of tumor suppressor genes. CpG island shores are also hypermethylated in some cancers.<br />The inhibition of tumor suppression genes contributes to cancer, by allowing the cancer to grow uncontrollably while escaping apoptosis and the DNA-repair mechanism.<br /><br />Outside CpG regions, methylation occurs to silence highly repetitive regions such as satellites and retrotransposons. Furthermore, g<span>ene body methylation is found in highly expressed genes and may be involved in alternative splicing and repressing alternative start sites.<br />In cancer, the overall level of methylation is reduced. This hypomethylation causes </span><span>deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes (many of which related to growth). Reducing the methylation of repetitive regions may also activate silent promoters, which can in turn cause the over-expression of oncogenes.<br />The increased expression of these </span>oncogenes contributes to cancer by changing cell growth and differentiation pathways, causing <span>uncontrolled cell proliferation.</span><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19 contains an imprinted region which is differentially methylated with respect to parental inheritance. The paternal copy of H19 is usually methylated, while the maternal copy is hypo- or unmethylated. When the ICR is methylated, downstream enhancers will cause expression of Ifg2, whereas when the ICR is not methylated, CTCF will bind to the region, isolate Igf2 and H19 and the downstream enhancers will cause expression of H19. Therefore, methylation of CpGs is negatively correlated with H19 expression, so the maternal allele of H19 is typically expressed. H19 is not translated and his main function is to regulate the expression of Igf2 (Insulin Growth Factor 2). Expression of H19 is negatively correlated with the expression of Igf2, so the paternal version of Igf2 is typically expressed, while the maternal is not. </p><p>In Wilm's tumor, there is loss of imprinting and the imprinting control region is hypermethylated also in the maternal allele. This doubles the expression of Igf2, which promotes tumor growth. This event occurs as early during tumorigenesis, suggesting that it may play in important role. </p><p><br /></p><p></p></div>
