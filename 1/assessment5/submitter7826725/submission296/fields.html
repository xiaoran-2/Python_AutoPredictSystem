    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation of Cytosine residues in CpG dinucleotides is one of the best studied DNA epigenetic modifications. CpG dinucleotides are clustered together into CpG-rich regions in the genome referred to as CpG islands. CpG islands are mainly located at the 5` end of genes and their immediate neighbouring regions, where most of time occupy promoters. CpG dinucleotides are also found at regions of repetitive elements as well as at intergenic regions. Under normal circumstances CpG islands are hypomethylated, but the CpG dinucleotides at repetitive elements and intergenic regions are heavily methylated. Hypomethylation of CpG islands relates to their active gene expression function while methylation of repetitive elements is needed to silence repeats thus preventing transposition and in turn genomic instability. Methylation of intergenic regions is required to avoid transcriptional interference by silencing cryptic transcription start sites.</p>

<p>In cancer cells, CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated while the opposite occurs at repetitive elements and at intergenic regions i.e. genome-wide hypomethylation. In cancers, hypermethylation of CpG islands most of the time affects tumour suppressor genes (e.g. RB in retinoblastoma) which causes silencing of their expression contributing to tumourigenesis. Tumour suppressor genes play key roles in cancer development and progression such as DNA repair and apoptosis and silencing of these genes can lead to tumour development by serving as one of the hits in the Knudson hypothesis.</p>

<span>DNA hypomethylation at repetitive elements and intergenic regions is associated with increased genomic instability by promoting harmful chromosomal rearrangements, activation and transposition of transposons to other genomic regions as well as activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighbouring genes as exemplified by Avy and Axinfu Alleles. In addition, hypomethylation of CpG of poor promoters can result in the activation of growth promoting genes such as R-RAS in gastric cancer.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is under genomic imprinting. At the paternal allele, the ICR and the CpG dinucleotides at the promoter of H19 are methylated and this prevents binding of the insulator protein, CTSF, to ICR as well as the expression of H19. This allows enhancers downstream of Igf2 to bind to the Igf2 promoter and express Igf2 from the paternal allele only. Contrastingly, at the maternal allele the ICR and the CpG dinucleotides at the promoter of H19 are unmethylated, and this allows binding of CTSF to its ICR as well as the expression of H19 from the maternal allele. Thus, enhancers downstream of Igf2 will not be able to bind to the Igf2 promoter as well as express Igf2 from the maternal allele.</p><p>

<span>In Wilm`s tumour, hypermethylation of ICR occurs on the maternal allele. This prevents binding of CTSF to the maternal ICR leading to enhancers binding to the Igf2 promoter and allowing expression of Igf2 from the maternal allele as well. We thus have a double dose of Igf2 expression due to its expression from both the paternal and maternal alleles. Igf2 being a growth factor leads<span> to the overgrowth of cells under its control.</span></span><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to DNA methyltransferase inhibitors that inhibit DNMT1, the maintenance DNMT. It is a nucleoside analogue which is incorporated in rapidly replicating DNA and irreversibly binds DNMT1 during the DNA methylation maintenance phase of DNA replication. Thus, DNMT1 is not able to maintain the methylation status of DNA and DNA methylation is progressively diluted with subsequent replication cycles.</p>

<span>Decitabine can have anti-tumour effects in haematological malignancies due to their dependency on tumour suppressor gene hypermethylation. Hypermethylated tumour suppressor genes are generally silenced resulting in increased expression and replication of tumour cells. By incorporating decitabine into rapidly dividing tumour cells, the methylation status of tumour suppressor genes can be reversed back to hypomethylation through the inhibition of DNMT1 in maintaining the methylation status of replicated tumour DNA. This activates the expression of tumour suppressor genes, helping them to function properly in controlling gene expression, DNA repair and cell division.</span><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can have long-lasting effects on the epigenome due to mitotic heritability of DNA methylation that allows it to be maintained through successive cell divisions. In cases of loci-specific DNA hypermethylation, for example mutated tumour suppressor genes, an initial hit that establishes an elevated methylation status is maintained through successive replication cycles by the maintenance DNMT1 which uses hemi-methylated DNA to completely lay down the new methylation status. Therefore the first hit that causes a change in the methylation status is perpetuated through every cell division.</p>

<p>The mammalian genome undergoes epigenetic sensitive periods where epigenetic marks are actively cleared and reset. This is also referred to as epigenetic reprogramming and it occurs in primordial germ cells development and during early embryonic development. During these periods, epigenetic marks from the maternal and paternal genome are rapidly removed, either passively or actively, and laid down again by the epigenetic machinery.  </p>

<p>Treating patients during these epigenetic sensitive periods has serious enduring effects because epigenetics marks laid down during these periods are needed for proper development of a foetus and functional gametes. Interfering with any of these periods can have disastrous consequences to an individual.  </p></div>
