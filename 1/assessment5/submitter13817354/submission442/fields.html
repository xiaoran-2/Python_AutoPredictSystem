    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are often located around the promoters of genes frequently
expressed in a cell. At these locations, the CG sequence is not methylated.<br />In cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the respective tumor suppressor.gene, which leads to cancer promotion through abrogation of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.<br />DNA methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive sequences keeps them inactive.<br />DNA in intergenic regions and repetitive elements tends to be hypomethylated in cancer cells.<br />Hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repeats promotes genomic instability because of: illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats followed by transposition, activation of cryptic promoters.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">There is DNA hypomethylation on paternal allele, Igf2 is expressed.<br />There is DNA hypermethylation on maternal allele,  Igf2 is not expressed and the maternal allele is normally inactive.<br />Igf2 imprinting is relaxed in Wilms' tumor. This loss of imprinting occurs when there is abnormal activation of the maternal copy of Igf2 and the resultant overexpression contributes to tumor growth.<br />IGgf expression is normally coordinately regulated with the maternally expressed H19
 gene that produces a noncoding RNA. In Wilms' tumor, maternal hypermethylation leading to biallelic Igf2 expression happens.<br />Abnormal activation of the maternal copy of Igf2 results in overexpression contributing to tumor growth.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypomethylating_agent"></a>It is a DNA-demethylating agent inhibiting DNA methytransferases.<br />It is a nucleotide analog that incorporates into DNA. This leads to a covalent binding with DNA 
methyltransferases and hypomethylation of DNA.<br />Methylation marks are then lost during replication.<br /> This may remove the silencing signals and activate the tumor suppressor genes.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Actively erased epigenetic marks do not appear in next generation of cells.<br />Sensitive periods are periods of development that is susceptible to environmental signals.This means periods of pre-implantation development and germ cell development.<br /> Treating patients during sensitive periods would mean erasion of epigenetics marks in all cells in future generation.<br /><br /><br /></div>
