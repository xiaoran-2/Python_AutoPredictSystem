    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value">CpG islands often occur as part of gene promoters and are normally not methylated (exceptions exist for example in X-inactivation). <br />An unmethylated CpG island in a promotor for a gene means the gene is expressed. Methylating it results in removing the promoting function and the gene will be silenced. <br /><br />As mentioned, CpG islands are normally not methylated. <br />In cancer the CpG islands  are hypermethylated and particularly at sites associated with growth suppressors, thereby silencing these genes and shutting off the cell's growth regulatory mechanism.<br /><br />DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements stabilizes the genome by reducing deletions, translocation and insertion mutations. In cancer, however, this DNA methylation is removed thus increasing the mutations so common in cancer cells.<br /><br /> </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The paternal allele shows methylation of the Imprint Control Region (ICR) and, through DNA methylation spreading, also in the H19 promoter. Due to the ICR methylation the insulator protein CTCF cannot bind to the paternal allele and the region's enhancers are able to act on Igf2 to enhance its expression. Igf2 is a growth promoter.<br /><br />The maternal allele shows neither ICR methylation nor H19 promoter methylation. CTCF can bind to the inmethylated ICR thus insulating the maternal copy of Igf2 with respect to the enhancers of the region. The enhancers will instead act on H19. Expression of Igf2 will be low.<br /><br />When more than the one paternal allele has a methylated ICR then Igf2 will be overexpressed and growth will be promoted. That is one component (both gene copies express Igf2) that leads to the Beckman -Wiedemann syndrome that among other effects increases the risk for Wilms tumour (in the kidney) in childhood. The direct cause is overexpression of growth promoters.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine (D) is an epigenetic drug that acts as a DNA-demethylating (or hypomethylating) agent. <br /><br />The effect of D is to remove methylation of DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. It may thus target the typical CpG island methylation in cancer and activate growth suppressors that fight cancers and inhibit the growth of tumours.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically inherited, so new cell generations will through DNMT1 action retain the methylation patterns of their parent cell generations. Changes in DNA methylation will thus have an enduring effect.<br /><br />Epigenetically sensitive periods are periods when the epigenetic marks are reprogrammed. They occur in early development before the epiblast formation and during primordial germ cell development. During these periods epigenetic marks are removed and then reset.<br /><br />Environmental factors including medical treatment during these sensitive periods may interfere with the reprogramming and cause permanent errors in the epigenome. (Such factors may include smoking, alcohol, malnutrition and epigenetical therapy.)</div>
