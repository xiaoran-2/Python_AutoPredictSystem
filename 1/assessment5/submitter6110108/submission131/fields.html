    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p><span>CpG
islands, cytosine bases followed by guanines (CpGs) generally clustered at the
promoters of tumour suppressor genes, are usually hypomethylated (unmethylated)
in normal cells allowing gene transcription, e.g. the activation of tumour
suppressor genes to prevent aberrant cell reproduction and proliferation throughout
the genome.  </span><span>In cancer these CpG islands are usually
hypermethylated (overmethylated) resulting in silencing of tumour suppressor
genes.  In this context DNA methylation is
mutagenic as it promotes aberrant transcription initiation and uninhibited cell
growth and reproduction.  As DNA is
mitotically heritable, being reproduced through daughter cells for the lifetime
of the organism, hypermethylation of CpG islands is a very effective way of
locking in a silent epigenetic state.  </span></p>

<p><span>Intergenic
regions and repetitive elements, non-coding DNA located between genes, are
usually hypermethylated. DNA hypermethylation at these sites helps to maintain
genomic integrity by preventing transposition, avoiding transcriptional
interference from strong promoters and preventing illegitimate
recombination.  In the context of cancer
intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated leading to
genomic instability.  There is
illegitimate recombination between repeats, deletions, insertions and
reciprocal translocations can occur because they are not packaged down into
heterochromatin.  Instead euchromatin is
created by the depletion of DNA methyltransferese allowing repeats the capacity
to jump around the genome or transpose, disrupt coding regions of the gene or
activate neighbouring genes.   </span></p>



<p><span>In summary,
the polarities of hypermethylation/hypomethylation of CpG isands on the one
hand and intergenic regions and repetitive elements on the other hand are
reversed in normal and abnormal cells. In normal cells CpG islands are
hypomethylated allowing transcription of tumour suppressor genes whereas in
cancer these genes are silenced and unable to suppress tumours.  In normal cells Intergenic regions and
repetitive elements are hypermethylated with associated genomic stability
whereas in cancer these areas are hypomethylated with associated instability. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Disrupted
imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster can contribute to cancer by over expression
of the insulin-like growth factor gene, Igf2, with no balance from the IncRNA
H19.  At this cluster the paternal allele
is normally methylated and devoid of CTCF binding complex which silences H19
expression allowing the enhancers access to, and uncontrolled expression of,
the Igf2 gene.   The imprint control
region on the maternal allele is normally unmethylated. The CTCF transcriptional
repressor acts as an insulator protein protecting Igf2 from downstream
enhancers allowing H19 expression.  This
acts like a brake on the growth promoting effect of Igf2 as expressed on the
paternal allele, keeping the epigenetic machinery in balance.  </span></p>



<p><span>When
imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilms tumour, both the
paternal and maternal alleles are, in effect, hypermethylated so uniparental
disomy is taking place with both alleles behaving like the paternal
allele.  Loss of imprinting, e.g. at the
H19/Igf2 cluster is a hallmark of cancer as Igf2, being expressed from both
alleles, acts like an oncogene, a growth promoter.  Without the balancing effect of H19 ‘putting
the brakes on’, Igf2 expression can become rampant and therefore cells begin to
multiple and divide uncontrollably. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine
is a DNA methyltransferese (DNMT) inhibitor, a nucleoside analogue with
antineoplastic activity and has a hypomethylation effect on DNA.  <span>Decitabine
inhibits the activity of EZH2, an enzyme that attaches methyl groups to histone
proteins and overactivity of this enzyme can lead to inappropriate
hypermethylation, e.g. silencing the transcription of tumour suppressor genes.  Decitabine is incorporated into the DNA on
replication and when DNMT1, an enzyme responsible for maintenance of DNA
methylation and cell replication comes along, it is bound irreversibly, unable
to be released to daughter cells on replication and therefore inhibits
inappropriate DNA methylation.  </span></p>

<p>Decitabine
can have an anti-tumour effect by reducing the hypermethylation of histone
proteins, relaxing the chromatin and allowing the surrounding tumour suppressor
genes to become activated; to do their job in stopping the uncontrolled growth
of cells that cause cancer. It is most effective in CpG island hypermethylated
myelodysplastic syndromes. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Altering DNA
methylation is one of the better understood mechanisms for epigenetic cancer
control.  When DNA methyltransferese
inhibitor drugs are used they are incorporated into the DNA during mitosis
preserving the methyl marks in an irreversible manner preventing inappropriate
transcription.  However, this application
may not be appropriate during sensitive periods when extensive epigenetic
reprogramming is taking place. </span></p>



<p><span>Sensitive periods
of development include during pregnancy and for a period of time pre and post
pregnancy when cells are growing and dividing rapidly.  Specific sensitive periods include during
early embryonic development when the intra and extra cellular tissue is
forming, and primordial germ cell development, when the male and female gametes
are forming.  Other sensitive periods are
during times of slow growth, i.e. 9-12 years for boys and 8-10 years for girls.  </span></p>



<p><span>Treating
patients with epigenetic drugs during sensitive periods would be inadvisable
because this is a time of rapid cell development, e.g. germ cells, and any significant
insult to the environment such as drug administration, has the potential to have
enduring effects on every cell in the body, inhibiting the epigenetic
machinery.   </span></p></div>
