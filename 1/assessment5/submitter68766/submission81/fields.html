    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are CpG clusters often at the promoters of genes. They tend to be protected from methylation. Methylation of the CpG islands causes silencing of a gene.</p>
<p>Cancer causes the CpG island to be hypermethylated and therefore silencing, e.g tumor suppressor genes.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated, to allow for genomic stability. In cancer intergeneric regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated. This causes genomic instability: deletions, reciprocal translocations and insertions at the internecine regions and transmission, transcriptional interference from strong promoter and illegitimate recombinations from the repetitive elements.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The paternal allele is methylated (paternally imprinted), therefore CTCF cannot bind. As a result the enhancers promote Igf2 expression in the paternal allele.</p>
<p>The maternal allele is unmethylated and the enhancers loop to H19 and enhance H19 expression.</p><p>H19 is a tumor supressor.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor the maternal and the parental allele a methylated. This causes an overproduction of Igf2.</p>
<p>Igf2 promotes growth, it's a oncogene. In the absence of the supressor H19, there is nothing to stop growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent and belongs to the class of DNMT inhibitors.<br /><br />Decitabine causes demethylation and restores in cancer the tumor suppressor genes to function again.<br />Treating lymphoma cancer with Decitabine results in a dramatic decline of <span>histone overmethylation.<br /><br />Decitabine  in cancer reverses the silencing of the tumor suppressor genes and allows therefore this change to be passed on during cell division until the original change is actively erased.  Also in some cases it allows lower doses of chemotherapeutic agents to be used.<br /></span><p><br /></p><p><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div><p>The hypermethylation of the DNA in cancer leads to silencing of the tumor suppressor genes.  Hence de-methylation is reversing this effect and should stop cancer without the need to kill the cells.  Basically the healthy state is re-established.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are periods in which the epigenetic marks are established rather then maintained, e.g. during embryogenesis or gametogenesis. Altered environments during sensitive periods can have an impact on epigenetic control.</p>
<p>If there is a lack of methylation due to the drug, the correct epigenetic marks cannot be established and therefore cause diseases.</p></div><div><br /></div></div>
