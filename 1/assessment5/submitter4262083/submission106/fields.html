    <div class="field-value"><p><span>As we learned in the
excellent lectures of U of Melbourne’s Professor Marnie  Blewitt, as well as other literature (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3480634/">Hassler and Egger,
2012</a>), there is a predictable shift in the distribution of DNA methylation across
the genome and CpG islands when normal cells change from normal to invasively cancerous.  The <b>interplay</b>
between the shifts is important. </span></p>

<p><span>Normally, DNA
methylation is typically NOT found at CpG islands. Rather, it’s distributed across
the rest of the genome. Together, this distribution pattern does much to
promote overall genetic stability and allows the expression of tumor-suppressing
genes. The combination keeps cells healthy this way:  </span></p>

<p><span>The methylation
across the genome works to keep repetitive elements, inter-genic regions and cryptic
promoters in a silent state.  This helps
keeps the genome and cell out of trouble. 
 The methylation in these areas
keeps these regions tightly packaged as heterochromatin, closed for replication,
and this state protects the genome from acquiring aberrant deletions, insertions
and reciprocal translations that might happen if the genes were in the more
open state that occurs when methylation leaves these areas (as it does in cancerous
processes).  </span></p>

<p><span>Also happening in
normal cells is the hypomethylation of the CpG islands. This allows the expression
of genes that suppress tumors.  </span></p>

<p><span>In cancer, as the
rest of the genome loses methylation, the CpG islands gain methylation. This
hypermethylation at the CpG islands gradually turns the tumor-suppressing genes
“off”. </span></p>

<p><span>So in the cancerous
process the increasing hypomethylation of the general genome results in increased
in genomic instability while there is simultaneous decrease of tumor
suppression. Acting together, this is like having a runaway cancer car with no—or
very little—braking power. <span>  </span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Dr. Blewitt explained
how disruption of the normal <b><i><u>a</u></i></b>symmetrical balance of DNA methylation
of Imprint Control Regions (ICRs) on parent-of-origin gene alleles contributes
to the development of cancer. Wilm’s tumor is a great example of abnormal <b><i>hyper</i></b>methylation
at ICRs.</span></p>

<p><span>In these patients, <b>both</b> parental alleles at the H19/Igf2
cluster are methylated—rather than just the paternal allele. Normally, the
paternal allele is the sole source of cell growth-promoting Igf2 expression.  Methylation of ‘Dad’s’ ICR silences the H19
gene and blocks the ICR-docking site for CTCF--which would otherwise insulate Igf2
expression enhancers. Epigenetically, paternal Igf2 is normally turned “on”.  </span></p>

<p><span>Balancing this, maternal
Igf2 expression is normally <b>silenced </b><i>via </i><b>hypo</b>methylation
of ‘her’ complementary ICR.  There is NO
methyl group blocking this site for CTCF. 
CTCF binds at the ICR and Igf2 is insulated from the action of the enhancers
that have an affinity for Igf2.  </span></p>

<p><span>In patients with
Wilm’s tumors, however, the maternal AND paternal ICRs are methylated. The
mothers’ allele mirrors the father’s and Igf2 which should be silenced on her
allele to counter-balance the father’s <i>isn’t.</i>  This cell is “double-dosed” (Blewitt) with
growth-promoting Igf2, an epigenetic state which contributes to cancerous
growth.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span><i>Decitabine</i> is a class of epigenetically-acting agents that is
variously described in sources but is probably best described as a <b>DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitor</b> (Blewitt;
</span><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3480634/">Hassler &amp;
Egger</a> 2012; <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18425818">Stresemann
and Lyco 2008</a><span><u>)</u>. </span></p>

<p><span>As we learned in Dr. Blewitt’s
lectures, in the haematological cancer for which this drug is approved,
abnormal cell growth is thought to be driven by hypermethylation of the CpG
islands which silences tumor suppressors and allows cancer to propagate.   With
this compound, hypermethylation of CpG islands is <i>removed</i> as the drug is integrated into the DNA.  This allows tumor suppression genes to be
turned back ON and its effectiveness is dependent on the replication of DNA in
parent to daughter to grand-daughter cells as the cells actively divide.  Presumably, then, the body’s natural tumor-fighting
defenses are thus enabled and this leads to the anti-tumor effect that has been
documented.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The <b>mitotic heritability</b> of epigenetic marks appears to be the key to
the enduring effects of DNA demethylation in the cancer treatment discussed in
the </span><a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168">Economist article</a><span><u>.</u><span> Once methylation is actively removed from the
epigenome, this unmethylated state is passed on from mother to daughter cells
and beyond through replication.  This demytheylated
state of the epigenome is maintained over time and does not return.   </span></span></p>

<p><span>Special caution is recommended with
the use of epigenetically-active medications during several highly sensitive periods
of germ cell development (including the time when girls’ ova are still maturing)
and periods of early embryonic development (pre-implantation and early-post
implantation).  These are sensitive times,
as Dr. Blewitt explained in her lectures, because the epigenome is being
reprogrammed with marks being stripped off and re-laid.  Medications that change the epigenetic state
during these  times could have consequences
for the cell and that could have a lasting, globally-acting impact for the patient.   There are also some limited times in adult
cell development in certain organs where similar epigenetic sensitivity exists.  In all, this is why treating patients during these
sensitive periods would be considered inadvisable. </span></p></div>
