    <div class="field-value">In cancer , there are several genetic mutations that might affect oncogene activation and lead into inactivation of tumor suppression. DNA methylation is part of abnormalities in epigenetic control. There are two types of DNA methylation abnormalities: DNA hipermethylation and genome hipomethylation. In normal cells CpG islands are found non methylated. In cancer cells, there are hipermethylation of CpG islands in consequence the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hipomethylated generating epigenetic silincing of tumor suppresors genes.  Hipomethylations of repeats intergenic intervals are associated with genomic instability and they can generate illegitimate recombination between repeats intergenic intervals such as reciprocal translocation, deletions and insertions. Likewise, hipomethylation due to delation of DNMT1  increases genomic instability in some tissues. CpG island methylations<span> accumulate over time and are mitotically heritable. </span><span>though much information has explored DNA methylation and Cancer development but molecular and epigenetics pathways have yet to be fully understood. </span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>We can find in the control imprint regions hipermethylations and hipomethylations that depends on gene´s functions. For instance, hipermethylation of imprint regions is in the Igf2/H19 cluster. So in this case, the paternal allele promoter region its methylated but the maternal allele is unmethylated , doing this to enhance  CTCF binding  protein to promoter, thus, act a long non conding RNA called H19 and not express Igf2 because its silent. But in the paternal allele that its methilated, the enhancers act Igf2 because theres not binding to CTCF. In contrast in tumor cells there are both alleles methylated with overexpression of Igf2 that is a growth promoting and it´s associated with wilms tumor.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a drug use in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome and avoid progress to <span>AML, its act againts DNA methyltransferase and produce hipomethylation. Decitabine is a nucleoside analogues, and bind irreversible DNMTs after incorporaded to DNA. Some agents DNMTi inhibit the activity of EZH2, a enzyme that bind methyl groups to histone. This enzyme is elevate in cancer as a consequence induce silent tumor supressor genes. A second target of some agents is an epigenetic regulator called BRD4 (bromodomain) bind to acetylate histone and at the same time inactivate Myc, a gene that </span><span>encodes a transcription factor involve in cancer.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetics therapies effect may go beyond the regular drug period of time because these modifications are mitotically inherited and methyl marks are preserved. A sensitive period its the time when an individual it´s more susceptible to environmental effects and its referred to early development like in utero. So is inadvisable to treat patients during sensitive periods because <span>epigenetic reprogramming occurs during development (pregnancy). </span></div>
