    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><i>Decitabine is a DNA - demethylating agents </i>that are histone -inhibitors by (epigenetic drugs) targeting the methylation .<br />The over-methylation of histones, in Cancer cells by an over-active enzyme EZH2 silences tumor-suppressor genes; who job is to stop uncontrolled cell growth (Economist: Caner Epigonome)<br />Decitabine an inhibitor slowed tumor growth by targeting the  tumor.<br /><b>Decitabine (small molecule target inhibitors) DNMTI inhibitors </b>treat "myelodysplastic syndromes appoved by FDA". (The Economist).<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">"Epigenetic changes passed on during cell division to daughter cells...granddaughter cells until erased" (The Economist) By epigenetic therapies /drugs can stop Cancer growing without killing the whole cell.<br />"Dr. Baylin ...epigenetic drugs altered tumor cells in some lasting way and made more progress when having chemotherapy" (The economist) .The epigenetic reprogramming during sensitive period of Primordial germ development and early development may have disruption in this period that can have lasing effects. When epigenetic marks are erased from the parent- of-origin and reset in the daughter cells.  <br />Disruption in epigenetic reprogramming at IVF ; Epigenetic marks and histone marks are removed between generations; The re-setting just before blastocyst; and in assisted-reproductive technologies there is a period that is sensitive whereby the  blastocyst stage; in when the transfer occurs for the cell division. Some evidence of "imprinted genes " DNA metyhylation occuring at small subset of genes during this period  of peri-conceptional /sensitive period. some altered transgeneration effect.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><u><b>The normal cell</b></u><b> at CpG islands is usually hypomethylated</b> (no
methylation) and the intergenic regions and also the repetitive elements, are
methylated ; whereas a <u><b>Cancer cell</b></u><b> is usually hypermethylated at the CpG
islands </b>and the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements are likely to be
hypomethylated </p>

<p><i>The DNA methylation of CpG islands contribute to cancer </i>by silencing the promotor tumor-suppressor
gene  and epigenetically silencing the tumor suppressor genes. The ‘Hudson
Hypothesis’ is such that multiple hits have to occur to the DNA for  it to contribute
to cancer genesis, activating oncogenes, taking out both copies of the tumor
suppressor genes.</p>

<p>Epigenetically
silencing /DNA methylation of tumor suppressor genes is important to create
oncogenisis.; CpG hypermethylation that occurs in all tumors as mitotic
heritabililty in silencing the genes.Biomarkers are detections of DNA
hypermethylation of the CpG islands.</p>

<p><i>Intergenic regions and
repeats</i> are hypomethylated; less methylation usually, however open chromatin
which leads to instability and occurace of transposons and also deletions and the activation of  illegitimate
recombinations such as insertions.</p>

<p>Drugs targeting
epigenetic inhibitors are content dependant; stages of the tumor/DNA methylation.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>

    <div class="field-value">Imprinted gene expression :- DNA methylation at Imprint control region does not mean silencing of the gene; Parent-of origin<br />in expression of the genes.It creates 'parent of origin 'expression in whether the  maternal alle or the paternal allele.  CTCF is an insulator protein it  insulates the Igf2 from downstream enhancers.  DNA methylation spreads to H19 promotor (long-non colding RNA )to silence the enhancers and then  it targets the  Igf2 to activate expression.<br />In Wilm's syndrome there is a loss of the tumour-suppressor genes; overgrowth. <br />Methylation at the ICR on the maternal allele insulates (cdkn1, tumor suppressor and  Igf2 activates I H19 in the maternal allele.<br />The Paternal allele at an ICR if methylated, CTCF is not binding and no insulation, so expression if from the paternal allele.<br />The ICR when DNA methylated is common with Cancer (active, over-growth and promoting ) tumor-suppressor genes. <br />In Wilm's syndrome there is a maternal transmission (parent-of-origin) expression; The inheritance pattern follow a maternal heritabilty whereby it can only show phenotype by maternal inheritance, paternal inheritance can only pass on carrier status.</div>
