    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands
in normal cells are usually umethylated and found in the promoters of some
genes. CpG islands' hyper methylation occurs really frequently in tumors. CpG
islands are found in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes and their hyper
methylation results to the silencing of the tumor suppressor genes, this way we have cell proliferation and no one tells them to stop.  Because DNA methylation is mitotically
heritable, this is a very effective way of silencing a tumor suppressor gene. This
is one of the hits that contribute to cancer, there are other malfunctions that have to occur in the same time in order to have cancer<span>.<br /><br />
Normally the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated in a
normal cell. This helps the cell to keep its genetic stability because
repetitive elements can copy themselves and jump into other regions of the
genome, activating cryptic promoters. Also these regions have the same sequence
with one region of another chromosome if they remain "open"
(euchromatin) this could lead to illegitimate recombination between non homologous
chromosomes. In a cancer cell these regions are hypo methylated this can lead
the cell into genetic instability. Deletions, insertions and reciprocal
translocations are some of the things that happen in an instable cell.</span></p><p><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Paternal
==&gt; ___Igf2 _____ICR (methylated) ____H19 (methylated)_____Enhancers__</p>

<p>On the paternal
chromosome as shown above the ICR is methylated so the CTCF protein can’t bind
on the ICR, this way the methylation spreads to the H19 promoter to silence it
and downstream enhancers can access Igf2 to activate.</p><p><span>Maternal
==&gt; ___Igf2 _____ICR(unmethylated)____H19(unmethylated)_____Enhancers__<br />
On the maternal chromosome as shown above the ICR and H19 are unmethylated so
the CTCF protein can bind on the ICR, this way the H19 promoter stays
unmethylated and expressed and Igf2 is insulated from downstream enhancers.</span></p><p>

</p><p><span>In Wilm's
tumor the maternal allele ICR is methylated and as a result we have double dose of Igf2 expression. <br /></span></p><p>Igf2 is a growth promoting factor,
and this excess of Igf2 in associated with Willm’s tumor (a childhood kidney
tumor). Growth promoting factros are promoting cell <span>proliferation.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>It belongs
to DNA-demethylating agents. Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor.
As decitabine inhibits methyltrasferases DNA methylation is not kept from one
cell generation to the next during cell proliferation so the next generation of
cells will be unmethylated. In most of the tumors CpG islands hypermethylation
occurs. CpG islands are found in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes. Once
they are umethylated these genes are expressed and this helps in tumor
suppressing.</p><p><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, with
DNA methyltransferases keeping the methylation on the DNA from one cell generation
to next generation. So altering DNA methylation with drugs is mitotically
heritable with this mechanism. A sensitive period is when the epigenetic marks
are being reestablished. Sensitive periods of development are during primordial
germ cell development and during preimplantation and early development.
Treating patients during these periods is inadvisable because altering DNA
methylation during these periods these epigenetic marks will be inherited to
next cell generations and this will affect the whole organism. </p>
