    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at promoter CpG islands normally functions to silence expression of the gene following the promoter. CpG islands in normal cells are usually hypomethylated, allowing the gene to be expressed. In cancer cells the CpG islands in promoters of tumour-suppressor genes become hypermethylated, causing these genes to be silenced. DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, therefore the tumour-suppressor genes remain silent in daughter cells. This epimutation is rapidly selected, resulting in a larger group of cells with inactive tumour-suppressor genes. These genes control the cell cycle and regulate cell growth and DNA repair, therefore when they are inactive the cells keep growing and dividing - they become cancerous. There is hypermethylation of sets of CpG islands in cancer, resulting in the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP). This is cancers where the CpG islands of a set of genes are frequently methylated, and is associated with clinically distinct tumours such as colorectal cancer.<br /><br />Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated; in both cases this is to maintain genomic integrity. In intergenic regions DNA methylation silences cryptic transcription start sites, and in repetitive elements it silences repeats to prevent transposition. The methylation of repeats may also prevent illegitimate recombination. However, in cancer cells there is hypomethylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements, resulting in genomic instability. This may cause illegitimate recombination between repeats (due to the lack of methylation), the activation of repeats and their transposition, and the activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes in cancer cells.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the H19/Igf2 cluster on the paternal allele, the imprint control region (ICR) is methylated. This DNA methylation spreads to the H19 promoter, causing expression of the H19 gene to be silenced. The methylation at the ICR blocks the binding of the insulator protein CTCF, therefore allowing downstream enhancers to access the Igf2 gene to activate it. The paternal allele therefore expresses the Igf2 gene - it is paternally imprinted. On the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated. This allows CTCF to bind, insulating Igf2 from the downstream enhancers so that it is not expressed. The enhancers are therefore free to act on H19 and enhance its expression.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumour, there is hypermethylation of the ICR at the H19/Igf2 cluster on the maternal and the paternal allele, resulting in overexpression of Igf2 as CTCF can no longer bind to the ICR on the maternal allele. Igf2 is a growth factor, therefore its overexpression may result in the increased cell growth that is characteristic of cancer cells.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the class of epigenetic inhibitors which inhibit DNMT (DNA methyltransferase). Decitabine irreversibly binds to DNMTs after they are incoorporated into the DNA. This inhibition of DNMT will result in DNA hypomethylation as DNMT cannot lay down DNA methylation. If tumour-suppressor genes are methylated, they become silenced and cannot prevent tumour growth. However, methylated tumour-suppressor genes that are exposed to Decitabine will be demethylated, causing them to become active again and restoring their normal function. DNMT inhibitors such as Decitabine are replication dependent, therefore the tumour cells will be more severely affected and demethylated as they replicate rapidly. They will therefore be able to control cell growth and have an anti-tumour effect.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, as the enzyme DNMT1 maintains the CpG methylation through somatic cell divisions. It recognises hemi-methylated DNA and, after replication, methylates cytosines in the newly synthesised daughter strands to maintain DNA methylation (it is therefore a stable mark). This means that alterations in DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome in daughter somatic cells.<br /><br />A sensitive period is a period of active epigenetic reprogramming where the epigenetic marks are removed and specific epigenetic marks are laid down (specific to different cell types). The sensitive periods in humans are early development when DNA methylation and histone marks are removed (this reaches the lowest point of marks at the blastocyst stage before implantation), and primordial germ cell development when somatic cell epigenetic marks are removed and the marks required for sperm cells and ooctyes are laid down. During sensitive periods, treating patients would be inadvisable as altered chemical environments (due to drugs) in the cells can alter the epigenetic marks that are laid down and can therefore have an enduring effect throughout the patient's life, as well as possibly affecting their germ cells and therefore future children.<br /></div>
