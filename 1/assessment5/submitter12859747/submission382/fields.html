    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value">Normally, CpG islands retain unmethylated status; however, a small subset of islands are dynamically methylated between cell types. <br />Cancer involves, along with oncogene activation, the inactivation of tumor repressors. If the CpG islands near the promoter region get methylated, this can lead to the silencing of crucial genes; Hypermethylation at CpG islands can silence tumor repressors. Because the tumor repressors are inactivated, tumors can grow freely. <br /><br />However, most DNA methylation occurs in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. It helps to maintain genomic integrity.<br />In cancer, hypomethylation occurs in these intergenic and repetitve regions and occurs in almost every tumor and progresses with time. Genomic instability/repeats stemming from hypomethylation cause cancer.<br /><br />Hypomethylated, CpG-poor promoters are associated with the activation of oncogenes, another factor of cancer. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">On the H19/Igf2 maternal chromosome, the imprinted control region is unmethylated, while on the paternal chromosome, it is methylated, meaning that lgf2 is genomically imprinted through the paternal allele. Since the paternal chromosome does not have the CTCF bound to it, the enhancers can act on Igf2 and allow for it to be expressed. The paternal allele only expresses Igf2, not the maternal allele. In Wilm's tumor, Igf2 imprinting is disrupted since H19 and Igf2 are transcribed from both the maternal and paternal alleles. Less Igf2 means more H19. H19, which is normally expressed on the maternal chromosome, loses its imprinting due to overexpression  (<a href="http://www.nature.com/scitable/content/model-of-loss-of-imprinting-of-igf2-38079" title="Link: http://www.nature.com/scitable/content/model-of-loss-of-imprinting-of-igf2-38079">source</a> for all above). H19 is an oncogene and regulates gene expression (high quantity of active oncogenes = cancer.) <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating or hypomethylating agent, meaning that it inhibits the enzyme DNA methyltransferase. Since it prevents DNA methylation, CpG islands cannot become hypermethylated, allowing the tumor repressors to be active and prevent tumor growth. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation during a sensitive period, either forcibly through a drug or through uncontrollable environmental factors, leaves long-lasting transcriptional effects. In younger patients and pregnant women, taking a drug during a sensitive period where the germ cells of either the patient or a fetus are vulnerable could affect the development of these cells, as well as alter gene expression/transcription.</div>
