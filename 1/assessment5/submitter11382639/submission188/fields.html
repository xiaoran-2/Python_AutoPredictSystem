    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is generally associated with decrease in the expression of a region.<br />Many CpG islands are promoter regions. In normal cells they are largerly unmethylated and the associated genes are expressed. <br />In cancer CpG islands are often hypermethylated. Methylation of CpG islands within promoters silences genes, particularly tumour suppressor genes, with functions such as DNA repair and the death of cells with damaged DNA.<br /><br />DNA methylation in repetitive elements is involved in the stability of the genome,<br />Hypomethylation leads to instability in the genome - insertions, deletions, transpositions and translocations ie damage to the genome. Transpositions may lead to activation of neighbouring genes or disruption of areas where they are added.<br /><br />Methylation in the intergenic regions is involved in the silencing of promoter regions, in imprinting so that only one of a pair of alleles is expressed and silencing of other areas.<br /><br />These areas are generally, but not always, less methylated in cancers (hypomethylation).<br />Unmethylated promoters may become active, either allowing an oncogene to be over-expressed, expressing a protein that acts against a tumour suppressor or allowing over-expression of a growth promoter.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The cluster consists of H19 and Igf2 genes, an insulater region, a promoter region and some enhancers. <br />The H19 is only expressed on the maternal allele in normal tissue. The cluster is unmethylated on the maternal allele, so CTCF binds the insulator and the enhancers are active on H19 and the Igf2 is silenced.<br />The cluster is methylated on the paternal allele, so the insulator is not active, allowing  the enhancers act on the Igf2 gene and it is expressed. <br />H19 is a growth restrictor and Igf2  is a growth promoter and so in a normal cell there is a balance between the two factors.<br />In Wilm's tumour there is loss of imprinting on the maternal alleles which means that it is also methylated and expressing Igf2.<br />With twice as much Igf2  being expressed, and H19 not, it contributes to tumour growth.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent.<br />It inhibits DNA methyltransferase by being incorporated into the DNA while it is replicating, then binding the DNMT irreversibly.<br />In cancer cells DNMT increases methylation of tumour suppressor genes silencing them, so Decitabine removes DNMT from the system allowing the tumour suppressor genes to be expressed again.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically stable, that is, it is passed down to daughter cells, so the therapies will have lasting effects. These drugs are not tissue selective, so can interfere with the functioning of epigenome in normal cells.<br />A sensitive period is a time during which epigentic reprogramming is happening. In particular during pregnancy and the few weeks before, while the gametes are being formed in early development and during puberty.<br /></div>
