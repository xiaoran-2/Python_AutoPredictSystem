    <div class="field-value"><b>Methylation in Cancer cells is altered by an overall<i> reversal of function</i>. Areas normally unmethylation are hyper methylated; areas usually methylated and holding things in place, are silenced and this sets the cells up for instability. <br /><br />Normal function  at the CpG islands is the absence of methylation. the area remains open and accessible and is used for transcription and modifications of the DNA.  </b> <i><br /></i><i><br /></i><b>In Cancer there is a reversal at the CpG islands --- as if a switch were turned on where it was turned off, and turned off where it had always been turned on. </b><br /><br /><b>The disruption of Methylation at the CpG islands by methylating areas usually  not methylated, leads to the silencing of  tumor-suppressor genes. Once this control is lost, Cancer can begin its growth. This disruption also creates genome-wide instability. And this epigenetically-inheritable silencing, gives Cancer a strong tool to lock down the hypermethylated state of the CpG islands and to begin cell instability.   <br /></b><br /><b>The normal, and critical role of DNA methylation has been to silence and hold in check the transposable elements: the critical 30% to 35% of the Genome. T</b><b>he deregulating of these protective areas --- especially the areas where something is being held down --- when these areas are opened deregulated --- this is where cancer gains a critical advantage.</b><br /><i><br /></i><b>The intergenic regions are disrupted by a lack of methylation. these site are usually kept silenced. This tamping down of these areas is important because there are many intergenic sites in the Genome.<br /><br />The intergenic regions are where the transposable elements, the repetitive sequences, the LINE and Retroviruses and point mutation are located.  when these elements jump and transpose themselves other place this creates a genome-wide instability.  Repeats appear in places --- where they shouldn't be all of this creates cell instability. </b></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><b>At the paternal allele the H19 is methylated and the Igf2 gene is expressed. The control of the Igf2 comes from the maternal H19.</b></p><p><b>The
maternal allele is unmethylated; this pattern allows the H19 lcRNA to control the Igf2 gene. The H19 controls the Igf2 growth.  </b><b>The
maternal allele becomes methylated like the paternal allele; this
allows the Igf2 gene to be expressed  instead
of the H19 which usually surpresses the igf2 gene (a
growth factor gene)</b></p><p><b>There is a loss of
imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster which leads to a loss of growth control. Without the H19 there controlling thngs, the Igf2 gene is free to grow without
restriction.</b></p><b>
</b><p><b>When a gene is
imprinted there is usually a mono allelic expression. This means only
one of the two alleles is expressed. At the H19Igf2 cluster both
alleles of the gene are being expressed.</b><br /></p><b>
</b><p><b>The expression of H19
controls the expression of the Igf2. In Wilm's tumor H19
expression is lost. Instead, the maternal allele just as the paternal allele
is being expressed – a double expression.</b><br /></p><b>
</b><p><b>The disruption of imprinting at the cluster leads to uncontrolled growth which allows for tumor growth. </b></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><b>Decitabine is a De-Mythelating Agent and is also an Anti-Metabolite. Decitabine works by interfering with the normal methylation of the cell. This demethylation brings back cellular control, and reactivates <i>the tumor suppressor genes.</i> this restores normal cell activity; the regulators of the cell return. <br /><br />Decitabine hypomethylates DNA; this inhibits the DNA methytransferases from working.<br />Decitabine is also an antimetabolite. this part of the drug works on the architecture of the cell.<br /><br />The Anti-Tumor affect comes from restoring the controls and stability to the cell. The tumor suppressors that were silenced are now operational; this returns normal cell growth and normal apoptosis. The nuclear structure of the cell becomes normal too.</b></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><b>The cells inherit things mitotically; once a drug is administered, the cell's epigenetics are affected and the event is remembered by all the cells; each time the cells divides, each cell retains the epigenetic information. This has an enduring affect on the organism and ALL the cells of the body.</b><i><br /><br /></i><b>Sensitive periods are when the cells are going through primordial changes, activation and deactivation of methylation marks.   Sensitive points in development are during Germ Cell development when imprinted genes are being cleared and reset or removed. <br /><br />During the sensitive periods genes are being imprinted and methylation marks are being removed and some are being silenced, treatment during these sensitive periods could clear the imprinting and remove these marks.  </b></div>
