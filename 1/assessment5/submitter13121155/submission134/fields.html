    <div class="field-value">At most CpG islands in the genome, the C5 of cytosine nucleotides is protected from silencing and remains unmethylated to allow gene expression, when these CpG islands are methylated it results in gene silencing. This occurs frequently in cancer cells, where CpG islands are hypermethylated, resulting in gene silencing.  The genes silenced through this epigenetic mechanism in cancer are likely tumour suppressor genes, and therefore their silencing contributes to the development of the cancer.  DNA methylation at intergenic regions functions to maintain genomic integrity, possibly by silencing cryptic transcription start sites which could disrupt the transcription of other genes.  DNA methylation at repetitive elements also helps maintain genomic stability by silencing these repeats to prevent mutagenic effects such as translocation and illegitimate recombination, and to prevent expression from cryptic promoters and transcriptional interference.  In cancer, genome-wide DNA methylation decreases, and this occurs in these intergenic regions and repetitive elements (hypomethylation). As a result there is a loss of genome stability and integrity as illegitimate recombination occurs, transposons are activated and cryptic promoters disrupt normal neighbouring gene expression.  Aberrant gene expression and mutagenic events such as illegitimate recombination and transposon mutagenesis certainly contribute to cancer inherently by causing mutations and chromosomal instability. In healthy cells, chromosomal translocations would be detected and apoptosis would be initiated to prevent cell division and spread of the problem; however, cancer cells progress through division due to the combining effects of chromosomal instability and likely oncogene expression as well as tumour suppressor silencing due to CpG hypermethylation at their promoters.  Overall, hypermethylation of tumour suppressor CpG island promoters, and the hypomethylation of the rest of the genome (which requires DNA methylation to maintain genetic instability) can lead to the development of cancer.  </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the H19/Igf2 cluster, the methylation pattern of the paternal and maternal allele differ.  The paternal allele is methylated at the ICR (imprint control region), which prevents the binding of CTCF at the ICR.  This allows the spreading of DNA methylation to the H19 promoter, silencing H19 expression.  The silencing of H19 allows the downstream enhancers to act on Igf2, resulting in increased Igf2 expression (and decreased H19 expression).  The maternal allele is unmethylated at the ICR, allowing the binding of CTCF.  This allows the expression of H19, which is acted upon by the downstream enhancers.  On the maternal allele, H19 expression is increased, but there is not expression of Igf2, as CTCF acts as an insulator protein, insulating Igf2 from the effect of enhancers. Wilm's tumour is a childhood tumour which is a  common symptom of Beckwith Weidemann (B-W) Syndrome.  In this syndrome, the Igf2 gene may be expressed at a higher level because both alleles behave like the typical paternal allele, as imprinting has been disrupted.  In these cases, both alleles have DNA methylation at the ICR. Igf2 is an oncogene, and therefore over-expression is certainly associated with proliferation and cancers, including Wilm's tumour seen in B-W patients.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the DNA-demethylating class of epigenetic inhibitors.  It's demethylating action is DNA-replication-dependent, as it is a nucleoside analogue.  It decreases DNA methylation in the genome when it is incorporated into the DNA during replication, and is then bound by DNMT1 as it attempts to methylate the analogue base.  DNMT1 is irreversibly bound and therefore cannot methylate other sites in the genome, nor can that site be methylated by another DNMT1 as it is permanently blocked.  As DNA hypermethylation at CpG islands of tumour suppressor gene promoters contributes to cancer, removing this DNA methylation through the use of Decitabine can allow expression of these genes and can have an anti-tumour effect through this way.  These tumour-suppressor genes can do exactly what their name implies, and inhibit cell proliferation in this manner.  This treatment is most effective in myelodysplastic syndromes which lead to acute myelogenous leukaemia.  </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable; as such, changes to DNA methylation patterns in t a cell can have lasting effects on descendent cells as well.  As cancer cells grow and divide more rapidly than normal somatic cells, this is even more critical, as these marks affect many cells.  Despite a short treatment interval, the epigenome of the cell descendents remain modified after treatment.  These drugs could have harmful effects if applied sensitive periods.  Obviously, sensitive epigenetic periods include early embryonic development and primordial germ cell development; however ,in terms of patients to treat the most critical sensitive periods would be between the ages of 8-10 and 9-12 for girls and boys, unless the patient in question was pregnant, at which point ED and PGCD would be sensitive periods to avoid.   ED and PGCD are sensitive as they are times when epigenetic marks are removed and re-applied to the genome, and these marks are inherited by all descendent cells. The sensitive periods for children are such because they are so-called periods of 'slow growth' and they are still developing/growing.  Treating patients during these times could result in aberrant epigenetic marks and potentially altered gene expression, especially during PGCD and ED.</div>
