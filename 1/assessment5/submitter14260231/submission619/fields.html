    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Although in normal cells CpG islands are not methylated, in cancer cells a high level of DNA methylation is observed in CpG islands, leading to gene silencing. This hyper methylation occurs at tumor suppressor genes, genes that do not allow cancer to evolve.Their inactivation by DNA hyper methylation at CpG islands leads to cancer. In normal cells, the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements are under normal conditions methylated.However, in cancer the reciprocal is true:intragenic regions as well as repetitive elements are hypo methylated.This phenomenon leads to genomic instability, a common feature of cancer.Insertions or deletions of whole chromosome regions are observed disrupting the normal function of genes.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>One example of how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer is the disruption of imprinting cluster H19/Igf2 that can leads to Wilm'tumour, a type of renal cancer presented in paediatric patients. Under normal conditions, the H19/Igf2 cluster genes are normally expressed from the maternal allele while on the paternal allele there are silenced. In Wilm's tumour, the imprinting region is severely affected at the paternal allele and as a result , the paternal allele expresses the Igf2 gene leading to over expression of Igf2.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>One of the currently available drugs affecting epigenetic mechanisms in cancer is decitabine. Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent that inhibits DNA hyper methylation at CpG islands of tumour suppressor genes, leading to their activation.Tumour suppressor genes are normally involved in restricting the emergence of tumour cells and their activation by a DNA demethylating agent such as decitabine, explains the mechanism this drug exerts its anti-tumour effect.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Drugs affecting the epigenome of an organism can have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment. This is a phenomenon that can be attributed to the mitotic heritability of alterations in the DNA methylation pattern of an organism. Alterations in DNA pass from mother to daughter to granddaughter until they are actively erased. however, it is not advised to treat a patient with drugs affecting epigenome during permordial germ cell formation or during pre-implantation. Thus, it is not advisable for women trying to get pregnant and even pregnant women to be treated with drugs affecting the epigenome since they are sensitive periods of the life cycle and the consequences affect the next two generations.</span></div>
