    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation of promoter regions suppress gene expression but the CpG islands are usually kept free of methylation independent of their activity state. However, in cancer cells, in the promoter regions there is hyper DNA methylation of CpG islands and CpG island shores of tumor suppressor genes which then causes silencing of the tumor suppressor gene. In a normal cell there is methylation of the intergenic and repetative elements thus methylating the long terminal repeats  which silences the expression of transposons or oncogenes thereby maintaining  genomic integrity but in case of tumors there is hypomethylation of these regions thus causing the expression of the oncogenes/ transposons which disrupt the integrity of the DNA by deletion, translocation or insertion thus leading to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">When there is methylation of the Imprint control region on the paternal allele it leads to the CTCF not insulating the imprint control region thus allowing the enhancers to express the IGF2. However in the normal maternal allele there is no methylation thus the CTCF insulates the imprint control region thus allowing the the expression of H19 and silencing the expression of IGF2. But in wilms tumor there is methylation of the maternal allele as well where by there is no insulation of the maternal imprint control region thus there is expression of the IGF2. This double dose expression of the IGF2 leads to loss of expression of tumor suppressor genes and increase in expression of oncogenes thus leading to the formation of Wilm's tumor.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. DNA demethylating agent are nucleoside analogues which are incorporated into the DNA on replication thus preventing the binding the DNA methyltransferase to the CPG dinucleotide , thus preventing copying of the methylation to the daughter cell. The DNA methyltransferase is irreversibly bound to the nucleotide decreasing the hypermethylation of the CPG islands and increasing the expression of tumor suppression genes. Since the drug acts in a division dependent way and the cancer cells that are replicated without restriction are the ones being affected the most. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable, hypermethylation or hypomethylation of the DNA can lead to expression or silencing of the gene, which can be passed down to offspring unless actively erased thus affecting the epigenome. Sensitive period is where altered environment has an affect on epigenetic control. These sensitive periods of developments include primordial cells to gamete formations and then from pre implantation to post implantions which are the active remodelling period of the genome.During this phase there is removal and insertion of new epigenetic marks and treating during this phase may lead to removal or insertion of epigenetic marks that may detrimental and may cause trangenerational  inheritance of epigenetic marks.</div>
