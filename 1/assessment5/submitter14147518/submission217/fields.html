    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA is often hypomethylized in CpG islands which are often
found in most promoters while most of the CpG regions within somatic mammal
cells are methalized. This is cell specific so that each cell type only uses
the set of the genome it needs to operate. Cancer seems to lead to methylization
of the CpG islands, resulting in silencing of the underlying gene. This can
cause transcribing proteins, such as tumor suppressing proteins, which control
the replication cycle and DNA repair, to be shut down, reducing the cell’s
ability to control unbounded growth and combat mutagenic affects. A good
example of this is in a type of colo-rectal cancer. Normally, intergenic
regions are methylized to only activate key proteins that are relevant to the
tissue type. Cancer also results in progressive demethylization or
hypomethylization of the intergenic regions. This has several impacts. Within
highly expressed genes, intergene CpG locations are methalized to inhibit
accident transcription in the middle of the gene or antisense transcription.
Methylization is also found in repeats and retroviral insertions to inhibit
transcription. Demethylization associated with cancer can activate these
regions, opening up more euchromatin and destroying the differentiation of the
cell and often making it able to replicate and grow into areas its somatic
parent cell was prevented by the methylization pattern it contains. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, the paternal allele is methylated, suppressing
the H19 tumor suppressor, but, in turn activating the transcription of the Igf2
which supports cell growth. At the maternal allele, however, the ICR upstream
from the H19 is hypomethylated, resulting in the promotion of the H19 tumor suppressor,
but inhibiting the transcription of Igf2. In Wilm’s tumor, both the parental and
maternal alleles are methylated, resulting in the inhibiting of the H19 tumor
suppressor and double the expression of the Igf2. The net result is the
elimination of a tumor suppressor and the double expression of a growth factor,
resulting in increased reproduction of the cell and rapid growth, resulting in
a tumor.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine in a hypomethylating agent that works through inhibiting
the function of demethyltransferase (DMT). DMT is an enzyme that helps to
retain methylization during cell mitosis. By deactivating the enzyme.
Methylization that has been added by cancer in CpG islands that inhibits tumor
suppressors can be removed in the formation of daughter cells formed by mitosis.
The lack of DMT will tend to hypomethylate the daughter cell genome. In some
cancers, such as Acute Myaloid Leukemia, the methylization of the CpG islands
turns off tumor suppressing genes, allowing unconstrained growth of the cancer
cells. Demethylizing the daughter cells will reactivate these genes, slowing
the growth and leads to a reduction of the cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylization normally starts to occur in the development
of the fetus after the blastosphere stage. The methylization and other
epigenetic marks help tissues differentiate and shut down as much as 80% of genes in
the cell, allowing specialization. In addition epigenetic marks are used to shut down
on X chromosome in women and implement imprinting of alleles from a preferred
parent. Cancer cells tend to remove this methylization in intergene regions and
add it in CpG islands resulting in the creation of unconstrained growth in
tumors. Because methylization is passed on through mitosis, once a cell is
differentiated, the daughter cell inherits those markers. During the “sensitive
period” which includes the formation of germ cells through the formation of the
blastocyst, the cells actively erase the epigenomic changes to create pluripotent
cells that can differentiate into any tissue. Thus, using drugs that modify DNA
methylization should be avoided during early  pubescence, when germ cells are being
developed in the body and between conception and the blastocyst stage in pregnancy.
Otherwise, cells may not correctly form their epigenetic code, resulting in cancers,
tumors, lack of development and differentiation, etc.</p>
