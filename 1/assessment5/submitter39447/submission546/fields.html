    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value">In normal cells most CpG islands are unmethylated. The methylation of CpG islands is associated to condensed chromatin structures, that don't allow transcription factors to bind, and therefore with silencing of nearby gene expression.<br /><br />In cancer CpG islands that are usually not methylated can appear to be methylated and cause silencing of tumor suppresor genes.<br /><br />In normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be methylated, which represses their expression. This mechanism is a protection and a source genomic stability. Indeed repetitive elements are associated with transposons and retrotransposons, if expressed they can move in the genome and cause alteration of DNA structure (insertion, deletion, translocation, kariotype anomaly...). Also the promoters associated to these elements are strong promoters that could enhance expression of nearby genes, which could be oncogenic genes.<br /><br />Cancer is associated with genome wide hypomethylation, therefore intergenic regions and repetitive elements are not repressed, leading to genomic instability.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNMT (methyltransferase) inhibitor. It acts when the cell is replicating, and therefore it has only an effect on dividing cells. Since cancer cells divide more, they are more affected.<br />By inhibiting DNMT, the DNA methylation is not maintained at replication (or less), leading to progressive dilution of methylation. The daughter cells become hypomethylated.<br />Decitabine can have an anti-timour effect because tumor suppressor genes are often hypermethylated (=silenced) in cancers, they can be reactivated by demethylation.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, therefore the methylation is maintained through cell division. Any modification can be maintained during the lifetime of the person.<br />Sensitive periods are periods where the DNA methylation is modified (removed and set up again). It happens twice, during early embryogenesis and during early primordial germ cells development.<br />A treatment during sensitive periods could have lifetime effects (because of mitotic heritability) and could have consequences on the next generation because of impact on primoridal germ cell development, and even of the generation after for pregnant women, because of the development of primordial germ cells in the baby during pregnancy.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">H19 is a Long non-coding RNA (LncRNA) which expression inhibits the expression of lgf2 in cis (on the same chromosome).<br />H19 expression is controlled by an ICR (Imprint Control Region). When the ICR is methylated, H19 is not expressed.<br />In the paternal genome the ICR is methylated, repressing H19 expression, that therefore cannot repress the expression of lgf2, which is then expressed.<br />In the maternal genome the ICR is not methylated and thus H19 is expressed, leading to repression of lgf2 expression.<br />In Wilm's tumour, both the paternal and maternal ICR are methylated, therefore both lgf2 genes are expressed (the maternal is expressed like the paternal allele). lgf2 is a growth promoter, which overexpressed leads to kidney tumor in children.<br /><br /><br /></div>
