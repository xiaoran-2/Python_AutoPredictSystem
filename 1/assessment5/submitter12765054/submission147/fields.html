    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Generally CpG island determine if a gene is silenced or active, these CpG islands can be methylated, silencing a gene, or unmethylated were the gene is active. </div><div>In normal cells this tends to be hypometylated, and in cancer cells these CpG islands tend to be hypermethylations.</div><div>Some CpG islands are found in promoters of tumour suppressor genes and if those are hypermetylated the suppressors are silenced and the cell can evolve to a cancerigenous cell.</div><div>The methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements will silence these genes, in cancer cells it tends to be hypomethylated meaning these genes aren't silenced anymore by the methylations and could be expressed.</div><div>These genes can be oncogenes and so contributing to cancer if expressed.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Igf2 control region is methylated on the paternal allele, and it's unmethylated on the maternal allele. </div><div>If the control region is methylated then the enhancers can work normally and promote the expression of the Igf2 gene.</div><div>If the control region is unmethylated then the enhancers can't work normally since the CTCF will bind with these control region and instead of acting on the gene Igf2 the enhancers will act on the H19 gene, expressing this one.</div><div>The imprinting can be disrupted by hypermetylation of the control region making both alleles act as if they were parental ones and no allele from the mother. </div><div>This will cause double expression of Igf2 without expression of H19 and this will cause the wilm's tumour. Igf2 is a growth promoting gene and an oncogene if overexpressed, normally cancer cells are hyperplasic, characteristic that can be caused by these gene</div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. </div><div>Decitabine when administrated it will most likely act on the hypermtylated CpG islands, taking those methylation marks making them hypomethylated CpG islands.</div><div>those CpG islands that are hypermethylated in cancer cells inibit genes that could impede cancer, like genes that control the growth of the cell, that causes apoptosis or even genes that limit the cell division. in that in mind these drug can have an anti-tumour effect.</div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>The epigenetic changes are inheritable, the cells maintain the changes to their daughter cells and those to theirs daughter cells and so on. Making these types of drugs very effective, since cancer cells divide rapidly.<br /></div><div>There are two sensitive periods, the first during preimplantation development and the second during germ cell development, during these periods the cells will suffer from epigenetic reprograming and they are more susceptible to factors that changes the epigenetic marks from these cells.</div><div>Patients that have developing germ cells shouldn't do these treatments because they have developing oocytes or sperm cells and these drugs could influence them drastically, these changes could influence the future embryo that they would form.</div><div><br /></div></div>
