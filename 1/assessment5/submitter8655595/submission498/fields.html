    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value">In normal cells CpG islands are hypomethylated (there is less methylation) while in cancer cells CpG islands "gain" methylation and become hypermethylated. The level of CpG methylation grows gradually with the progression of cancer (the further the tumor stage the higher the level of CpG methylation). These CpG islands are often localized in the promotor regions of tumor supperesor genes. Hypermethylation of these regions can cause epigenetic inactivation/silencing of the tumor supressor(s). The loss of tumor suppressors can make cancer cells divide more rapidly and make them less susceptible to apoptosis.<br />Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated in normal cells but hypomethylated in cancer cells (the opposite situation to CpG islands). The hypomethylation happens early and progresses with time during tumor development. Methylation of repetitive elements and intergenic regions allows maintenance of genomic stability. It prevents repetitive elements from illegitimate recombination. Hypomethylation of these regions in cancer cells can result in reciprocal translocation. Hypomethylation of repetitive elements can also activate the elements themselves allowing them to transpose throughout the genome and disrupt other genes or this hypomethylation can activate neighbouring genes leading to transcriptional aberrations.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The imprint control region is methylated on a paternal allele and unmethylated on a maternal allele. On a maternal allele the lack of mathylation allows binding of CTFC to the control region (insulator) which prevents interaction of enhancer elements with<em> Igf2</em> gene and its transcription. In this case enhancer elements can act on <em>H19</em>. Therefore, the<em> Igf2</em> on maternal allele is silenced. On a paternal allele insulator element is methylated and CTFC can not bind allowing enhencer regions to act on<em> Igf2</em> and facilitate its transcription. The<em> Igf2</em> is active on a paternal allele.<br />In Wilm's tumor hypermethylation of the imprint control region is observed on the maternal allele. So CTFC can bind to neither allele and<em> Igf2</em> is expressed from both copies of the gene. There is double dose of Igf2 protein, which is a growth promoting protein therefore it gives advantage to tumor cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is DNA-demethylating agent. This nucleoside analogue can decrease methylation level of DNA by inhibiting activity of DNMTs (DNA methyltransferases). It is division dependant so cancer cells which proliferate more rapidly are more severely affected by its action. The effect is tumor cell death. It is used in myelodysplastic syndrome which depends on tumor suppressor gene hypermethylation. The drug can decrease the level of methylation therefore restoring (at least partially) expression of tumor suppressor protein(s).</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation status is mitotically heritable. Therefore, if we alter DNA methylation status it can be passed to daughter cells.<br />Moreover if we alter methylation during one of sensitive periods it can be passed to offspring. Sensitive periods are periods when epigenetic marks are actively/passively removed or laid down. During development there are several periods of epigenetic reprogramming/remodelling:<br />- in germ cells development (in embryo)<br />- in early pre-implantation development in a zygote - removal of epigenetic marks<br />(- also during differentiation of particular stem cells).<br />Treating patients during such periods can lead to failure in appropriate epigenetic reprogramming which can effect in various disorders.<br /><br /></div>
