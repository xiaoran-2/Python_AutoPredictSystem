    <div class="field-value">Methylation describes the process of adding a methyl group on a cytosine, which in mammals is followed by a Guanine; these regions are the so-called CpG islands. When localized in a promotor gene, methylation is normally related to gene expression. Nevertheless, when promoter regions are hypermethylated, the result is normally the silencing of the gene. In cancer cells, not only does hypermethylation occurs, but it has also a different pattern than in normal cells; in cancer, it's possible to observe a hypomethylation of other areas except for CpG islands, such as intergenic regions. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><pre></pre><pre><code><code></code></code></pre><div><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">A sensitive period is a moment during development in which the organism's epigenetic marks are reset. There are two major sensitive periods during mammals' development: the primordial germ cell development period and the "pre and early post-implantation"period. As we do inherit gene expression patterns from our parents, modifications, especially those occurring during gamete development, can be passed forward to the offspring.</span></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, that works as an inhibitor to DNA methyltransferase. That results in hypomethylation of hypermethylated regions, reverting gene silencing and allowing normal expression of  p15INK4B. When this happens, the cancer cell starts to express suppressor genes and to differentiate. Those activities combined result in tumor suppression.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprinted genes commonly express only one of the alleles. The Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) is imprinted in a way that only the paternal allele is expressed. The Loss of imprinting activates the gene that is normally inactivated, in this case, the maternal allele. When this happens, both of the genes are silenced.  The loss of imprinting in IGF2 is the most common factor behind Willms tumors, and it was in this kind of tumors that it was first observed. The activation of IGF2 seems to have a positive effect over tumor growth since it appears to reduce apoptosis.<br /></div>
