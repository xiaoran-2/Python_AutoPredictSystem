    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are normally, for the most part, hypomethylated in the promoters of genes that are expressed. In cancer, CpG islands are hypermethylated. Methylation of CpG island regions leads to gene silencing. This means that in cancer epigenetics, several tumor suppressor genes are silenced due to this abnormal methylation pattern in a way that is mitotically heritable and thus stably transmitted in cancer cell populations.<br /><br />In intergenic regions and repetitive elements on the other hand, normal cells appear to display higher levels of DNA methylation. Such silencing is meant to prevent illegitimate recombination between repeats, disruption of neighbor genes or activation and transposition of genes. In cancer cells, several of these repeats are hypomethylated, leading to loss of such genomic stability and more chances of chromosomal mutations. Intergenic regions or CpG poor promoters are usually methylated to silence genes that encourage tumor formation and proliferation. Hypomethylation of these regions in cancer cells leads to activation of oncogenes that could directly contribute to tumorigenesis.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The imprint control region (ICR1) for Igf2 and H19 genes on the paternal allele is methylated. This ensures that the gene cluster is paternally imprinted. H19 is silenced and the strong promoter of Igf2 from further upstream ensures that it is actively expressed from the paternal allele. In the maternal allele, ICR1 is unmethylated. This means the enhancers controlled by ICR1 are free to enhance expression of H19. In the maternal allele therefore, Igf2 is not expressed.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumor, both the paternal and the maternal alleles are unmethylated. Thus both alleles are expressed and there is overexpression of Igf2 but no expression of H19 from either. Since H19 acts as a tumor suppressor, its lack of expression leads to childhood tumor of the kidney characteristic of this disease.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decatibine is a DNA demethylating agent developed by Japanese company Eisei. This means that decatibine effectively removes methyl groups from sites on DNA. Since in several types of cancers, CpG island hypermethylation is a siginificant contributor to tumor suppressor gene silencing and cancer progression, decatibine helps to reactivate some of these aberrantly silenced genes and reduce tumorigenesis.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic modifications are mitotically heritable. DNA methylation modifications are transmitted to daughter cells by the enzyme DNA methyltransferases or DNMT, which methylates daughter DNA strands in the same positions over and over again. If we alter DNA methylation in a stable manner through therapy, such alteration would be passed down to all the cells arising from the treated cell, leading to enduring benefits for the epigenome. A sensitive period in epigenetics is a period of development in which the epigenome is undergoing erasure and reapplication of marks and/or imprints. In development, there are two main periods of sensitivity - the early embryonic stage around blastulation, and later in primordial germ cell development. Treating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable as the epigenome is particularly susceptible during this period. Any disturbance or intervention could lead to undesirable alterations in crucial portions of the epigenome, causing more damage than good.</div>
