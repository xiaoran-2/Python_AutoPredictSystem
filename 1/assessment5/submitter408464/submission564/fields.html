    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normally CpG islands are unmethylated so tumor suppression genes can be expressed. It is suspected that accumulation of epigenetic mistakes can lead to hypermethylation as a normal feature of aging. Tumor suppressor genes can be methylated leading to anomalous cells that have a longer lifespan and a more rapid division cycle. This characteristics lead to these cells replacing the normal ones, as well as an increased risk of mutations.<br />The intergenic and repetitive regions are normally methylated insuring genomic stability. In cancer, these regions are hypomethylated. Mouse models have been used to try to figure out the mechanism by which this happens. In those models, Dnmt1 was disrupted, leading to a passive demethylation. Un or hypomethylated, these regions have a higher chance of developing aberrant interactions between alleles, or chromosomes, through insertions, deletions or transpositions. These modifications are very likely to disrupt normal gene expression. <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Regarding the H19/Igf2 cluster, the paternal allele has the Imprint Control Region methylated, resulting in enhancer proteins binding to Igf2 gene and inducing expression. The maternal allele as the ICR unmethylated, so the CTCF protein can bind, causing the enhancer proteins to activate the H19 gene expression instead of Igf2. <br />The disruption of Imprinting in this cluster can lead to expression of inhibition of genes on both alleles. In cancer, there may be over expressing of pro growth genes or inhibition of growth restricting genes. <br />In Wilm's tumor the maternal ICR is hypermethylated resulting in expression of Igf2 and inhibition of H19. Together with the paternal allele, the Igf2 gene expression reaches two times the normal level in specific tissues, leading to affected cells having an increased growth rate. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent that can passively remove the methyl groups in DNA. It is noted in the article "Cancer's epicentre" published in The Economist, that it has an anti-tumor effect by reducing the rate of development of the size of the tumor, and/or by being able to sensitize the tumor cells to standard chemotherapy. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because any change that is made is mitotically heritable as well as the rest of the epigenome.<br />There are certain periods of development when it would be advised to not treat patients with such drugs. There are sensitive periods in a persons development during which the epigenome can be easily altered, as it is undergoing epigenetic reprogramming. These periods are during early development and during development of primordial germ cells. <br />A treatment with epigenetically altering agents can disrupt these sensitive periods by over or undermethylation of key regions, causing genomic instability or pre cancerous states. Changes incompatible with life might also occur.</div>
