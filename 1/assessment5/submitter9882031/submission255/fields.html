    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation occurs at the 5-carbon position of the nucleotide cytosine; this event typically takes place at CpG dinucleotide repeats (approx. 70-80% of all CpG islands) found in the nuclei of mammalian somatic cells, although there are rare instances where this occurs at non-CpG dinucleotides at ESCs. DNA methylation is crucial for key events in development, such as X-inactivation and genomic imprinting, as well as for converting euchromatic into heterochromatin; in general, DNA methylation at key promoter regions correlates with silenced gene expression. Conversely, CpG islands, or sites, are abundant in promoter regions of genes that are actively expressed and are therefore kept free from methylation in order for the cell to produce the necessary gene products required. However, in cancer these promoter regions are hypermethylated (i.e., region-specific methylation), hindering the transcriptional machinery from binding to these regions; critically, the gene body of these promoters might be upstream of tumour-suppresor genes which have roles in DNA repair, cell cyle and apoptosis. This aberration leads to cessation of these tumour suppressor proteins (CIMP phenotype), exacerbating the underlying cancer by, for example, leading to uncontrolled cell division (e.g., neoplasms); indeed, it has been shown that hypermethylation correlates well with tumourigenicity. In addition, there is global (or directed) loss of methylation at gene bodies, which is especially apparent in intergenic regions and repetitive elements, which are normally silenced in order to preserve genomic stability. When these transposon-like sequences are expressed, they can 'jump' into other genomic regions leading to genomic instability. This can, in turn, lead to cryptic promoter activation (e.g., oncogenes) and disruption of nearby genes (e.g., tumour-suppressing) further exacerbating the condition. In addition, oncogene activation might occur via hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters, transforming cells into tumour cells (for a detailed account, see Hassler &amp; Egger, 2012).</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Genomic imprinting is a crucial developmental event, leading to parent-of-origin monoallelic expression of a gene product. The H19/Igf2 cluster is a prominent example of this event. Typically, growth factor genes present variable motifs of methylation, as seen from the H19/Igf2. In particular, the paternal allele is hypermethylated at the Imprinting Control Region (ICR), an insulator-like region, thus allowing the cluster's enhancers to act on IGF2 only leading to its increased transcription (i.e., expression of growth promoting genes); conversely, on the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated, which now binds CTCF, a transcriptional repressor, allowing the enchancers to act on H19 (a lcRNA crucial in limiting body weight and cell proliferation), while IGF2 will be silenced. In Wilm's tumour (a childhood kidney cancer), the ICR on the maternal allele is hypermethylated as well, so that there father-like expression of this allele. This imprinting disruption can lead to a double dose of the IGF2 product, which is growth promoting and cell proliferating. In addition, the silenced H19 now does not inversely regulate cell proliferation, leading to neoplastic structures.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent/drug. This means that it works by inhibiting DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). In cancer, it has been observed that, apart from global hypomethylation of repetitive elements, regional hypermethylation of CpG dinucleotides in the gene bodies of tumour-suppresor genes correlates well with tumourigenicity; this methylation is laid down by DNMTs. Silenced tumour-suppresor genes cannot produce their respective products to halt uncontrolled cellular division, leading to neoplasms. Decitabine (as well as other hypomethylating drugs, such as azacitidine) can resolve this by inhibiting DNMTs; it does this by binding onto DNA strands and biochemically hindering the covalent attachment of methyl (CH3) groups onto the 5-carbon position of cytosine, so that DNA is expressed, including in tumour-suppresor genes, therefore exerting an anti-tumour effect.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation laid down by DNA methyltransferases can propagate epigenetic signal onto daughter strands via the maintenance DNA methyltransferase, DNMT1; this is referred to as mitotic heritability of epigenetic marks. This is especially apparent, for example, in development during X-inactivation when, during the one-cell stage in females, there is inactivation of the X chromosome. This cellular event, along with other epigenetic marks, is propagated to daughter cells through mitotic heritability. Accordingly, during the lifespan, any alterations in methylation patterns (e.g., via the environment) could be propagated to daughter cells through mitosis, having effects both genetically and epigenetically. This is especially crucial during sensitive periods (e.g., perinatally/early life), when there is enhanced sensitivity to epigenetic marks/epigenetic regulation; this is especially apparent in brain development (i.e., early-life plasticity) and gamete formation. Therefore, it would inadvisable to treat patients with methylating agents during sensitive periods when there is 'correct' setting of epigenetic marks, as this might lead to aberrations in the epigenome (e.g., side effects), apart from the therapeutic effect, which are subsequently inherited in daughter and granddaughter cells.</div>
