    <div class="field-value">Normally, DNA methylation at CpG islands is associated with silencing of the relevant gene as CpG islands are often located at the promotors of these genes and methylation is globally associated with silencing. However, in cancer, we see hypermethylation at locus specific sites (CpG islands) and hypomethylation genome-wide. Often the hypermethylation seen in cancer at CpG islands is found at those with promote tumour suppressing genes. Hence, when hypermethylated, these tumour suppressing genes are silenced and tumours are able to grow with more ease. At intergenic regions and repetitive elements, DNA methylation is needed to maintain genomic stability and integrity. This can be done by silencing long term repeats, etc. Genomic instability can include illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats, transpositions, insertions, deletions, etc. In cancer, these intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated, hence leading to such instability. CpG poor promoters can also be hypomethylated, leading to activation of some oncogenes, such as R-RAS in gastric cancer, and activation of certain microRNAs that target tumour suppressors. DNA methylation can have different roles depending on context, tumour type and/or stage.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Cancer cells often undergo loss of imprinting and hence do not undergo parent-of-origin specific expression as many of the genes imprinted are involved in some capacity with growth and hence contribute to the development of cancer. On the paternal allele, the imprint control region is methylated, and so CTCF does not bind, and the enhancers will act on Igf2, leading to expression. On the maternal allele, however, the ICR is typically unmethylated, so CTCF binds to the insulator element and the enhancers act on H19 rather than Igf2, which is hence not expressed. In Wilm's tumour, there is a loss of imprinting at the maternal allele, and hence there is hypermethylation of the ICR on the maternal allele, leading to CTCF not binding and the enhancers working on Igf2 to promote expression. There is hence twice as much expression of Igf2 than normal. Igf2 is involved in growth promotion, and hence this leads to Wilm's tumour as the cells continue to grow and divide out of control, leading to cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, used in myelodysplastic syndrome that has progressed to acute myeloid leukemia. It is a nucleoside analogue, and hence it is accepted into the DNA while it is undergoing replication and permanently binds DNMT when the latter attempts to bind too the nucleotide to copy the methylation to the daughter cell. Hence the DNA is hypomethylated. It is dependent on cell division, and is hence particularly effective on tumours, where the cells are rapidly dividing. By hypomethylating the DNA, the tumour suppressing genes regain normal function and hence are able to control the growth of the tumour.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic marks such as methylation are mitotically heritable by their very nature, and are hence passed down through the cell lineage as the cell divides and proliferates. The methylation of a particular DNA sequence may also affect that of neighbouring sequences (eg: CpG island shores.) A sensitive period is one that occurs in childhood, when the germ cells are still differentiating and the child is particularly susceptible to stimuli in the environment and formulating responses to the same. Sensitive periods occur in infancy and toddler years, when children pick up visual and lingual cues, amongst others, extremely quickly as they assimilate the information and learn at a rapid pace. Treating patients during such sensitive periods could result in permanent damage to the child's growth and development, especially due to the effects on developing germ cells as the disruption to the epigenetic machinery could prevent them from being able to sufficiently differentiate and hence develop in later life. These long lasting effects to the germ line could result in irreversible damage as the child matures.</div>
