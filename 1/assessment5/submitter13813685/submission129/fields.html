    <div class="field-value"><p>Many evidence suggested (S.Baylin2005, M.Hassler,G.Egger 2012),that DNA methylation refers to  the addition of a methyl group to to the base cytosine in the dinucleotide CpG. Regions of DNA in the human genome, that are CG rich are called CpG islands and are usually found in the promoters of genes. Roughly half of all gene promoters have CpG islands that when methylated lead to transcriptional silencing. DNA methylation is catalysed by the DNA methyltransferases, including those which establish methylation DNMT3a and DNMT3b  and maintain methylation by DNMT1. The epigenetic marking of the human genome by DNA methylation is heritable and stable (during cell division). According S.  Baylin (2005p.S5) methylation helps to maintain transcriptional silence in nonexpressed or noncoding regions of the genome. As He suggested heterochromatin is heavily methylated. By contrast, these sites are generally unmethylated in promoter regions of eucromatin, regardless of the transcriptional state of the gene .Also, M. Hassler and G. Egger (2012) suggested that DNA methylation is the basis for different epigenetic phenomena such as X chromosome inactivation and imprinting. </p><p>There is must to suggest that In cancer, genomic hypomethylation occurs mostly at DNA-repetitive regions which results in activation of genes with growth and tumour promoting functions and loss of genome stability and imprinting. However, promoter hypermethylation in areas of the genome with a high density of CpG also plays a major role in cancer through transcriptional silencing of tumor suppressor genes, can also be a feature of cancer cells. Other chromatin modifications, such as histonedeacetylation affect local chromatin structure and, in concern with DNA methylation, regulate gene transcription (S. Baylin, 2005,M.Hassler,G.Egger 2012).</p><p> </p><p>St. B Baylin DNA methilation and gene silencing in cancer, (2005)  Nature Clinical Practice Oncology,Review, 2, S4-S11.</p><p>M.Hassler &amp; G.

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.

    <div class="field-value">As is known ( Abramowitz LK, Bartolomei MS.2012) normally the IGF2 gene undergoes genomic imprinting and only  copy inherited from a  father is active. In some cancers, both the paternally inherited and the maternally inherited copies of the gene are active, increasing the amount of  IGF2  that cells can produce. They gave as example BWS which inherited from mother and Increased expression of paternally IGF2 is implicated in some cases . They <span>propose that</span> imprinting status of IGF2 (and H19) is controlled by the methylation of an imprinting control region (ICR), which localised between IGF2 and H19. On the paternal chromosome ICR is methylated, IGF2 is expressed and H19 expression is silenced because H19 promoter is methylated. However, on the maternally inherited chromosome ICR is unmethylated, IGF2 is silenced and H19 is expressed, H19 promoter is unmethylated.In some of BWS cases, maternal and paternal ICR are methylated and associated with expression of IGF2 and silencing of H19 on both chromosomes . This pattern would be predicted to double IGF2 expression and cause embryonal tumour susceptibility. Increase expression of IGF2 is a  charasteristic  of Wilms tumour.<br /> Abramowitz LK, Bartolomei MS.

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>As mention resent research by N.Azad and  et.all (2013)  Decitabine is   DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, and provides to hypomethylation of DNA. Decitabines antitumour effect evokes by reactivation of epigenetically silenced tumor supressor genes, by the hypothemylation. Baylin and his colleagues(2013 p5) used for treatment  low doses of the drugs and showed a benefit with patients a myelodysplatic syndrome, as lung cancer,  because they are toxic  high doses. They also suggested that low-dose therapy with this agent reversed cancer cell gene pathways, including cell repair,  cell differentiation, immune cell interaction, and cell death.Conventional chemotherapy work by indiscriminately and killing rapidly-dividing cells, including cancer cells, by damaging DNA. In contrast, low doses of AZA and DAC may re-activate genes that stop cancer growth without causing immediate cell death or DNA damage.</p><p> </p><p>N.

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>It is known (N.Azad et all.2012) that DNA methylation is reversible and best target in treatments because it can be manipulated and permanent effects are assure as the DNA methyl transfers enzymes conserve methyl marks during mitosis. The precise mechanism of how the drugs work is the focus of ongoing studies by Baylin and his team(2013). Baylin suggesting that the drugs shrink tumors more slowly over time as they repair altered mechanisms in cells and genes return to normal function and the cells may eventually die.They hypothesizes  that in using low-dose epigenetic-modulating agents, tumour cells can be reprogrammed.They suggest that such doze of drug and scheduling of currently accessible agents has succesful effect  in cancer management,when used alone or incombination with other  chemotherapies. However, these epigenetic drugs may influence on functioning processes especially during critical periods , when extensive epigenetic reprogramming occurs. It would be  dangerous  to use these drug for  treatments to pregnant mothers as a lot of reprogramming happens in early child development also during the formation of male/ female gametes( M. Blewitt,Courcera Lecture, ,epigenomic reprogramming, 2015)</p><p><br /></p><p>N. Azad, C. Zahnow, C. Rudin, S. Baylin (2013) The future of epigenetic therapy in solid tumours. Nat Rev Clin Oncol.10(5): 256–266.</p></div>
