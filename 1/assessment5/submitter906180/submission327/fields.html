    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation is important for imprinting, X chromosome inactivation and formation of heterochromatin. CpG islands
are kept free of methylation, since they are related to promoters regions. Repetitive
elements and intergenic regions tend to be methylated. However, in cancer cells
these promoters CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated and the repetitive elements
and intergenic regions are hypomethylated. The DNA hypermethylation in CpG
islands leads to tumour suppressor genes silencing in cancer. In order words, there is a "swap" of where the DNA methylation is found. According to the
Knudson hypothesis, cancer is a result of multiple hits to DNA. The silencing
of a tumour suppressor gene, can be one of the hits. As DNA methylation is
mitotically heritable, these epimutations can be selected, since the mutated cells are more likely to divide or to not die as much. As the cancer grows and time passes, there is a methylation increase of GpC islands that are associated with tumour suppressors. These epigenetic mistakes accumulate over the lifetime and can be associated with ageing. Along with those considerations, we know that DNA methylation is important to maintain genomic stability.When repetitive and intergenic intervals are hypomethylated, recombinations between repeats are more likely. Besides, transposition and activation of repeats, as well as activation of cryptic promoters, are also consequences of the genome-wide hypomethylation.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine, as well as azacitidine, act as a DNA-demethylating agent by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. Both are used for treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia. Since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, these agents are considered a type of epigenetic therapy. DNA methylation is basically the addition of a methyl group to DNA nucleotides. Methylation of tumour supressor genes contributes to the development of cancer. Hypomethylating agents are able to decrease the amount of DNA methylation in the target and improve the genome's stability.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic treatments that involve interference in DNA methylation are mitotically heritable, so they end up disappearing and not returning. That's why this kind of treatment can last beyond the period of treatment. In sensitive periods, like embryogenesis and development, many cells are dividing very fast and the drugs will be around those cells. Since in adults the cells that are dividing would be tumors cells, the drug would stay close to them, but during development the drug would be everywhere and could affect every cell. That's why pregnant women and children should't make use of these kind of drug. Once cells in development are affected, their epigenetic alterations may be passed on to daughter cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normally, only the maternal copy of H19 and the paternal copy of IGF2 are expressed, since both genes are imprinted. H19 is a noncoding RNA that suppress growth and IGF2 coden for a growth factor. The maternal H19 is an inhibitor of IGF2 transcription. Without the imprinting of both genes, there is a loss of H19 expression and overexpression of IGF2, leading to tumorigenesis. Wilms' tumour cells have loss of imprinting of the maternal chromossome and H19 is inactivated, resulting in the overexpression of IGF2. Since H19 works slowing cell growt and IGF2 stimulates cells growth, loss of imprinting results in uncontrolled cell growth that can lead to tumor growth. Loss of imprinting of the IGF2 gene is associated with many other types of cancer.</div>
