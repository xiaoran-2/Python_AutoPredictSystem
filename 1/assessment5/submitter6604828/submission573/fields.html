    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cells CpG islands are not methylated. Methylation happens on normal cells at intergenic spaces and repetitive elements. In cancer cells tumour suppressor genes have CpG islands hypermethylated therefore silencing these genes. Normal cells are genome-wide methylated and low methylated at CpG islands, this relation gradually changes as normal cells are transformed into hyperplastic cells, neoplasic cells and invasive malignant cells in which  the global methylation level has been decreased and Cpg islands methylation level has increased at maximum levels. For normal cells methylation sets a "reading order" being at intergenic zones and also at repetitive elements zones, when these regions loose methylation reading problems arise as what specialists may call "genomic instability", this is a way for cancer formation.<br /><br />Notes from the Epigenetics course.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cells the pattern of the paternal allele is methylated at the ICR and also at the H19 region and because of these the enhancers act directly at the Igf2 region allowing the gene to express. For the same normal cell the maternal allele has its ICR unmethylated but covered by CTCF and because of the enhancers preference on the H19 region they (the enhancers) do not have effect on the Igf2, so at the end of this normal cell just one of the alleles is actually activating Igf2. n the contrary, in affected cells the maternal allele is methylated at the ICR and also at the H19 zone because of this enhancers go directly to the  Igf2 showing with this the same behaviour of the paternal allele, this brings epigenetic problems and further consequences as Wilm´s Tumour. In general,  problems at ICR, either for hypomethylation or hypermethylation, they result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes.<br /><br /><br />Notes from the Epigenetics course.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a epigenetic inhibitor from the class of DNMTi (DNA methylation inhibitors), which means it reduces methylation in general (actually the lack of specificity is an issue with this drug), this helps to keep appropriate methyl levels so tumour suppressor genes may actually act avoiding tumours growth.<br /><br />Notes from the Epigenetics course<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic drugs have an enduring effect because epigenetic changes may be passed on through cell division. Something important to consider is their possible effect on germ cells of younger patients, this is the reason that states which periods must be considered as sensitive (to avoid side effects) such as pregnancy and childhood. The tratment through these sensitive periods may alter the epigenetic environment necessary for the healthy development.<br /><br /><br />Notes from the epigenetics course.<br /></div>
