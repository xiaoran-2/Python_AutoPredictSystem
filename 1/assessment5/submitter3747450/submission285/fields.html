    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are CG rich fragments which usually are not methylated, but when methylated they can promote such events as imprinting, X chromosome inactivation and silencing of the associated genes (Hassler and Egger, 2012; Hernández-Reyes, 2008). In cancer cells, CpG islands become hypermethylated, and as a result from this, silencing of associated genes will occur (García-Robles et al., 2012). When CpG islands are hypermethylated, tumour suppressor genes become silenced and as a consequence, neoplasia development is promoted (García-Robles, et al., 2012; Hassler and Egger, 2012).  CG dinucleotids in intragenic regions and repetitive elements (as well as introns) are usually methylated (Cavagnari, 2012), the function of DNA methylation is to maintain genomic instability. In cancer cells, both intergenic regions and repetitive elements (as well as introns) are hypomethylated, as a consequence of this, will occur activation of repeats and transposition, illegitimate recombination of repeats, and activation of cryptic promoters. As a consequence of hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements, genomic instability is lost, so transposable elements may become active (McCabe, et al, 2009)</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal conditions for imprinted genes, only one copy, the one maternally or the one paternally inherited is active. So, depending of the gene, one of the two copies is epigenetically silenced usually by DNA methylation. When improper imprinting occurs, the individual can have two active copies or two inactive copies of the imprinted gene, and in turn this can result in serious problems such as developmental abnormalities and cancer (http//learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/epigenetics/imprinting)<br />When the imprint control region of the paternal allele is methylated, CTCF can not bind, as a consequence there is no insulator action, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter, becomes methylated and silenced, then the enhancers are free to act on Igf2 promoting its expression from the paternal allele only.<br />When the imprint control region of the maternal allele is unmethylated, it is bound by the insulator protein CTCF, then CTCF insulate Igf2 from downstream enhancers which now are free to act on H19, so the expression of H19 is enhanced from the maternal allele only.<br />H19/Igf2 cluster disruption results in loss of imprinting derived from disruption of those DNA methylation imprints, and overexpression of growth promoting genes or loss of tumour suppress genes because loss of imprinting.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a drug sold by a Japanese company, it belongs to the epigenetic inhibitor class "DNA-demethylating agent". It is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. Anti-tumour effects of Decitabine came from its incorporation into DNA and inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, resulting in hypomethylation of DNA and intra-S-phase of DNA replication.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic changes can be inherited from mother cells to daughter cells and to granddaughter cells through cell division, until these epigenetic marks are erased. There are periods of development in which sensitivity to changes is enhanced. So, a sensitive period is that in which active remodelling of epigenetic marks is going on. Early life represents a period characterized by high sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms (Nagy and Turecki, 2012). There is a number of sensitive periods in which epigenetic influence is enhanced. One of these is during cell differentiation, because this is when cell lineages are forming, zygote formation is another one, as well as during embryo development, and during egg and sperm cells development.<br />Experiences during sensitive periods of development influence DNA methylation patterns of several genes (Roth and Sweatt, 2011). Michael Meaney research group demonstrated that maternal behavior in rats during early postnatal development directly modifies chromatine (Weaver et al, 2004), they found that patterns of DNA methylation of the GR gene resulted from mother´s caregiving behaviors.<br />Treating patients with drugs that modify DNA methylation could be risky in certain highly sensitive periods such as embryonic development or germ cell formation.</div>
