    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p><span>In cancer
genome-wide DNA methylation decreases while DNA methylation at CpG islands
increases. In normal cells CpG islands are unmethylated, so genes, which promoters
contain CpG islands, are active. In cancer's cells hypermethylation of CpG
islands is observed. Number of hypermethylated CpG islands increases in time,
during the progress of disease. Hypermethylation of CpG islands leads to
repressing of genes with CpG enriched promoters. In such way tumor suppressing
genes become less active, which results in cancer progress and poor prognosis in some cases.<br />
Intergenic regions and repetitive elements in normal cells are methylated. It
causes silencing of these parts of genome and maintains genome stability.
Density of methylation in these regions decreases in time during cancer. This
process is observed in genome-wide hypomethylation. Hypomethylation in
intergenic regions and repetitive elements causes loss of genome stability and
results in higher frequency of illegitimate recombinations, such as deletions,
translocations and insertions. The illegitimate recombinations alternate gene
expression and integrity. Enhance of oncogene expression and disturbance of
tumor suppressors cause progress of cancer.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Disruption
of DNA methylation at imprinting control regions causes changes in expression  of genes which play role in growth of cells.
H19/Igf2 cluster is one of the most studied examples of imprinting. In the
paternal allele this cluster contains active Igf2 gene and inactive H19. It is
caused by methylation of ICR, which prevents CTCF binding and opens access to
Igf2 for enhancers, and by methylation of H19 promoter. In the maternal allele
this regions are unmethylated, so H19 gene is active, CTCF binds with ICR and
blocks activation of Igf2 expression by enhancers. In Wilm's tumour we observe
hypermethylation of this cluster, so ICR and H19 promoter in the maternal
allele are methylated likely in the paternal allele, so in this case Igf2 is
also expressed in the maternal allele and H19 is silenced. As the result in the
cell there are double expressing of Igf2 and complete silencing of H19. Changes
in expression of H19/Igf2 cluster genes play significant role in tumour growth,
even in early stages.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine
is a DNA-demethylating agent. So, decitabine inhibits DNA methyltransferases
and reduces DNA hypermethylation in cancer. Decreasing of DNA methylation
density in CpG islands and imprinted genes leads to re-activating of
tumour-suppressor's genes and  restriction
of growth genes expression. As the result disease stops progressing, such
therapy can stop tumour's growth.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Epigenetic
changes such as DNA methylation are mitotically hereditable, so they passed on
during cell division and established in newly synthesized DNA. There are 2 periods
in development, when epigenetic marks are erased and established <i>de novo - </i>early
embryonic development before gastrulation and development of germ line cells.
These periods are called sensitive. Any disruptions in DNA methylation in these
periods caused by treatment or other factors can be resulted in inappropriate
DNA methylation, which will be inherited by daughter cells. Consequences of
altering in DNA methylation can lead to diseases caused by altering in genes
expression or genome instability as the result of incorrect epigenetic state.
That's why therapy with influence on methyletion processes is would be
inadvisable for pregnant women in sensitive periods of embryo’s development.
