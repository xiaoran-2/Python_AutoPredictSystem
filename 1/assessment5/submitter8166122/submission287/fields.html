    <h1>Submission 287 from Anon (session_user_id: f3a5dbac799f5f0d27844e0c01fd19379d306606)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the group of antimetabolites, particularly a DNMT1 inhibitor. It acts as a nucleoside analog (cytidine analog) which gets incorporated to the DNA/RNA in the replication; the DNMT1 recognizes its substrate but binds irreversibly to it and therefore depletes the enzyme sources in the cell at some point. It's been used in the treatment of hematological malignancies, such as myelodisplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia. Hypermethylation features results in aberrant silencing of tumor supressor genes, and inducing hypomethylation of nucleic acids in cancer cells has proven to be clinically effective and another target worthy of research. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is a very stable epigenetic process and one of the most studied. The modification of cytosine to 5-methyl cytosine in CpG dinucleotides is a common feature in somatic cells and in some cases in embryonic cells. The opposite occurs in CpG islands, regions sitting at the promoter with a high density of CpGs but often unmethylated, thus allowing the active transcription. DNA hypermethylation of CpG islands is very frequent in cancer cells, appearing in almost all types of malignancies studied, and represents an advantage in diagnosis and prognosis since it can be correlated with the stage or the type of tumor in some cases. This hypermethylation can silence key regulatory genes such as tumor supressors, involved in controlling cell division in normal tissue, inducing apoptosis, and DNA repairing, therefore contributing to the development of cancer. Another feature of DNA methylation in cancer is the silencing of intergenic regions and repetitive elements. Since early development these regions are silenced and they're not allowed to replicate autonomously, a characteristic of transposable elements. In cancer, if these regions are not properly methylated they can expose cryptic promoters and cause a wide variety of chromosomic alterations (indels, translocations), all these contributing to genomic instability. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the case of the<i> H19/Igf2 </i>cluster, the alteration comes from a <b>hyper</b>methylation of the ICR of the maternal allele. This cluster is a set of genes involved in growth regulation. Normally, in the <b>maternal</b> alelle,<i> </i>the lncRNA from the gene <i><b>H19</b></i><b> is expressed</b> but <i><b>Igf2</b></i><b> is not</b>. The ICR in the maternal alelle is unmethylated, and allows the insulator CTCF to bind to the ICR. This binding blocks the enhancers to access distally the <i>Igf2</i> gene, therefore it is not expressed in the maternal allele. In the <b>paternal</b> alelle occurs the opposite: the ICR is methylated in this case, and methylation reaches upstream the <i><b>H19</b></i><b> gene, silencing</b> its expression and the lncRNA product. On the other hand, the enhancers can access the <i><b>Igf2</b></i> gene and it can be <b>expressed</b>. In Wilms tumor, the hypermethylation of the maternal allele causes an overexpression of <i>Igf2 </i>in a paternall-like form<i>.</i> <em>Igf2</em> is a growth factor involved in early development, so this overexpression, coupled with the reduced expression of <i>H19</i> (which is a negative regulator of cell proliferation) contributes to the development of this type of cancer. <i></i></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The sensitive periods are specific phases during development in which the genome is more <b>susceptible</b> to changes of the epigenomic state, that is in the establishment of epigenetic marks. The two major periods are <b>early embryonic development</b> and <b>primordial germ cell and germ cell development</b>. <br />DNA methylation is very stable, and one of the most important features of methylation is that it can be passed to subsequent generations of cells, like keeping a certain "memory"; this mantainance of the methylation pattern can then be altered. A treatment targeting DNA methylation could have effects altering the epigenetic state, specifically during <strong>periconceptional period and early embryonic development</strong>, which would affect the normal reprogramming of epigenetic marks. </div>
