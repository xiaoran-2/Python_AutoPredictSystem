    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value">Many CpG islands are found within or near the promoters of genes. Methylation of CpG islands normally functions in the regulation the genes corresponding to those promoters. In cancer, however, disruption of the normal methylation patterns in CpG islands leads to the abnormal expression or repression of critical genes. In many cases, a lack of methylation of oncogenes and a surplus of methylation at tumor suppressor genes work in tandem to induce cancer. Methylation in non-coding regions of the genome such as intergenic regions and repetitive elements serve to repress needless transcription and to prevent the spread of transposable elements, which are harmful to cells. Normal methylation patterns in these regions may also be disrupted in cancer, leading to uncontrolled transcription and transposon activity.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The disruption of imprinting can lead to abnormal expression of normally controlled genes, which is a hallmark of cancer. In the H19/Igf2 cluster, the maternal allele is unmethylated and the paternal allele is methylated. On the maternal allele, the insulator is able to bind to the imprint control region and prevent the expression of Igf2, a growth promoting gene and oncogene. On the paternal allele, because the imprint control region is methylated, the insulator is unable to bind, and thus Igf2 is expressed. In the condition called Wilm's tumor, a loss of imprinting leads to the overexpression of Igf2. Overexpression of Igf2 predisposes a patient to developing tumors in childhood and thus cancer because the cells are growing rapidly and uncontrollably.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a demethylation agent. It has the effect of reversing hypermethylation at the promoters of tumor suppressor genes, which are normally suppressed via hypermethylaton in cancer. By removing methylation from tumor suppressor genes, the tumor suppressor genes become more active, and thus the body's ability to fight the cancer improves.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because DNA methylation is inheritable mitotically. Thus, even after treatment with epigenetic drugs has ceased, the epigenetic changes caused by the drugs will carry on to daughter cells of the treated cells. However, altering DNA methylation at sensitive periods, such as the reprogramming of epigenetic marks during germ cell development and early embryonic development, can cause serious diseases in offspring and have devastating effects on fetal development. For this reason, treating patients with epigenetic drugs if they anticipate having children in the near future or are pregnant would not be advisable.<br /></div>
