    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are clusters of nucleotides that act as promoters for gene expression. Addition of methyl groups renders the CpG island as inactive and hence the expression of the gene (subsequent transcription and translation) does not occur. DNA Methylation induces silencing.
There are certain genes which act as checkpoints for transcription. These are called tumor suppressors. They are usually associated with other genes that promote growth and development. In the normal state, expression of these genes block continuous growth and / or cell division. The CpG islands on the promoters of the tumor suppressors are normally unmethylated. 
In cancer, there is methylation on the CpG islands associated with tumor suppressors. Hence, the checkpoint for DNA transcription is inactive allowing for unrestrained growth and cell division to proceed. This behavior helps explain the malignant hallmark of evading growth suppression.  
Intergenic elements and repeats in contrast to the tumor suppressors are usually methylated. Intergenic regions if unrestricted will allow for expression of multiple genes, creating aberrant copies and combinations. CpGs on the repeats also need to be silenced in the normal cell. As there are only 4 nitrogen bases in the genetic code, it is easy to imagine that a long repeat can facilitate erroneous pairing of non-partner chromosomal regions, which will facilitate in turn translocations and translations of abnormal proteins.  
In cancer, the CpG islands associated with the intergenic regions and the repeats lose methylation and hence will promote dysregulated transcription. This behavior helps explain the malignant hallmark of genomic instability.

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation in cancer can also be seen in imprint control regions (ICR) . The H19/IGF2 cluster is a differentially methylated cluster with the paternal and maternal allele promoting the expression of either H19 or IGF2. 
The paternal ICR is normally methylated silencing expression of H19 as the enhancers favor the expression of IGF2. The maternal ICR is normally unmethylated, and this ICR interacts with CTCF which favor the activity of enhancers on the expression of H19. 
In cancer, both maternal and paternal allele have methylated ICRs. This state will thus allow double expression of the IGF2 gene. 
IGF is associated with growth and development and hence can promote the development of tumors such as Wilm’s tumor.  This behavior helps explain the malignant hallmark of sustained proliferative signaling. https://class.coursera.org/epigenetics-003/lecture

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is an analogue of cytidine. It incorporates into DNA and its behavior varies by concentration / drug exposure. At high doses it behaves as a cytotoxic agent like similar antimetabolite chemotherapeutic agents. At lower doses it produces hypomethylation.  Our interest is on the low-dose hypomethylation effects. The drug is classified as a hypomethylation agent. 
When it encounters DNMT1, then the enzyme is inactivated leading indirectly to hypomethylation. The hypomethylation on promoters of tumor suppressor genes will therefore become active and would exert its anti-proliferative effect leading to cancer control.

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Changes made in the epigenetics are mitotically heritable. So even if the initial drug is discontinued, recently activated genes will persist being active in daughter cells. These alterations now become targets for subsequent therapy. 
Chemotherapy targets components of cell division to create changes that will push the cells into apoptosis/ cell death. Cancer cells that have  re-activated tumor suppressors will have more stringent growth and cell division regulation. Hence combination with chemotherapy favors cell death.  
Treatment with drugs involves potential for unintended effects The effect would have the highest risk over certain periods in the lifespan of the patient. These sensitive periods are the critical times where the drug produces the most detrimental effects.
These periods include the clearing and re-establishment of DNA methylation during  gametogenesis and early embryonic development. Animal data reports absence of DNMT activity is incompaltible with life. A drug that mimics the effect of DNMT knockout mice may have similar outcomes. 
Young children who are still actively growing may also be a sensitive period. They will be at risk that their growth/height  and development of secondary sexual characteristics will be impaired.
