    <h1>Submission 326 from Anon (session_user_id: 8d6334c2448181debf93e3d35ba5aead4b77eb8b)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine inhibits the methylation of DNA. It does this by stopping the action of  DNA methyltransferase, which is an enzyme which during replication of a chromosome recognises that only one strand of the DNA is methylated and adds methyl groups at coresponding places the other strand. With the DNA methylated it can wrap more around histones and also move to the periphery of the cell. In this way it becomes less active and this could lead to  a tumour surpressor gene not being expressed. With Decitabine treatment there is less methylation of some tumour supressors which have been silenced and so when they are  brought into operation they can limit tumour cell division. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome essentially because of processes that act during mitosis. First the pair of dna strands in a chromosome are replicated by the DNA polymerase enzyme. But then before they are seperated, the enzyme DNMT1 travels along the strands reading the presence of methylation on the parent strand and inserting methyl groups at corresponding places on the new strand. In this way the methylation pattern is preserved in both cells after division. <br /><br />A Sensitive Period occurs when cells are undergoing division, particulary when patterns of meylation are changing. The most sensitive periods are generally in early life, but also of course in a growng cancer tumour and that is what chemotherarpy targets.<br /><br />The Sensitive Periods during prgnancy are: firstly during the preimplantation phase when the paternal X is silenced, then at the gastrula stage when random X inaxtivation takes place and finally in mid gestation when the primordial germ cells are formed. After birth the brain is still very "plastic" so this is also a sentive period.<br /><br />Treating patients during sensitive periods of pregnancy and when young would be inadvisable because of the risk in tissues other than those being treated.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the paternal allele the CPG island which acts as a promoter for the H19 gene is normally methylated. This prevents the CTCF  binding to this H19 promoter and thus the enhancers for the gene do not loop correctly and provide a site for the RNA polymerase to start the transcription of the H19 gene. So H19 is silenced. Instead the adjacent Igf2 gene is expressed.<br /><br />In the maternal allele the CpG island is normally unmethylated so in this case CTFC can bind and H19 is expressed rather than the adjacent Igf2 gene.<br /><br />The normal condition would be one dose of Igf2 from the father and one dose of H19 from the mother, which is the correct level of doses for healthy cells.<br /><br />If the imprinting of the maternal allele is disturbed so that it also becomes methylated, then there is a double dose of Igf2 and none of H19. Since Igf2 is growth promoting, the double dose can lead to cancer - Wilm's tumour.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><br />The CpG islands act as a promoter location for a gene. If the CpG island is methylated then the gene's enhancers can't form a loop in the DNA to bring the enhancers close to the promoter. This then fails to provide a site for the RNA polymerase to bind to, and from which it would normally commence the transcription of the gene to form m-RNA. In this way it switches off or silences the gene. This would contribute to the development of a cancer if the gene has a tumour suppression function, because it would stop the cell producing one of the translated proteins which control the rate of cell division and multiplication, and thus leading to a line of cells which proliferate more than normal - a cancer.<br /><br />Other regions of the genome which are sensitive to methylation are the regions between introns, the inter gene regions, and the repititive elements. Normally these would be strongly methylated, and thus form part of the heterochromosome where they would play no part in the normal expression of genes. When they are un-methylated there is the possibility that unwanted RNAs could be transcribed. Also when these areas are un-methylated there is a risk that chromosome replication during mitotis  (and more especially during meiosis) may be abnormal resulting polyploidy and other chromsome changes. So maintenance of the methylation here prevents these changes. What happens in cancer is that the methylation of the intergenic regions and repititive elements is reduced leading to abnormal cells and forming a tumour.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
