    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">The normal function of DNA methylation at intergenic regions is to keep abnormal sequences in check. CpG islands promote function. DNA methylation suppresses or silences function. For that reason you don't expect DNA methylation at CpG islands. When DNA methylation IS at CpG islands there's a biologically sound reason. It's there to protect us from harm. When normal DNA methylation is disrupted in promoter regions at CpG islands then tumor suppressor genes cease to be silenced and abnormal repetitive element sequences can lead to many things such as faulty DNA damage repair, abnormal cell proliferation, gain of function or loss of function inappropriately. All of those disruptions lead to cancer by contributing to a cascade of effects. Tumor suppressors are turned on, repressors are turned off. DNA repair mechanisms when shut down no longer regulate processes that prevent cancerous cell proliferation.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">If the imprint control region is paternally methylated enhancers can act on Igf2's expression to promote growth. The maternal allele expression/function is to restrict growth because it's a cycle independent kinase inhibitor-often called a tumor suppressor. When paternal and maternal alleles are both present and functional, growth is in check. When 2 alleles promote growth and no alleles restrict growth that can lead to cancer. That is what happens when there is a case of paternal uniparental disomy such as in Wilm's tumor of the kidney. It's due to a loss of imprinting and an over expression of growth promoting genes or loss of a tumor suppressing gene. Mutations or deletions in imprinting regions can cause loss of imprinting or uniparental disomy leading to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the class of epigenetic inhibitors called DNA demethylating agents. It slowed tumor growth. It altered cells to make them more susceptible to standard chemotherapeutic agents. It may be erasing epigenetic changes of a malignant nature to prevent transmission to daughter cells. This would break the cancer cycle by disrupting cells at the tumor formation phase rather than relying upon killing every cancer cell itself.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation patterns can be affected by many different types of environmental conditions. Some conditions shown to have an effect on the epigenome are nutrition, pollution, and stress in addition to personal consumption habits such as tobacco and alcohol use. Altering DNA methylation can cause future generations to be fatter, skinnier or more/less prone to asthma. Epigenetics is the altering of expression. Lifestyle can alter methylation patterns and that can affect future generations. A negative lifestyle choice may not eliminate offspring but could affect the size/shape/function/ and phenotype OF that offspring. A sensitive period of development is one in which exposure to positive or negative elements in the environment can have substantial and lasting effects on the epigenome. Sensitive periods of development include early embryonic development, and the first 100 days of life. Treating patients during a sensitive period could lead to unexpected negative outcomes. </div>
