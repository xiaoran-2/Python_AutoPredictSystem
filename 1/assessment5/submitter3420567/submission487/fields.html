    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell CpG islands are hypomethylated. But in cancer CpG islands became hypermethylated. DNA methylation in cancer occures in the promotor regions of tumor suppressor genes thus silencing them and allowing tumor to grow. <br />On the contrary entire genome (meaning intergenic regions and repetitive elements) is hypermethylated in a normal cell. This silencing of repetitive elements ensures genomic stability in a normally functioning cell. In cancer these genomic regions are demethylated becoming hypomethylated. This results in repeats becoming 'active' leading to genomic instabilities such as illegitimate recombinations between repeats, transpositions and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to
neighbouring genes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In general in cancer alterations in DNA methylation in Imprinting Control Regions (ICR) can lead to either overexpression of groth promoting genes or loss of expression of groth suppressor genes.<br />In the case of H19/Igf2 cluster hypermethylation of ICR leads to Igf2 overexpression which results in Wilm’s tumour.<br />So in a normal cell maternal allele is hypomethylated and it allowes CTCF binding. CTCF insulates Igf2 from downstream
enhancers thus suppressing Igf2 expression from maternal allele. Paternal allele is methylated, CTCF is not binding allowing expression of Igf2 from paternal allele.<br />In Wilm's tumour maternal allele becomes hypermethylated. This leads to Igf2 expression from both maternal and paternal allele resulting in Igf2 overexpression.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Decitabine acts like DNA Methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi). It irreversably binds DNMT after it incorporates into DNA. <br />This means that this process is replication dependent and thus more likely to affect cancer cells that are proliferating rapidly comparing to other tissues.<br />The mechanism of action is still not clear but most likely it reduces methylation (ie leads to hypomethylation like in a normal non-cancer cell) of </span>tumour suppressor gene promotors and thus their expression.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have <span>effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment because DNA methylation is mitoticly heritable or rather some of them modify proteins that participate in changing epigenetic state (enzymes or histones).<br />There are at least two major periods that are considered to be sensitive periods. Epigenetic reprogramming during </span>early development (can affect individual) and during primordial germ cell
development (can affect individual progeny). During sensitive periods epigenetic marks are first removed and then reset. And in those periods any disturbance of epigenetic machinery can lead to unpredictible side effects because these are the periods of its active functioning. So that also means that drugs affecting epigenetic machinery should be thouroughly tested before applying to youger patients whose germ cells are still developing.</div>
