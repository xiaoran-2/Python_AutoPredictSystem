    <div class="field-value">Methylation is one of the key epigenetic marks involved in controlling gene expression. Genes can be silenced by methylating CpG islands in the promoters of genes. Methylation of CpG islands increases in cancerous tissues (hypermethylation). Additionally, the region around a CpG island -the shore- may be hypermethylated as well. Different cancers are associated with the methylation of different genes. For example, methylation of BRCA1 is associated with breast cancer. By methylating the CpG islands of tumor-suppressing genes, cells lose the genes' protective functions against cancer. The methylation of CpG island shores can also silence important protective genes. DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements keep those parts of the genome from being expressed, which creates more genomic stability. For example, repetitive elements are found multiple times in multiple locations. If during replication a repetitive element paired up with the same sequence at a different locus, there would be illegitimate recombination, potentially disrupting gene function and the ability for homologous chromosome to pair. Silencing intergenic DNA is important because it may contain cryptic promoters or splice sites that if expressed could interfere with gene expression or splice the chromosome. The genome-wide instability associated with hypomethylation of these regions is found in many types of cancer and at various stages of cancer. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2) gene is is found near an imprint control region (ICR). On the maternally-derived allele, CTCF binds to the unmethylated ICR, which causes downstream enhancers to promote expression of H19 over Igf2. On the paternally-derived allele, CTCF can't bind the ICR as the region is methylated. H19's promoter is also methylated. The downstream enhancers instead promote Igf2 expression. In Wilm's tumor cells, the maternal allele is methylated like the paternal one: the CTCF binding region and the start of H19 are methylated on both homologous chromosomes. As Igf2 is a growth factor, cells with a double dose can out-grow and out-compete neighbouring cells, leading to tumorigenesis. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent / DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. It cause hypomethylation. The drug mimics a nucleoside, and gets incorporated into DNA during replication. When Dnmt1 tries to methylate decitabine, decitabine irreversibly binds to Dnmt1 so no further DNA methylation can happen. Consequently, decitabine can prevent the aberrant remethylation of tumor-suppressing genes, sliding the tumor cells back into more normal cell growth. </span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable: daughter cells will have the same methylation patterns as the original cell. After DNA replication, the strand of DNA from the parent cell (the template strand) will still be methylated, while the newly synthesized strand will not. The methyltransferase Dnmt1 recognizes these areas of DNA that are hemi-methylated, and methylates the unmethylated strand. Epigenetically sensitive periods occur when the epigenome is remodeled, which are during early embryonic development (the blastocyst stage) and primordial germ cell development. Treating someone during a sensitive period, or someone who is pregnant with a child at a sensitive period, could possibly have drastic effects, possibly even fatal. The epigenome is what distinguishes differentiated but genetically-identical cells, and it is vital for a cell to have the correct epigenetic marks for its function. </div>
