    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation may affect the transcription of genes in two ways. First, the methylation of DNA itself may physically impede the binding of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor">transcriptional proteins</a> to the gene,and second, and likely more important, methylated DNA may be bound by proteins known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methyl-CpG-binding_domain">methyl-CpG-binding domain</a> proteins (MBDs). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methyl-CpG-binding_domain_protein_2">MBD</a> proteins then recruit additional proteins to the locus, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone_deacetylase">histone deacetylases</a> and other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatin_remodeling">chromatin remodeling</a> proteins that can modify <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone">histones</a>, thereby forming compact, inactive chromatin, termed<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterochromatin">heterochromatin</a>. This link between DNA methylation and chromatin structure is very important.

DNA methylation is essential during embryonic development, and in somatic cells, patterns of DNA methylation are generally transmitted to daughter cells with a high fidelity. Aberrant DNA methylation patterns – hypermethylation and hypomethylation compared to normal tissue – have been associated with a large number of human malignancies. Hypermethylation typically occurs at CpG islands in the promoter region and is associated with gene inactivation. A lower level of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukocyte">leukocyte</a><span> DNA methylation is associated with many types of cancer.</span>Global hypomethylation has also been implicated in the development and progression of cancer through different mechanisms.<span>Typically, there is hypermethylation of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_suppressor_gene" title="Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_suppressor_gene">tumor suppressor genes</a><span> and hypomethylation of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncogene">oncoge</a>.</p><p>One role for intragenic methylation may be in regulating cell context-specific alternative promoters in gene bodies <span>and perhaps also prevent aberrant expression from intragenic promoters.

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>

    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.

        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
