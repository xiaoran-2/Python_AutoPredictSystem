    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>The
CpG islands are found at the gene promoter regions and they are rich in CG
dinucleotides. The methylation of cytosine leads to formation of
5-methylcytosine and this process is carried out by DNA methyltransferases
while the methylation pattern is retained through mitotic division. The status
of methylation defines gene expression levels. When CpG islands are methylated
gene expression is suppressed whereas expression is allowed when these sites
remain unmethylated.</li><li>Typically in most genes
     CpG islands remain unmethylated. In cancer, hypermethylation on CpG
     promoters leads to silencing of tumor suppressor genes. These epimutations
     ensure rapid proliferation and therefore they are selected and maintained
     through mitosis. CpG island shores cover the region of 2 kb
     surrounding the gene promoters. Commonly, they are hypermethylated for a
     wide set of genes for cancer allowing cancer subtyping and prognosis. In
     CpG poor promoters, we have observed hypomethylation and activation of
     oncogenes.</li><li>Intergenic
regions are DNA sequences between genes. In most cases their function is
unknown but there is proof that they may contain promoters and enhancers that
regulate expression of close or distal genes as well as they may produce non
coding RNAs like siRNAs and piRNAs. Repetitive elements, mainly originating
from viral transposons, can be found in these regions. Another class of
repetitive DNA is the one located in centromeres and telomeres ensuring proper
chromosome separation and genome stability. In normal cells, intergenic regions
and repetitive elements are methylated.</li><li><span>In
cancer cells, we observe hypomethylation of intergenic repeats resulting in
genomic instability. This is because transposition may be activated and illegitimate
recombination may occur, leading to gene silencing or usage of cryptic
promoters/splice sites to transcribe aberrant products. Therefore, tumor
suppressors may be inactivated and oncogenes may be activated due to deletions,
insertions or translocations.</span></li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>The H19/Igf2 locus is
     paternally imprinted. In the paternal allele, the Imprint Control Region
     (ICR) is methylated and methylation spreads to the downstream promoter of
     H19 gene, silencing its expression. Due to ICR methylation, the CTCF
     insulator protein cannot bind and the upstream Igf2 gene is transcribed
     under the control of the enhancers downstream of H19. In the maternal
     allele, the ICR remains unmethylated so CTCF binds and insulates Igf2 from
     the enhancers, suppressing its expression. On the contrary, the promoter
     of H19 gene remains unmethylated and it is transcribed under the control
     of the downstream enhancers.</li><li>In Wilm’s tumor,
     hypermethylation of the ICR of the H19/Igf2 locus results in CTCF not
     being able to bind to the ICR of the maternal allele and as a consequence
     Igf2 is expressed from both alleles (overexpressed) and H19 expression is suppressed.
     This is a common early event in pro-neoplastic tissue and this leads to
     cancer because Igf2 acts as a growth factor and a mitogen while H19 gives
     rise to a long ncRNA with growth restricting properties.

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an epigenetic drug and more specifically
it belongs to DNMT inhibitors (DNMTi). It is a nucleoside analog that binds to
the DNA methyltrasferase and inhibits its action after it is incorporated in
the DNA (replication dependent). Its action is unclear and sometimes
non-specific. However, it causes hypomethylation of the DNA which is
anti-tumoral in myelodysplastic syndromes because these syndromes are highly
dependent on tumor suppressor gene inactivation through hypermethylation. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark and therefore
mitotically heritable. DNMT3a and 3b are responsible for de novo methylation
and DNMT1 recognises hemimethylated DNA and methylates the newly replicated
strand to maintain the pattern. As a result, altering DNA methylation in
replicating cells leads to perpetuation of this modification to its daughter
cells even beyond the period of drug treatment.</p>

<p>It is inadvisable to treat patients with DNMT
inhibitors that alter DNA methylation during sensitive periods. The sensitive
periods are characterized by removal and or re-establishment of epigenetic
marks. These refer to epigenetic reprogramming during the preimplantation
period (from fertilization up to the blastocyst) and the primordial germ cell
development (occurring in the embryo during pregnancy). Treating pregnant women
or treating women in the pre-conceptional period could influence the normal
epigenetic modifications in the embryo and have lasting effects in the
offsprings e.g aberrant genomic imprinting or X-inactivation as well as
abnormal gametes differentiation possibly causing infertility or abnormalities
to the grandchildren. </p></div>
