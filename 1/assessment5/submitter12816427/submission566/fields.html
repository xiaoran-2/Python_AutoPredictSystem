    <h1>Submission 566 from Anon (session_user_id: ccfa7a80fa5e9f9f96f754622c79317fe964e8ac)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating drug  which is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. Decitabine treatment results in a decline of histone overmethylation dramatically. Over methylation <span>silences the  tumour-suppressor genes whose job is to stop the uncontrolled cell growth that causes cancer.</span> Treatment of dectabine  which is a demethylating drug results in removal of methylation marks on the tumor suppressor genes. These gene products reduces the proliferation of tumour cells while, importantly, having no apparent effect on nearby normal cells.<div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Methylation at CpG island in the promoter region of a gene results in the repression of the gene. In normal cells, CpG island in the promoter of a tumor suppressor gene is not methylated and the gene is expressed. However, the promoter of these genes are hypermethylated in cancer leading to repression of tumor suppressor genes.This disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands is mitotically inherited by the daughter cells. Cells with these epimutations are selected for as they divide rapidly and they have better survival compared to the neighboring (normal) cells which eventually leads to cancer. DNA methylation at the intragenic regions and the repetitive elements are important to maintain genomic integrity. It is evident that, cells lacking Dnmt1 display genomic instability and methylation of repetitive elements are important to prevent undesirable transposition, illegitimate recombination and transcriptional interference from strong promoters. In cancer, hypomethylation at intergenic regions/ repeats results in genomic instability. Disruption in demethylation of   repetitive elements  results in undesirable recombination, transposition and transcriptional interfernce. Disruption in demethylation of intergenic regions results in abnormal karyotype caused due to deletions, resiprocal translocation and insertions. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normally, the imprint control region of the Igf2/H19 cluster is methylated on the paternal allele, this results in the enhancers acting on Igf2 and Igf2 is expressed from the paternal allele. In the maternal allele the imprint control region of the Igf2/H19 cluster in unmethylated. This leads to the binding of CTCF to the control region resulting the enhancers acting on H19 and expression of H19 from the maternal allele.  In Wilm's tumor, there is hypermethylation of the imprint control region on the maternal allele leading to the expression of Igf2. Igf2 expression from the maternal allele results in a double dose of Igf2 (both from the paternal and maternal). As Igf2 is promotes growth, excessive expression of this gene results in the development of Wilm's tumor. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering of DNA methylation can  be inherited and as these changes are passed on during cell division to daughter cells DNA methylation can have an enduring effect on the epigenome. It is known that there are periods during postnatal development  the developing brain has heightened sensitivity to environmental factors. These sensitive periods are critical for brain plasticity, as the early environment will shape neural circuits and thus determine structural and functional aspects of brain and behavior for the lifespan. There are several evidences suggesting that
epigenetic factors play a critical role regulating
molecular mechanisms underlying brain plasticity
during these sensitive periods. Use of epigenetic drugs would alter the normal epigenetic marks during development of brain during the sensitive period and would disrupt the devlopment of brain plasticity. Hence, use of epigenetic  drugs should be avoided during sensitive periods.<br /></p><p><br /></p></div>
