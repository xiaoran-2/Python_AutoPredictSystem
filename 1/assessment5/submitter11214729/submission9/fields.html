    <div class="field-value">Many genes in mammalian genomes are regulated by CpG islands which are located within the promoter. When Cytosins of CpG dinucleotides  are methylated coresponding   gene is silenced and in contrast unmethilated or hypomethilated CpGs can lead overexpression of particular genes. One of the significant function of CpG island methylation is  to silence the transposible elements and prevent genome instability.<br />During cancer CpG islands are hypomethilated in promotors of oncogenes, while CpGs of tumor suppressor genes  are hypermethylated. Epigenetic mistakes such as alteration of DNA methylation  at CpG islands can cause tumourogenesis, although epigenetic silencing of only one copy of the two alleles of tumor suppressor is not sufficient to cause cancer. In many types of cancers e.g. retinoblastoma  if individual  will inherit from parents one mutation in the one copy and  second hit  can be mutation of another copy of RB gene as well as this another copy can be hypermethylated.<br />Most of the human genome is made up of the intergenic regions or repetitive elements. CpGs of these regions are methylated in normal tissues which prevents transcriptional noises of our genome. In cancer these regions tend to become  hypomethylated, Genome - wide hypomethilation is the remarkable epigenetic abnormality during most of types of cancer.  Hypomethilation of repeats/intergenic regions can lead genome instability which includes recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition or in another word abnormal karyotype.  <br />In conclusion, contribution of DNA methylation to cancer is  genome-wide hypomethylation and  hypermethylation of  tumour suppressor gens.<br /> <br /><br /><br /> </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In cancer impront control region (ICR) can be hypermethylated and also in some particular cases can be hypomethylated.<br />In case of Igf2/H19  claster in normal cells ICR is methylated on the paternal allele, and it's unmethylated on the maternal allele. On the maternal allele insulator  protein CTCF will bind  unmethilated ICR and enhancer can act on H19, but Igf2 will be silenced. On paternal allele as ICR is methylated CTCF do not bind to ICR and enhancer act on Igf2, which is a growth promoting factor, so Igf2 is expressed from the paternal allele. In case of Wilm's tumour ICR on the maternal allele is hypermethylated and Igf2 is exspressed from maternal allele as well, so there is a double dose of Igf2, which is assosiated with childhood kidney tumour Wilm's tumour. In this example loss of imprinting is occurs that lead to this particular type of cancer. <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">One of the epigenetic  drug Decitabine or 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitory agent which is approved by FDA for treatment of hematologic malignancy such as myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. It functions in a similar manner to 5-aza-citidine (5-azaC). Both 5-aza-dC and 5-azaC are analogues of cytosine, that when incorporated into DNA, irreversibly binds the methyltransferase enzymes  and its DNA methyltransferase function is blocked. This  results in passive and progressive de-methylation <span>and reversal of gene silencing </span>(Michalowsky LA, Jones PA, 1987).  </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Changes in DNA methylation  can cause on hypomethylation of intragenic repeats such as LINE and SINE, which results in genome instability and Genome-wide DNA hypomethylation. Altered DNA methylation  is also causes on deregulation of imprint control region and loss of imprinting as well as silencing of tumor suppressor genes. Sensitive period is when epigenetic reprogramming occurs. These events happened during early development after fertilization and during primordial germ cells development. In zygote particular epigenetic marks will be removed and particular set of gens will re-express. Second round of reprogramming occurs during germ cells formation. Germ cells are derived from somatic cells, so  both  paternal and maternal genome   are cleared and resetting of epigenetic marks in the germ cells happens.  <br />Treatment of patients with epigenetic drugs during sensitive period is inadvisable because of epigenetic enzymes such as DNA methyltransferases, histone-deacetylases, histone methyltransferases and so on are very important at this period of development as they attache and remove epigenetic marks and  inhibition of these enzymes  may results for instance in  deregulation of imprinting, disruption of X inactivation, and many other epigenetic abnormalities. </div>
