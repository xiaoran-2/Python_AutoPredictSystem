    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation almost exclusively occurs at CpG dinucleotides in mamals often at promotor of genes and is associated with formation of repressive chromatin structures, they can be bound with methylated CpG binding proteins which have ability to recruit other factors that condense chromatin, in that way it can alter genes expression and helps to maintain genome stability. During cancer we can notice hypomethylation of CpG dinucleotides, this can promote genomic instability and activate oncogenes. On the contrary, in normal cells we can see hypomethylation of CpG islands, they tend to be protected of methylation but during carcinogenesis they become hypermethylated  and consequence is increased genome instability.<br />In normal cells, intergenic region are usually methylated to maintain genomic integrity and silence cryptic transcriptional start sites or cryptic splice sites, during cancer, we can notice genome wide hypomethylation of intergenic regions which might have consequence on genome stability and activate cryptic transcriptional start and splice sites.<br />Repetitive elements are normally methylated from many reasons, to prevent transpositions, to avoid transcriptional interferences, to prevent illegimate recombination and this is considered   as genome defense model. During tumor-geneses they become hypomethylated which leads to genomic instability <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">When we look at genome, we see that two genes, Igf2 and H19 have mutual promotor and enhancers. If we look at paternal alleles, we see that ICR methylation and methylation of H19 so activated enhancers affect Igf2 and activate it so expression of Igf2 is paternally transmitted. On the contrary, at mother's chromosome, CTCF protein is binding to ICR and activation of Igf2 is blocked but enhancers activate H19 so expression of H19 is maternally transmitted. We can say that CTCF is insulator protein because it separates Igf2 from enhancers.<br />In Wilm's tumour we can notice bipaternal epigenotype at this loci with H19 inactive and Igf2 biallelically active, if we know that H19 is considered as tumor suppressor gene and Igf2 and oncogene, it's clear that this will promote cancerogeneses. This can happens because of loss of heterozygosity <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is chemically cytidine analog, it's hypomethylating agent because it inhibits DNA methyltransferase. As nucleoside analog it can incorporate into DNA and bind DNMT to stop methylation which is very important in hematological malignancy because they are dependant on tumor suppressor  hypermethylation. DNMT is enzyme, methyl transferase and in human cancer cells DNMT1 is responsible for both, de novo and maintenance methylations of tumor suprressor genes. So, when Decitabine bind DNMT1 it can stop hypermethylation or reduce it. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA is probably most stable epigenetic mark, it is meiotic and mitotic heritable and connected with silencing and activating genes. In cancer cells we have hypermethylation of CpG islands and hypermetylation of tumor suppressor genes, if we use drugs that can decrease hypermethylation  of tumor suprressor genes it will improve treatment. <br />Sensitive period in sense of epigenetic is early fetal period and period during forming of germ cells, it is sensitive because that is period when epigenetic marks are established. If we disrupt establishing of normal epigenetic marks it can leads to syndromes (Beckwith-Wiedmann syndrome) or tumorigenesis. Treating young patients during sensitive periods could lead to epigenetic disorders on progeny <br /></div>
