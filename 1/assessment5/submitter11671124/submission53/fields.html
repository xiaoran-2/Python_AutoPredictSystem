    <div class="field-value"><p>

</p><p>Normally the methylation of DNA differ
between different parts of the genome, the normal methylation state of CpG
islands and intergenic regions or repetitive elements are different.</p><p>

</p><p><span>The CpG islands are mostly not
methylated in normal case, so what cancer does is altering it to a methylated
areas and that may leads to silencing tumour suppressor genes, with those genes
silenced, the balance between the oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes is
already off, the cells affected will by time outlive and outnumber the normal
cells, causing cancer. Of course this is an element in many needed to have
cancer but it is an important one and has a huge contribution to cancer,
however those CpG islands affected can be helpful in the diagnosis , prognosis
and the course of treatment for cancer wither we consider them as singles or
sets of islands ,they help to Id  features, types or sub-types of cancer ,help
to differ normal cells from the cancerous cells, predict the prognosis or the
result of a certain treatment with a certain type of cancer, etc.      </span></p><p>

</p><p>Moving to the intergenic regions and
repetitive elements, those parts of the genome are normally methylated and that
is because this methylation plays an important role in the genome stability, what
cancer does is altering the state of methylation of intergenic regions and
repetitive elements to a less or hypo methylated one, and that usually happens
early in cancer and progresses with time, affecting the stability of the genome
by allowing abnormal or unwanted recombination between repeats, and activating some
parts of the genome that should normally be silenced wither it is repeats or
promotors, thus affecting other nearby genes witch may play a role in the
growth control of the cell or other important functions.</p><p><span>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The disruption of
imprinting can for sure affect the expression of genes , instead of having one
allele silenced and the other allele expressed , if the imprinting is disrupted
we end up having both the alleles expressed or both silenced ,for example the H19/Igf2 cluster:
normally on the paternal allele the ICR is methylated ,so the H19 are not
expressed and the enhancers act only on Igf2 ( growth promotor ) ,while ICR on
the maternal allele are not methylated ,and that allows the CTCF to bind with
the ICR ,preventing the enhancers from acting on the Igf2 ,so it will only act
on H19.</p>

<span>However in the case
of Wilm’s tumour both the alleles have the ICR methylated, which means the
enhancers now act on Igf2 on both alleles, and that means double the expression
of Igf2 comparing to normal, and since the Igf2 is a growth promotor gene, the
double expression will lead to more or faster growth, and that is how it
contributes to cancer.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug that belongs to
DNMTi epigenetic inhibitor class of drugs, a class that have two drugs approved
by FDA: Decitabine and Vidaza, and is usually used to treat cases of
myelodysplastic syndrome progresses to AML.</p>

<span>So when a mother cell
divides to daughter cells, the methylated DNA in the mother cell will be passed
on, however only one of the two strains in the daughter cell’s DNA will be
methylated, and here comes one of the roles of DNMT that will make sure to have
both strains methylated, however when Decitabine is used, it makes the DNMT
binding irreversible, affecting the methylation mechanism, and with less
methylation we are going to have less silencing of genes, including the tumour
suppressor genes that have a huge role in cancer when silenced, so having these
genes expressed is an important anti-tumour effect of Decitabine and other
DNMTi drugs.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Epigenetic drugs can’t always differentiate between normal and cancerous
cells, they affect both, and it lasts longer than the time of treatment,
meaning greater effect on normal cells, e.g. DNA methylation, cells normally keep
its methylation stable except for the sensitive periods which are periods of
time when epigenetic marks are removed or reprogramed, they differ between
different marks ,but for paternal and maternal genome it is primordial germ
cell development and preimplantation early development, during these periods
the epigenetic state is reset or reprogramed including DNA methylation, however
when using epigenetics drugs like DNMTi, the effect is irreversible and would
alter the DNA methylation and the epigenetic profile of cells, and since it is irreversible
it won’t go back to normal when we stop using DNMTi.</span></p><span>

<span>Since cancerous cells
divide more rapidly than normal cells, the effect of drugs is greater on them
since the division and reprogramming during the course of treatment is more, making them more sensitive to changes applied by drugs, however in
 sensitive periods, normal cells are also reprogramming, and more
sensitive to drugs than other times, meaning more unwanted results and side
effects of treatments, that is why treatment during sensitive periods is
inadvisable.</span></span></div>
