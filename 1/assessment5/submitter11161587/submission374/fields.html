    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>In normal cells, CpG islands are normally hypomethylated. The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to silence or downregulate a gene. Once a gene is silenced by methylation, this silencing is transferred to the daughter cells.</li><li>In cancer cells, CpG islands are more likely to be methylated. This hypermethylation is an alternative to genetic mutation to silence tumour suppressor genes in cancer.</li><li>DNA hypermethylation and epigenetic silencing of tumour suppressor genes results in one of the hits to DNA that leads to tumorigenesis. Hypermethylation increases with tumorigenicity. CpG islands hypermethylation varies by tumour and progresses in time. The silencing of tumour suppressor genes leads to an uncontrollable cell growth and tumour development.</li><li>In normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are more likely to be hypermethylated. This occurs to prevent transcription from happening in places it has no sense happening and maintain genomic integrity.</li><li>In cancer cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally hypomethylated. Because of this genome-wide lack of methylation, transcription takes place in regions it is no business happening.</li><li>DNA hypomethylation of repeats or intergenic regions leads to genomic instability due to illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes. This hypomethylation progresses with tumorigenicity. </li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>In the H19/Igf2 cluster we find that in the paternal allele the ICR is methylated and in the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated. CTCF is an insulator protein that binds to the ICR of the maternal allele, insulates Igf2 and because of this the downstream enhancers are free to act on H19, promoting its expression. CTCF complex does not bind to the ICR of the paternal allele because this ICR is methylated, so DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence and enhancers can access Igf2 to actívate it. Then, in a normal cell, Igf2 will be expressed in the paternal allele but not in the maternal allele.</li><li>In Wilm's tumour, ICR in the maternal allele is methylated (ICR hypermethylation), so the maternal allele behaves like the paternal one (no expression of H19 and expression of Igf2).</li><li>This disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster explained previously, leads to an upregulation of Igf2, that means that we have an overdose of Igf2 (oncogene, growth-promoting) and no dose of H19.</li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Decitabine belongs to a class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNA demethylating agents).</li><li>Acting as DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, Decitabine contributes to hypomethylation of DNA. Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue, so it gets incorporated to the DNA upon replication and then when the DNMT comes along to bind with the nucleotide and copy the methylation to the other strand then the DNMT get bind irreversibly so it cannot work.</li><li>The mechanism of action of Decitabine is still unclear, but binding the DNMT and inhibiting it leads to hypomethylation and reactivation of epigenetically silenced tumour suppressor genes.</li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Epigenetic marks, and DNA methylation as one of them, are mitotically heritable. It's because of this that the effect of this kind of treatments have enduring effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment (Ex. DNMT methylation marks are preserved during the mitosis).</li><li>A sensitive period is the one in the epigenetic reprogramming takes place. These periods are the early embryionic development and germ cell development.</li><li>Treating patients with this kind of treatments during sensitive periods would be dangerous because these are the moments when the epigenetic reprogramming takes place, so treating females that are pregnant or are trying to get pregnant or males that are trying to father a child could lead to congenital malformations or increased embryofetal loss.</li></ul></div>
