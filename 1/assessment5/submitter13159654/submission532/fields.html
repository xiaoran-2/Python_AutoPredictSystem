    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG island methylation  is related with gene silencing.  This mechanism is essential for the maintance of imprinted genes  and is crtitical in determining cell specific patterns of gene expression. Typical CpG islands are devoid of methylation allowing the expression of particular genes . In the neoplasic cell  certain CpG island of tumour suppresor genes are hypermethylated.  In a normal cell CpG islands  inside promotores show low levels of cyosine methylation , but high levels of methylation could be found inside intergenic regions and repetitive DNA .   Repetitive elements methylation is related with the suppression of transcription and inhibition of transposition.  When cáncer cells are analyzed   high levels of promoter CpG methylation is found   even though global hypomethylation levels  had been described.  CpG island  are frequent in tumour suppresor genes (Rb, MLH1, BRCA1, MGMT), in cáncer cells this genes are silent because of their promoter hypermethylation.  on the other hand Global hypomethylation affects repetitive elements , when the silencing of this regions are defective  improper recombination is promoted. Also the activation of transponsonable elements could favor the activation of genes which expression is   regulated , or silenced, by them.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of Imprinting is frequently seen in cáncer cells. This could be related with the overexpression of cell growth and proliferation related genes.Or with the loss of expression  of tummor supresor genes. This effect depend on the methylation (hypo or hyper) found in the promoters of this genes. Is important to recognize that the patterns of DNA hypermethylation varies  among cancers. On example of this is IgF2 expression.</p><p>In a normal cell the paternal allele of Igf2  has a  methylated ICR. Methylation of this regions suppresses the recognition by an insulator  allowing the interaction between the ICR and an enhancer. This interaction promotes  IGF2 expression. In the maternal allele the  ICR is non methylated, so the binding of an insulator inhibits the interaction with the enhancer  blocking the expression of the Igf2 GENE. This is an imprinted locus where the paternal allele expresses IgF2 and the maternal expresses H19.</p><p>In Wills Tumour. both alleles have the ICR methylated, so both of them act as  the paternal allele. This means that this patiens have elevated levels of the Igf2 protein. This protein is a growth factor, so elevated levels of this protein promotes a disregulated cell cycle that will end up in cáncer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is the type of drugs usually known as antimetabolite.  This drug is a cytosine analog that once incorporated into DNA links nonreversible to DNA methyltransferase .  If DNA methyltransferases can´t be used for proper DNA methylation (  because of DNA methyltransferase depletion)  after DNA replication passive hypomethylation is found.  When Decitabine is used at low doses it induced DNA hypomethylation, therby promoting cell differentiation, re-expression of tumor supresor genes and suppression of tumor growth. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>An important aspect of DNA methylation is that it is mytotically heridatable. They are passed from the cell to the daughter to the granddaughter until it is erased. Once it is erased it cant return.  We know that with this theraphies we are promoting a passive hypomethyltaion. Each cell division more levels of methylation are lost. Finally we have an hypomethylated DNA that is much more sensitive to other drugs. A lot of chemotherapheutic drugs are clastogens, they promote DNA doublé strand breaks, hypomethylation is associated with chromosomal instability so hypomethylated cells are more sensitive to this treatments. </p><p>A sensitive period is when methylation is reset. This period are found during primordial germ cell development and while the blastocist is formed. This periods are crucial for drug administration because  it could promote a modification in the epigenetic programming, It could modify the pattern of imprinted genes, already we ´ve discussed it is related with cáncer or several genomic syndromes,or   promote chromosomal instability. So the use of this theraphies in younger patients should be considered </p></div>
