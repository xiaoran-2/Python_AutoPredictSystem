    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is essential for normal development.DNA methylation typically occurs in a CpG dinucleotide context. In normal cells unmethylated CpGs are often grouped in clusters called CpG ilands, which are present in the 5' regulatory regionns of many genes.The<div>genome in general is methylated in their repetitive elements through the intergenic regions and indeed even in the introns of genes.<br /><div>In contrast, if you look in general at a cancer cell, now the CpG islands are more likely to be methylated.</div><div>And the rest of the genome in general,including the repetitive elements in these intergenic elements, and indeed, the introns, are hypomethylated.</div><div>So this is, tends to be called CpG island hypermethylation, or CGI hypermethylation.And in general when you look at where these CpG</div><div>islands are found, they're in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes.So this is because if you think about the way that a cancer cell is able to inactivate tumour suppressor genes, it could do so genetically, or it could happen epigenetically by silencing the tumour suppressor gene by locking in a silent inactive state leading to rapidly dididing cells and growing to cancer.<br />We have normally hypermethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements that is associated with greater genomic stability, but tha opposite is seen in cancer (Hypomethylation) leading to genomic instability  such as deletions,insertions or translocations in the chromosomes.</div><div><br /></div></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>One of the really common features of cancer cells is they display loss of imprinting. So in other words, genes that should be displaying monoallelic parent-of-origin-specific expression, they're imprinted, no longer show this imprint of expression but rather they become either expressed from both parental alleles or silent from both parental alleles. I describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines Igf2 expression status. When it's unmethylated CTCF will binds this insulator element, and it means that the enhancers in this case will act on H19. But Igf2 will be silent for the maternal allele, so we don't see expression. On the paternal allele, because this is methylated, now the enhancers can act on Igf2, because CTCF is not binding to inhibit this, and IGF2 is expressed from the pattern allele. However, with loss of imprinting and what happened is you have hypermethylation of the imprint control region on the maternal allele as well, now, on the maternal allele, you also have expression of Igf2. So now you have a double dose of Igf2 in comparison to what you saw in a normal cell.And Igf2 is growth promoting, and this is associated with Wilms’ tumour. The same thing is observed in most tumors.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">This drug belongs to DNA-demethylating agents(DNA methytransferase inhibitors). <br /> It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting  DNA methyltransferase.By this process of demethylation, normal function to the tumor suppressor genes is restored, thus restoring control over cell growth.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is a particularly attractive form of regulation to target in treatments because it
can be manipulated once, and enduring effects are ensured as the DNA methyltransferase
enzymes preserve methyl marks during mitosis. However, these global interventions may
interfere with ordinary functioning of the system, especially during critical periods ­­ periods of
time where extensive epigenetic reprogramming occurs. In particular, it would be inadvisable to
prescribe these treatments to pregnant mothers (including a few months before conception) as
a lot of reprogramming happens in early child development as well as during the formation of
gametes (both male and female)</div>
