    <div class="field-value">The global level of DNA methylation decreases in cancer tissues when compared to normal tissues (<strong>cancer shows genome-wide DNA hypomethylation</strong>).On the other hand, CpG islands are more likely to be hypermethylated  at cancer cells (<strong>locus specific hypermethylation</strong>), as opposed to what happens in normal cells, where CpG islands are hypomethylated. CpG islands are normally associated with a gene promoter. Therefore, by methylating the CpG island, the corresponding gene is silenced (methylation effect = silencing). These CpG islands that get hypermethylated usually correspond to tumour suppresor genes, that therefore get silenced. By<strong> silencing these suppresors</strong>, the cells get a competitive advantage over the surrounding ones and are more able to quickly divide and to not die. Since <strong>methylation is mitotically heritable</strong>, these suppresor genes get epigenetically locked silenced for all the daughter cells. CpG island hypermethylation progresses with time. CpG island shores are also usually hypermethylated in cancer.<br />Repetitive elements through the intergenic regions are normally methylated. By methylating these regions/repeats, genomic stability is maintained. Cancer is however characterised by an early <strong>hypomethylation of repeats/intergenic regions</strong> that progresses with time and that results in <strong>genomic instability</strong> characterised by illegitimate recombination between repeats (e.g. reciprocal translocations between different chromosomes), repeats becoming activated and transposed, thereby disrupting the coding region of the gene where they get inserted or genes downstream, and/or activate neighbouring genes (e.g. cryptic promoters), chromosome deletions or insertions, etc. This all results in transcriptional aberration.<br /><strong>Poor promoters can get activated</strong> (less frequent) by getting hypomethylated in cancer (e.g. oncogene R-RAS in gastric cancer).<br /><strong>Imprint control regions loose their imprinting</strong>, so that growth promoting genes get overexpressed (e.g. Igf2) or growth restricting genes get hypermethylated/silenced.<br /><strong>DNA methylation alteration effects</strong> in cancer depend on whether the cancer is driven mainly by tumour suppressor hypermethylation or by genomic instability from global hypomethylation (<strong>context-dependent</strong>) .<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Under normal conditions, the imprint control region <b>(ICR) of the paternal allele in the Igf2/H19 cluster is methylated and unmethylated in the maternal allele</b>. The unmethylated ICR of the maternal allele gets bound to a insulator element (CTCF) which impedes that the neighbouring enhancers act on the Igf2 gene (they act on the H19 gene). <b>Igf2 is thus silent for the maternal allele</b>. The methylation of the ICR of the paternal allele does not allow an insulator to get bound to the ICR and thereby enhancers can act on Igf2.<b> Igf2 is a growth promoting gene, expressed only from the paternal allele </b>in normal cells<b>.</b><br /><b>In cancer both paternal and maternal allele ICRs</b> of the Igf2/H19 cluster get <b>methylated</b> (i.e. hypermethylated). Since CTCF cannot get bound to the ICR (as opposed to what happens in the maternal allele under normal conditions), the enhancers act on the Igf2 genes on both alleles, resulting in an <b>overexpression of the Igf2 gene</b> (two doses instead of one). Since Igf2 is growth promoting, loss of imprinting in the Igf2/H19 cluster (ICR hypermethylation / overexpression of Icf2) promotes growth and is associated with <b>Wilm's tumour.</b><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a<b> DNA-demethylating agent</b>. It hypomethylates DNA by <b>inhibiting DNA methyltransferase</b>. It is a nucleoside analog that gets incorporated into the DNA upon replication, so that when the DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) comes along to bind the nucleotide in order to copy the methylation to the daughter strand, the DNMT1 gets bound thereto and can no longer be released. DNMT1 gets thus depleted and mitotical heritability of DNA methylation is restricted (which presumably limits CpG island hypermethylation progression). This epigenetic inhibitor is not specific in its action but probablly hits all dividing cells (cancer and normal cells). Since the action of decitabine depends on cell division and<b> cancer cells are replicated more rapidly, these can get more dramatically affected</b> by this drug and it has been shown that for fairly low doses this drug has a good anti-neoplastic effect. It has been commonly used in myelodysplastic syndrome.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is <b>mitotically heritable</b>. During cell division, DNMT1 copies the methylation patterns from the parent to the daughter DNA strand. Thereby, daughter cells' DNA inherits the parent's methylation patterns. Any epigenetic change altering DNA methylation (resulting e.g. from cancer or an epigenetic drug) results in all daughter cells also having this epigenetic change. Consequently, <b>drugs that alter DNA methylation</b> (such as decitabine, a DNA demethylating agent) <b>have an effect on daughter cells that gets further replicated</b>, therefore having an<b> enduring effect</b> on the epigenome (daughter and granddaugher cells becoming e.g. demethylated by decitabine's effect, thereby counteracting cancer CpG island hypermethylation). This happens in adult cells, which are not in a sensitive period, the effects of epigenetic change depending on cell division. <br />Attention has to be paid to<b> epigenetic-drug use on younger patients</b> (e.g. 8-10 year old girls, 9-12 year old boys) because this is a <b>sensitive period for primordial cell development</b>. <b>Sensitive periods</b> are periods where <b>epigenetic marks are established</b>  (primordial germ cell development and pre-implantation/early-post-implantation period), where<b> environmental disruptions may negatively influence epigenetic makeup. </b>Use of epigenetic drugs on this child sensitive period may <b>affect the epigenetic programming of the gametes</b>, resulting in epigenetic changes affecting future generations.<br /><br /></div>
