    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The CpG islands, found majority in
promoters of genes, are usually unmethylated. The CpG islands tend to be
protected against methylation. However, in cancer, the CpG island and CpG
island shores, which are 2kb sequences around CpG island, tend to be
hypermethylated. The hypermethylation on both regions contributes to cancer
because it silence tumour suppressor genes that are normally expressed in
normal cells with important functions of decreased proliferation, apoptosis
signals and etc. Examples of tumour supress genes that are inactive in cancer
cells by DNA methylation are RB gene in retinoblastoma and BRCA1 gene in breast
cancer. Also, tumour can accumulate DNA methylation during progression and
hypermethylation differ by tumour type. However, there are CpG poor promoters that
are hypomethylation but it is less common. They can result in activation of
genes in cancer cells, the oncogenes. By instance, R-Ras gene is active in
gastric cancer. The intergenic regions and repetitive elements, as
intracisternal A particle - IAP, are normally hypermethylated in normal cells.
This is because the hypermethylation silence cryptic transcription start side
and splice site for intergenic regions and as a genome defense model in
repetitive elements. In both regions hypermethylation maintain genomic
integrity. However, in cancer cells there is hypomethylation of intergenic
regions and repetitive elements. It leads to cancer because it creates genomic
instability, a feature of cancer, by chromosome deletion, reciprocal
translocation, insertion and duplication. Also, there is activation of repeats
and transposons and activation cryptic promoters and genes around that are
disturbed. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>In the paternal allele, the imprinted
control region (ICR) is methylated. It can block the binding of CTCF, an
insulator protein, in ICR and DNA methylation in this region can spread
downstream into H19 promotor gene, a long noncoding RNA, and silencing it. So
enhancers in paternal allele can access the Igf2 gene, activating and so it is expressed.
In the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated which leads to CTCF binding in
ICR. This insulates the activity of enhancers on Igf2 gene, leading to
inactivation of Igf2 gene. The H19 promotor gene is free of methylation so it
is expressed. In Wilm's tumour, a nephoblastoma cancer that characteristically
occurs in kids, it has the hypermethylation of ICR in maternal and paternal
alleles, which leads to enhancer activity on Igf2 gene on both alleles since
CTFC is blocked from DNA methylation. 
This leads to expression of Igf2 gene on both alleles, arising a double
dose of the gene. The H19 promoter gene is methylated on both alleles so is not
expressed. The disruption on H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer because it
results in overexpression of growth promotor gene and uncontrolled
proliferation of cells is one of the features of cancer.<u></u></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The Decitabine drug is a DNA
methytransferase inhibitor (DNMT inhibitor). The way Decitabine works is to inhibit
DNMT to bind in methylated DNA. This drug is a nucleoside analogue that once is
incorporated into DNA, after replication, they can no longer leave because are
irreversibility bound to DNA. So DNMT1 cannot bind this methyl group to
reproduce to the other DNA strand once Decitabine was used. The Decitabine have
anti-tumour effect because, at a lower level of the drug, the effect of DNA
demethylation is higher, since cancer cells have the capacity to rapidly
proliferate, they can replicate more than a normal cell and so, are severe
affected, once the lack of methylation can drive the cells to genomic
instability and cell death since some regions of DNA need to be methylated.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>A sensitive period is a stage that cells undergo
epigenetic reprogramming, an alteration in epigenetic marks along time of
development. There are two sensitive periods: primordial germ cell development
(PGC) and early embryonic development. In early embryonic development, there is
the removal of epigenetics marks. In PGC development, also happen so somatic
cells become germ cells. In epigenetic reprogramming, during early embryonic
development, the DNA is demethylated actively and rapidly in paternal genome and
passively in maternal genome. The epigenetics marks are re-established for both
and maintained in somatic cells after embryo implantation. During PGC
development, both maternal and paternal genomes are DNA demethylated in a
different rate due the different dynamic between oocyte and sperm. Others
regions of DNA undergo different epigenetic reprogramming. While repetitive elements
are highly methylated, imprinted genes only undergo DNA demethylation during
PGC development. The treatment of patients during sensitive period is not advisable
because on both periods the cells have resetting of epigenetics marks. The
epigenetics drugs, as DNMT inhibitors, their effect will be erased on theses
two periods, which means DNA demethylation. 
So, the patients will loose the effect of the drug, not responding to
it, letting the cancer to continue to grow. </span></div>
