    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands becomes more dense as DNA methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer by decreasing in the overall progression from normal to metastatic this disruption is either hypomethalated or hypermethalated the former is reversible the latter found  in tumour supressor genes CpG islands belong to tumour supressor genes and the DNA methylation is increased in tumour supressor genes to contribute to cancer genes are silenced<br />The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions  RNA needed for pluripotency and differentiation and repetitive elements  such as intergenic methalation at sattelitte repeats and remnants of retroviral insertions <span>the disruption in cancer occurs with intergenic regions and repetitive elements being decreased   a link between DNA methylation and histone modifications is explored thus disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to cancer due to mutations occurring recruiting chromatin</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Hypermethalation of imprint control regions involved in growth the paternal allele expressed from both or silenced from both parental alleles methylated on the paternal allele Igf2 unmethalated the maternal allele over expression of Igf2 associated with Wilms tumour often seen in pre neoplasticism tissue loss of imprinting H19 acted on by enhancers in maternal hyper or hypo methaylation can apply</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a hypomethylation agent inhibiting the methyltransferase of DNA since it is used for treatment of blood disorders it is used to treat acute myeloid leukaemia and if proven effective in cases of bloodbourne disease can be useful in creating a prophylaxis for certain cancers <br />acknowledgement Wikipedia</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the genome by making drug resistant or hard to reach cancers and diseases negotiable to adaptations in treatments and pharmacology a sensitive period is the times of germ cell development. And pre implantation the nervous system is susceptible to environmental influences at this time and since psychologically it is a time where learning is difficult treatment can result in delayed motor skills in children and infants</span></div>
