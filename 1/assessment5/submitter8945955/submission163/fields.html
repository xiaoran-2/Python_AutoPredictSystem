    <div class="field-value">Methylation of CpG sites in promoter regions normally acts to inhibit gene expression, however, CpG islands are exceptions and are normally unmethylated, allowing gene expression. <br /><br />In cancer, however, these unmethylated CpG islands become hypermethylated, leading to silencing of the underlying gene, negating any tumour-suppressor roles.<br /><br />One of the primary functions of DNA methylation is to maintain genomic stability.  When methylation of repeats and intergenic regions proceeds normally, the loss, gains, and illegitimate recombinations of chromosomes is prevented.  In normally methylated cells, alignments of genetic material proceeds normally owing to the methylation of the repeats and the genetic material being in regions of heterochromatin, which prevents illegitimate recombinations.<br /><br />Cancerous cells exhibit altered DNA methylation - primarily a
 genome-wide loss and a regional increase in DNA methylation. This 
causes genomic instability, deregulation of tissue 
specific and imprinted genes, and also, by 
hypermethylation of their promoter CpG islands, silences tumour 
suppressor genes controlling the cellular life cycle, apoptosis, or DNA 
repair.  CpG islands become progressively more hypermethylated with 
cancer progression.  Developmental genes are sometimes silenced by DNA 
methylation in cancer cells, providing a silencing system that 
promotes cancer development.<br /><br />Whereas genome-wide hypermethylation contributes to genomic 
stability, hypermethylation of tumour-suppressor genes leads to the 
favouring of cancerous conditions.<br /><br />In the intergenic regions and repetitive elements of normal cells, 
there is a high degree of methylation. However, in cancerous cells, 
these intergenic regions and repetitive elements are instead 
hypomethylated.<br /><br />Hypomethylation of repeats results in genes being located in open 
chromatin, allowing illegitimate recombination between repeats due to 
misalignment of genetic material, which in turn leads to the development
 of abnormal karyotypes.<br /><br />Repeats activated by unwanted hypomethylation can activate neighbouring genes, creating unwanted insertions, deletions 
and genomic instability.  Activation can be of oncogenes, and may lead 
to suppression of tumour suppressor genes, leading to enhanced risk of 
cancer.<br /><br />Nuclear structure including chromatin texture is altered in tumour cells, which facilitates deregulated gene expression patterns, altered chromatin structure, altered DNA methylation, and altered epigenetic patterning.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Lots of genes that are imprinted are involved in growth.  These genes can, when accidentally activated, lead to uncontrolled and unwanted growth of tissues.  <br /><br />In the case of the H19/IGF2 cluster, in the maternal allele, the imprint control region is normally unmethylated, facilitating the binding of the insulator element, CTCF, which in turn means the enhancers will act on H19, with no expression of the silenced IGF2.<br /><br />In the paternal allele, where the imprint control region is methylated, the insulator element CTCF is prevented from binding with the imprint control region, which means the enhancers will act to express IGF2, and not H19.<br /><br />In cancer you can find undesired hyper-, or hypo-methylation in 
imprint control regions, which can drastically alter the function of the
 imprint control region, and the expression of related genes.<br /><br />Returning to the H19/IGF2 cluster, with loss of imprinting you get hypermethylation of the imprint control region, the insulator element CTCF is therefore prevented from binding with the imprint control region, leading to expression of IGF2 on the maternal allele, as well as the paternal allele.  This literally doubles the production of IGF2.<br /><br />IGF2 is growth promoting, and the extra expression of IGF2 is associated with Wilm's Tumour - a childhood kidney tumour.  Neoplastic tissue growths in any other location would also be stimulated by the extra IGF2.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is classed as a dna-methyl-transferase-inhibitor, which means it can chemically remove epigenetic methylation marks on the genome that can determine cellular development and function.  It does this by blocking DNA-Methyl-transferase, a key enzyme involved in methylation of genetic material during mitotic cell division.<br /><br />DNA demethylation by drugs such as Decitabine can lead to less gene-silencing of tumour suppressor genes, meaning cancerous cells are better controlled.<br /><p>Unlike other forms of gene regulation (like those 
involving transcription factors), epigenetic changes are 
passed on during cell division until
 they are actively erased. After they have been erased, though, they do not return.  Epigenetic therapies can
stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells - restoring or removing altered epigenetic marks enables the restoration of intended gene function, and therefore facilitates restoration of overall cellular function.</p>DNA demethylating drugs can induce epigenetic changes which may 
permanently alter tumour cells making them more susceptible to standard 
chemotherapy.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">As epigenetic marks can be mitotically heritable, they can be passed from generation to generation, meaning that any change in function that could be contributing to pathology can also be inherited through the epigenome, even if the genetic material has not been altered.<br /><br />Sensitive periods are periods when the environment may be able to influence epigenetic makeup - methylation marks may then be actively added or removed. <br /><br />Changing epigenetic marks is only possible when there is open 
chromatin.  Wherever there is euchromatin, epigenetic drugs have the 
potential to alter epigenetic marks on the genome.<br /><br />In mammals, sensitive periods include germ cell development - the time from primordial germ cell development through to gamete production.  A second sensitive period is the early embryonic development - the pre-implantation period, and the early post-implantation period.  These are periods of active remodelling of the epigenome, during which epigenetic marks are commonly removed and then actively laid down.  There are other periods, such as in tissue-specific development, when cells may also be particularly susceptible to epigenetic changes.<br /><br />Using epigenetic drugs during sensitive periods may mean there are 
unintended effects on other epigenetic marks which may have major 
unintended consequences.  Until we know more about these periods of 
development, it is advisable not to take unnecessary risks.<br /></div>
