    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation can be used to silence, or activate DNA. In CpG islands, methylation functions to silence genes. In cancer, hypermethylation occurs at CpG islands and shores. Hypermethylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer by silencing tumor suppressor genes. In intergenic and repetitive element regions there is normally a higher amount of methylation which can both activators or inactivators genes. In cancer, hypomethylation occurs in these regions. This hypomethylation results in the activation of oncognes, as well as genomic instability. Genomic instability can result in illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of transposition, and activation of cryptic promoter and disruption to neighboring genes. Activated oncogenes and genomic instability both contribute to cancer.<span class="_wysihtml5-temp"></span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">A loss of imprinting can result in the silencing of tumor suppressor genes and overexpression of growth inducing genes. In the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster, Igf2, which is a growth promoter, is doubly expressed, which results in cancer.  In a normal cell, the paternal allele is methlyated at both the H19 gene and the imprinting control region (ICR). The maternal allele is unmethlylated at both the H19 gene and the ICR. The unmethlyated maternal ICR is bound by CTCF which allows nearby enhancers to act on H19 and results in no expression of Igf2 and therefore no growth signal. Since the paternal ICR and H19 are methylated, the enhancers act of Igf2 resulting in a single dosage of Igf2, which is healthy and needed for cell growth. Imprinting is disrupted in Wilm's tumor by methylating at both the maternal and paternal ICRs and H19 genes. This causes the enhancers to act on both alleles of the Igf2.  A double dosage of Igf2 growth signaling results and contributes to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi). By inhibiting the DNMT demethylation occurs over time. Decitabine works as a nucleoside analog and incorporates into the DNA. When DNMT binds the DNA it becomes irreversibly bound to decitabine. This stops the DNMT from further methylating the DNA. When cell division occurs demethylation occurs and DNMT is not able to methylate again. The demethylation is able to inhibit tumor growth.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have effects that last beyond drug treatment because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. This means that epigenetic changes can be passed to daughter cells until they are actively erased. This is especially important to consider because DNA is very sensitive to epigenetic changes during certain periods. These periods occur when epigenetic marks are being laid down, or removed. Developmentally, the sensitive periods are the pre-implantation and germ cell stages. Because of this sensitivity treating a patient that is still developing germ cells would be inadvisable as harmful epigenetic changes could occur in these germ cells. </div>
