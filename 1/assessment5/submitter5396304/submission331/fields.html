    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Usually CpG islands are not methylated (hypomethylated), but in cancer cells often you can see an opposite pucture: CpG islands and 2kb shores near CpG islands are hypermethylated. Hypermethylation of CpG islands prevents normal gene expression, because such islands usually associated with gene promoters. Hypermethylation of CpG islands can silence different genes including tumor suppressor genes (for examle, brca1, mgmt). So it can cause cancer (or increase risk). Also it is known that it is common</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements (the biggest part of dna) should normally be silenced to provide genomic stability. Otherwise in the cell there are a lot of illigitimate recombinations between repeats, transpositions, dna duplications ans so on.</div><div><br /></div><div> But in cancer cell intergenic regions and repetitive elements are often hypomethylated. It causes huge number of dna mutations and influence to normal gene expression. General logic: Hypomethylated repetitive elements =&gt; genomic instability =&gt; more mutations =&gt; more risk of cancer. For example, deletion of dnmt1 can enhance or suppress tumorigenesis. </div><div>Hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters can activate dangerous genes (for example, miR21 expression which target tumour suppressor)</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Methylation pattern of paternal allele: ICR is methylated; H19 is silenced; enhancers allow to express lgf2.</div><div>Methylation pattern of maternal allele: ICR is unmethylated and binds with CTCF; enhancers impact H19 expression; so Igf2 is not expressed (enhancers impact H19, this gene is more closely located to enhanters)</div><div><br /></div><div>If ICR has hypermethylation, it changes maternal allele: ICR is methylated and not binds to CTCF, enhancers impact lgf2 expression. Consequently, in such cell H19 is not expressed and there is double dosage of Igf2. This cell disbalance is presented in Wilm's tumor.</div><div><br /></div><div>When such event occurs in very early child development, pre-neoplastic tissue, it contributes to cancer, because disrupted cells throw out the whole organism.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Decitabine belongs to an DNMTs inhibitor class (DNMTi). Decitabine has antineoplastic effect and inhibits DNA methyltransferase. So the effect is hypomethylation of daughter cells. Cancer cells divide more rapidly (often) than normal cells, so this inhibitor affects cancer cells more than normal. While it inhibit DNA methylation, the daughter cells can return to normal function (from hypermethylation to normal or hypomethylation). This inhibitor is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, because this kind of cancer is caused by DNA hypermethylation (mutation with H3K27 hystone mark, EZH2 methyltransferase).</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>The treatment people with "epigenetic drugs" has enduring effects on epigenome because it changes not only cancer cells, but also normal cells. Epigenetic changes in normal cells can also be inherited meiotically and mitotically. Sensitive period is a period when epigenetic treatment has too much risk in future development of organism (risk for life, for health). Sensitive period is childhood as well as early embryon development, because the organism is still forming and epigenetic changes can be fatal. </div><div><br /></div><div>There is also a risk for posterity. If the individual was treated by "epigenetic drugs", his/her future children can inherit epigenetic mistakes. Such treatment can have crucial/fatal effect for their development. So, sensitive periods for future posterity is pregnancy and childhood - for example, age from 9 to 12 years for individuals.</div></div>
