    <h1>Submission 289 from Anon (session_user_id: 1f69c24a27505410adff7f666431aac00bf5039c)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Proper DNA methylation plays essential role in keeping the chromatine in
desired shape for genome stability, proper genes expression or silencing, embryogenesis
and development. In cancer things may go wrong and methylation marks can appear
in places where they shouldn’t be or dissapear from the places where they
should be present. These unwanted epigenetic changes can be stable and passed
to next generations of cells causing tumour grow. New drugs adress the issue by
directly or indirectly acting on methylation trying to bring it back to a
normal state . There are two epigenetically sensitive periods in the human development:
when primordial germs cells form and during early embryo development, before
implantation. During these times the genome undergoes huge epigenetic changes –
reprogramming - that cause much of the methylation marks be removed to be reestablished
again later during development. These periods are possibly sensitive periods
for the cell, when drugs that are able to interact with the DNA and alter the
DNA methylation, which  can disrupt the
natural process and bring about harmful altererations, should be very carefully
applied, if not completely abandoned. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p><span>A healthy, normal,  cell is biochemically stable. Depending on the
cell’s function, what genes need to be expressed and what silenced – for a life time or
temporarily  - parts of the cell’s DNA chromatine
are loosely packaged, the other parts tighly
packaged, which results in their accessibility or inaccessibility, respectively,
for reading and transcription.  This
stable state of DNA is kept by epigenetic marks, one of which is  DNA methylation  - a simple addition of a methyl group  to the cytosine C bases, in mammals almost
exclusively those that preceed guanine G bases.  CpG dinucleotides can be sparsely spread
through the genome or occur in bulk in so called Cpg islands.  In normal cells, the majority of such sparsely
located CpG dinucleotides are found in  genes introns, repetitive elements, intragenic
regions,  where they are methylated, what
generally causes desirable silencing action upon these elements. CpGs in CpG
islands, which are present  in many  genes promoters,  usually stay unmethylated and the genes can be
expressed.  In cancer cells , though, the
situation reverses. When the cancerous state progresses, CpG dinucleotides  loose their methylation, while the CpG islands
gain. CpG islands
are found in the promoters of the critical for cells’ health genes like for
example tumor supressor genes, DNA repair or 
apoptosis madiator genes; hypermethylation of these regions  casues their silencing and results in aberrant
cells proliferation and functioning. The changes are heritable thru mitosis so
daughter cells also display this behaviour and the tumor is able to grow
rapidly.  Similary, when repetitive
elements or intergenic regions loose their methylation, they become abnormaly active,
can duplicate and jump around the genome, participate in illegitimate
chromosome recombinations or activate genes normally silent, which results in general
genome instability and cell malfunctioning. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>One of the common features of cancer cells is disruption of
gene imprinting.  For the cell’s health
it is vital that genes that come imprinted  from one parent stay imprinted for the cell’s
life time, and those that come not imprinted from the other parent, maintain
their not imprinted state. In cancer these genes often behave aberrantly - they
can either display expression from both alleles or silence from both allelles. One
such example is H19/lgf2 cluster with lgf2 gene,  which normally plays an essential role in
cells growth and division before birth. In the H19/lgf cluster of a normal cell,
the imprint control region (ICR),  along
with  H19 gene,  in the paternal allele should remain
methylated and silenced which results  in lgf2 expression, and in the maternal allele
should remain unmethylated and active, which results in lgf2 silencing (and H19
expression). With aberrant hypermethylation of the maternal allele the cell
expresses excessive, double amounts of lgf2 protein, which may stimulate the
growth of the tumour and prevent cancerous cells from being destroyed. This may
lead to certain syndromes associated with body overgrowth and to cancers  like  a
Wilm’s tumour, a rare childhood kidney cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a
drug used for treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes, a family of diseases
where blood cells display aberrant features and functionality due to excessive
methylation in <span>hematopoietic
 stem cells, from which blood cells
develop</span><span>. Decitabine acts in two ways: in small doses it is an
hypomethylating agent; it inhibits DNA methylation by blocking the activity of
DNA methyltransferaze and as a results it lowers the amounts of methylation
possibly reactivating genes that stop cancer grow, helps repair malfunctioning
mechanisms in cells and eventually lets the cancerous cells die. Research showed
that in small doses decitabine also causes antitumour responses  in breast, lung and colon cancers, as well as positive
response in metastatic tumors that eventually reduce their size and spread. When
supplied in standard high doses it has cytotoxic effect on cells both abnormal
and normal, and for this reason many experts ceased high-dosages treatments. </span></p></div>
