    <div class="field-value">The normal function of DNA methylation at the CpG islands is to add a methyl group (CH3) to the cytosine dinuleotides . While CpG islands preceding gene promoters are generally unmethylated  thus  allowing the symmetry between cells  to be maintained during mitotic inheritance.one of the functions of DNA methylation is to maintain genomic stability<br />DNA methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer because it is a heritable epigenetic mark involving the covalent transfer of a methyl group to the C-5 position of the cytosine ring of DNA and maintained by specific DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1, 3a and 3b)<br /><br /><br />In cancer there are numerous alterations or errors to this system  caused by hypermethylation  to CpG islands in promoter regions   including  a genome-wide loss  causing  on one hand genomic instability and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes and on the other hand silencing of tumor suppressor genes – controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair .The total amount of methylated cytosine is usually decreased resulting in global hypomethylation. Decreased cytosine methylation typically affects satellite DNA, repetitive sequences, and CpG sites located in gene bodies (introns and inner exons).<br /><br /><br />In intergenic regions repeats form the most important element in cancer  as they make sure you dont lose  or gain any chromosomes creating genomic stability.The genome is made up of these intergenic intervals or repetitive elements  where in <div>general you would find that the CpGs were methylated in a normal cell and repeats will be heavily methylated otherwise illigitimate recombination is allowed due to  open chromatin and  euchromatin structures. Repeats can also be </div><div>activated because of the hypomethylation and it is this process along with growth factors that can drive cell proliferation.Repeats can  jump or they they can activate promoters, then this can lead to transcriptional aberration in the surrounding region.</div><div><br /></div><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> In most tissues, only the paternally inherited copy is active;  the maternally inherited copy  is'nt.This is called genomic imprinting. DNA methylation is synonymous with
silencing but  this is not necessarily the case for imprint control regions.The IC1 region undergoes a process called methylation, Methylation of an imprint control region will tell you about whether its maternally or
paternally imprinted,.  H19 or Igf2 clusters are  also found
closely linked on human chromosome 11 but this is controlled in
a different way by enhancer blocking. In normal adult tissue maternal H19 allele is actively transcribed whereas the paternal allele is silenced by methylation. In contrast the paternal allele of IGF2 is active, the maternal allele is inactivated by methylation.Normally, the IGF2 gene undergoes genomic imprinting and only the copy inherited from a person's father is active. In some cancers, however, both the paternally inherited and the maternally inherited copies of the gene are active, increasing the amount of IGF2 that cells can produce. This phenomenon is known as loss of imprinting (LOI). An increased amount of IGF2 may stimulate the growth of tumor cells and prevent damaged cells from being destroyed. In Wilms tumour both maternal and paternal alleles are methylated resulting in biallelic activation of IGF2 and biallelic silencing of H19. </p><p><br /><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a class of inhibitor  known as DNMT inhibitor (hypomethylating agent) . DNMTs are enzymes that catalyze the addition of methyl groups to cytosine residues in DNA.DMNT (3a, 3b) work on unmethylated DNA and during mitosis to stabalise epigenetic marks as with each division is diluted .However in cancer there is a  loss of function which  occurs through epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation. Hypermethylation is an increase in  epigenetic methylation of cytosine and adenosine residues in DNA. DMNT inhibitor acts as a  hypomethylator of DNA.  Hypermethylation also plays a major role in cancer through transcriptional silencing of critical growth regulators such as tumor suppressor genes. The anti­tumour effect that has
been linked to reactivation of epigenetically silenced tumor supressor genes, induced by the hypothemylation. Thus it will push the cell through to apoptosis.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The epigenome is dynamic and responsive to environmental signals not only during development, but also throughout life.DNA methylation in regulatory regions such as promoters and enhancers could silence gene expression. Altered expression of receptors, signaling molecules, and other proteins necessary to alter genetic regulatory circuits occur even after having a bad nights sleep. There are periods in life which you  are more susceptable than  others. In particular,females are susceptable in terms of their germline (oocytes) before and during preganancy, whilst males are susceptable up towards puberty . Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance through the gametes can last  through generations."DNA methylation has been programming gene expression through promoter/enhancer methylation during gestation and embryonal development conferring cellular identity (<a href="http://toxsci.oxfordjournals.org/content/120/2/235.full#ref-135" title="Link: http://toxsci.oxfordjournals.org/content/120/2/235.full#ref-135">Razin and Riggs, 1980</a>), regulating X inactivation (<a href="http://toxsci.oxfordjournals.org/content/120/2/235.full#ref-139" title="Link: http://toxsci.oxfordjournals.org/content/120/2/235.full#ref-139">Riggs, 1975</a>), parental imprinting (<a href="http://toxsci.oxfordjournals.org/content/120/2/235.full#ref-143" title="Link: http://toxsci.oxfordjournals.org/content/120/2/235.full#ref-143">Sapienza, 1990</a>), and silencing parasitic elements in the genome (<a href="http://toxsci.oxfordjournals.org/content/120/2/235.full#ref-15" title="Link: http://toxsci.oxfordjournals.org/content/120/2/235.full#ref-15">Bestor, 1998</a>)".<span>Agents that affect DNA methylation might alter not only promoter function but also other processes regulated by DNA methylation such as silencing of spurious transcription initiated at the wrong positions in bodies of genes or in the antisense orientation, genome structure, and noncoding RNA transcription.</span></div>
