    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation plays a fundamental role in epigenetic events such as X chromosome inactivation, imprinting, and  heterochromatin formation.  It has been shown that, DNA methylation of promoter regions is inversely related with gene expression. CpG islands are found in about 60% of promoters and they are the exception and are known to have a high CpG density.  CpG islands have a tendency to stay unmethylated independent of their activity state.<br /><br />DNA methylation of CpG islands is known to be disrupted in cancer where promoters at CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated. <br /><br />The disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer mainly through hypermethylated CpG islands, which have been known to cause gene silencing.  In other cases,  methylation of promoters may contribute to changes in imprinting as seen in Wilm’s tumour.<span><br /><br /></span><div>Intragenic methylation is normally found at repetitive sequences  and remnants of retroviral insertions known as LINEs and SINEs in DNA. Gene body methylation is present in highly expressed genes. and it is speculated that this represses transcriptional noise from alternative start sites, inhibits antisense transcription, direct RNA splicing, and is related to replication events.</div><br />When DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer, the prognosis es affected.  Tumorigenicity increases with hypermethylation.   <br /><div>Also the hypomethylation of repeats can result in activation of genes.  An example is R-RAS in gastric cancer.  <br /><br /></div><div>Disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to cancer by resulting in loss of expression of growth restriction genes, and overexpression of growth promoting genes. <br /></div><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The methylation pattern of the paternal allele which determines Igf2 expression status in normal cells is dependent on methylation of the promoter at H19.    Igf2 is generally expressed only from the
paternal chromosome.<br /><br />The methylation pattern of the maternal allele which determines Igf2 expression status consists in an abnormal hypermethylation of the promoter at H19.   Igf2 maternal expression only ocurrs in the presence of Wilm’s tumour.  H19 may only be transcribed from the maternal allele. Whereas, the paternal H19 allele is not expressed.   In the maternal allele, Igf2 is not expressed in normal cells.  <span><br /><br /></span>The two genes of the H19/Igf2 cluster share enhancer elements and monoallelic expression
of both genes is dependent on cis-acting sequences upstream of the H19 promoter.  <br /><span><br />Hypermethylation of ICRs causes the loss of Imprintng.  Imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour and causes overexpression of Igf2.  Enhancers are also necessary for loss of imprinting to take place, while  methylation of the promoter region at H19 causes inactivation in both alleles. D</span>isrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster thus contributes to cancer.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent and <span>sold as Dacogen by Eisai, a Japanese company. It is used to treat
myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.<br /></span><p>The substance inhibits the activity of an enzyme called EZH2, which attaches methyl groups to histone proteins,that are part of the chromosomal packaging. Inhibiting the activity of the enzyme removes histone protein methylation.</p><p>In lymphomas, mutations that make EZH2 overactive are the known cause.  This overactivity
methylates histones more than normal and thus the genes they
surround are silenced, including tumour-suppressor genes that stop the
uncontrolled cell growth. Using Decitabine to demethylate histones should, in theory, reactivate the tumour-suppresor genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Stephen Baylin and colleagues have  shown that treatment with a histone-deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine slowed tumour growth in some
people with advanced lung cancer. They demonstrated for the first time, that epigenetic drugs could be used with success to fight a
solid tumour, instead of a leukaemia or a lymphoma. It is speculated that epigenetic drugs could alter the tumour cells in a lasting way that made them more susceptible to chemotherapy. Epigenetic changes may behave unlike other forms of gene
regulation and are passed on during cell division to daughter cells
until they are erased.  Epigenetic therapies thus demonstrate that cancer may be stopped without having to kill all cells.</p><p>Sensitive period refers to a period when methylation may be more susceptible to change such as during dna repair stages.  Others like the oovocyte stage or  the epiblast stage could also be vulnerable. Sensitive periods may also ocurr in adult cells when an organism suffers environmental exposure to toxins or circumstances that demethylate.</p><p>Treating patients during sensitive periods would run the risk of altering future gene expression in the offspring. </p><b>
