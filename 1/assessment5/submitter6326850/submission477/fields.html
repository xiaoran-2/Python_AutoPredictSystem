    <div class="field-value"><p>The research on genetic and epigenetic shown that addition of methyl groups are seen on specific regions of DNA. This is called DNA methylation. </p><p>DNA methylation is an inactive and stable epigenetic mark, mitotically heritable due to features of DNMT1. It is laid down by de novo methyltransferases DNMT3a and DNMT3b in mammals, and maintained by DNMT1 during cell division. When present, it is linked to the silencing of gene expression.</p><p>On <strong>normal cells</strong>, DNA methylation is not present at CpG islands. Chromatin is then poorly package on these regions. As the CpG islands are often located at promoters of genes, genes could be normally expressed.<br /></p><p>On intergenic regions and repetitive elements, DNA methylation is present, to avoid expression of elements of those regions. As so, DNA methylation contributes to the maintenance of genomic integrity by:</p><ul><li>silencing the repeats to prevent transposition and mutating the repeats (meC to T) to prevent transposons</li>
<li><span>silencing the repeats to avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters and prevents illegitimate recombinations. </span></li></ul><p>In <strong>case of cancer</strong>, research shown a complete different picture.</p><p>On one hand, DNA methylation is more likely to be found on CpG islands and CpG islands shores, going up to hypermethylation. This leads to silencing of gene expression, either with formation of dense chromatin, or with prohibition of transcription factor binding. Tumor suppressor genes are then no more expressed in the cells, which contributes to the development of cancer.</p><p>On the other hand, DNA hypomethylation is more likely to be found intergenic regions and repetitive elements. As most of the genome is composed of these regions, this will lead to genomic instability, i.e.:</p><ul><li>chromatin is poorly packaged, which facilitates illegitimate recombination between repeats</li>
<li><span>repeats are activated, contributing to more transposition. </span></li>
</ul><p>










</p><p>In that case, chromosomal instability will contribute to tumorigenesis</p><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Let’s take the example of H19/Igf2 cluster, located on human chromosome 11 to study the disruption of imprinting.</p>
<p>On this specific cluster, we find Igf2 promoter, then H19 ICR, then H19 promoter and finally enhancers. The behavior of paternal and maternal alleles is different.</p><p></p><ul><li><strong>Maternal allele</strong>: H19 ICR is not methylated. CTFC, which  an insulator protein, can bind to ICF. Igf2 is insulated from enhancers, H19 is expressed. So enhancers cannot access to Igf2 to activate it.</li><li><strong>Paternal allele</strong>: H19 ICR is methylated. CTFC cannot bind to it, and methylation spreads to H19 promoter, so it cannot be expressed. Enhancers are free to access Igf2 to activate.</li></ul><p>This activation is performed only on paternal allele, which allows a normal regulation of the Igf2 hormone</p>
<p>In case of <strong>Wilm’s tumour</strong>, DNA methylation of H19 ICRs and promoters is seen on both alleles. CTFC cannot bind to the ICRs, Igf2 is no more insulated from enhancers that can activate it on both alleles. We have here loss of imprinting, which leads to over expression of Igf2. As the major role of Igf2 is to promote growth during gestation, there is up regulation of this hormone and cells can grow tremendously.<br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is due to enzymes DNMT3, and maintained by DNMT1 when DNA replicates. </p><p><strong>EZH2</strong> is a histone methyltransferase, subunit of PRC2 complex, that catalyzes the methylation of H3K27.</p>
<p>In case of <strong>myelodysplastic syndrome</strong> and <strong>acute myeloid leukemia</strong> (2 hematopoietic malignancies), research has shown an <strong>over expression of EZH2</strong>. Over expression of EZH2 means more methylation of H3K27, so means more DNA methylation </p>
<p>Research also shown that DNMT1 is recruited by EZH2, leading to a higher frequency of DNA methylation. And increased levels of DNA methylation are often synonymous of cancer.</p>
<p><strong>Decitabine</strong> is drug which inhibits DNMTP. It is toxic thigh levels, but when targeted at good dosage, it acts on DNA demethylation by sequestrating DNMT1.<br /></p>
<p>It has been shown to decreases the level of EZH2 in blood. Which means at the end more DNA hypomethylation.</p>
<p>This drug has been shown to prolong survival in worst cases of MDS.<br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an inactive epigenetic mark. As so, it is mitotically heritable, meaning that it will be found in daughter cells, and the genes will be expressed (or not expressed) in the same way as it is in parental cells.</p>
<p>The alteration of DNA methylation, when done by drugs like Decitabine, leads to a sequestration of DNMT1. This will be inherited by daughter cells (mitotically heritability)  and so on. At one point in time, the effect will be removed, but it will last after the period of drug treatment.</p>
<p>This is why « epigenetic » drugs have to be used cautiously, especially during sensitive periods.</p>
<p>There are periods of epigenetic reprogramming, also called sensitive periods, during the life of a human:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Early embryonic</strong> period, where paternal and maternal genomes are reset, IAPs not cleared and imprinted genes maintain their parent-of-origin specific marks</li>
<li><strong>Primordial germ cells</strong> development, where where paternal and maternal genomes and imprinted genes are reset, and IAPs not cleared</li>
</ul><p>If we treat patients during these periods, with drugs that inhibit the epigenetic machinery, this could alter some epigenetic marks that will be then transmitted to offspring by passage through the germ cells. </p><div><br /></div></div>
