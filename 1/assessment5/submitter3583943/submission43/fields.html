    <div class="field-value"><br />- The normal fonction of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to silence gene expression. Methylation is associated with the formation of a repressive chromatin structure that prohibits transcriptor factor binding and so alters gene expression The methylated CpG can also bind protein, have a DNA binding domain or a transcriptional repression domain. They can also act in recruiting proteins that condense chromatin.<br /><br />- In cancers, we can find  both hypo and hypermethylation :<br /> <br />Hypomethylation in CpG of CpG poor promotors induces an activation of the associated genes that promote the synthese of tumor growth factors ( increase cell growth). When the hypomethylation becomes genome wide, it induces a loss of genome stability. In contrary, the hypermethylation of locus specific CpG in island shores of tumor suppressor genes silences the genes and since the suppressor genes are silenced, there is no more control of the cell growth. <br /><br /><br />- The normal fonction of DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to maintain the genome integrity, to silence cryptic promotors, translation start sites or cryptic splice sites. The DNA is densely packaged. Silencing repeats prevents transposons to jump around the genome, as well as illegitimate recombinaisons and abnormal karyotypes : deletions, insertions, reciprocal translocations. <br /><br />- during cancer,  there is a genome wide  hypomethylation at repeats  and intergenic regions that leads to a genomic instability.<br />the chromatine is no more densely packaged, what is described above,  prevented there by methylation, happens  : deletions, transposons which jump and can disrupt the coding region of a gene..., loss of genetic material...<br /><br />- transposon jumping, translocations, deletions , opening of the chromatines... can lead to silencing of tumor suppressor genes or transcription of tumor growth factors. They prevent the "normal" control and expression of these genes. <br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In imprinting genes, only one allele is expressed depending of parental origine. Disrupting them induces either no more gene expression or expression of both alleles.<br /><br />sketch of the H19/igf2 cluster :<br /><br />Igf2 gene - ICR (imprinting controle cluster)- H19 gene - Enhancers<br /><br />On paternal chromosome,  ICR and  H19 promoters are methylated. It prevents  CTCF to bind on ICR. The DNA is able to fold, the enhancers have access to Igf2 gene which is expressed, H19 is not.<br /><br />On the maternal chromosome, the non-methylated ICR binds a protein : CTCF. There is no folding possible, the enhancers  have no access to Igf2 and act on H19 promoter. A long non-coding RNA is synthetized.<br /><br />In Wilms tumor, the maternal chromosome has a paternal epigenotype because of the biallelically  ICR methylation : Igf2 is expressed on both chromosomes and  a double dose of Igf2 is secreted. H19 gene is not expressed.<br /><br />When imprinting at the H19/Igf2 clusters is disrupted, a double dose of Igf2, Insuline-like Growth Factor2, is synthetized and increases normal and tumor cell growth. H9 is not expressed and long no-coding RNA is not synthesized.<br />When synthesized, how the long non-coding RNA prevents Wilms tumor is not known. It could prevent the expression of tumor suppressor genes. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the class of the DNA-demethylating agents. They prevent DNA methylation, it is a methyltranferase inhibitor.<br /><br />How it acts :<br />Its action is division dependent, methylation is mitotically inherited during DNA replication. Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue which is incorporated in the DNA during replication. When the DNA methyl transferase comes along to bind the nucleoside in order to then transfer the methyl group to the daughter strand, it  binds in an irreversible way to the analogue nucleoside. And the methyl group can not be added.<br />No methylation is anymore possible for all the cell DNA but since tumor cells divide more quickly than normal cells, they are more severely affected.<br />In tumor cells, an hypermethylation of some promoters can inhibit the synthesis of tumor suppressor factors. The dectabine is used to prevent this hypermethylation and allow the synthesis of tumor suppressor factors.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div><div><div><br /></div></div><div><div>Drugs that alter DNA methylation have effects that last beyond the period of treatment because they prevent the methylation. DNA methylation is mitotically inherited with the "mother" strand used as the "model". If the mother strand is not methylated, the daughter strand will not be methylated and so on.<br /><br />During sensitive periods, germ cell development and early embryonic development,<i> </i>the epigenetic marks are removed and then re-established. To disrupt this methylation induces a complete desorganisation of the genome, abnormal expression of the genes...Treatments during these periods will affect the next generation :</div><div>- at the beginning of the pregnancy, embryonic cells are methylated  during early embryonic development, so pregnancy must be prevented in giving an effective contraceptif to the woman in age of procreate.</div><div>- in children, for girls, oocyte methylation will last from the birth to the puberty. The oocytes remains vulnerable during all the childhood while in boys, the methylation is finished at birth. So treating girls during childhood will have influences.<br />In addition to the two main sensitive periods, each organ has a sensitive period during its development : the brain activelly develops during infancy so it is a sensitive period too, treating children should be avoid. <br /></div></div></div><div><div></div></div></div>
