    <h1>Submission 409 from Anon (session_user_id: 9c64b01c0e7f6c78f64f58924bc4aa69ef02a6fb)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA<span>-demethylating agent (DNMT inhibitor). As a DNMTi, Decitabine is anucleoside analogues, so it gets incorporated into the DNA upon replication. This inhibitor binds i</span>rreversibly <span> to DNMT1, when DNMT1  comes to bind to the nucleoside in order to copy the methylation to the other strand (division-dependent). In consequence, decitabine causes DNA demethylation, but it seems to have other effects.<br />This drug has an anti-neoplasic effect. </span>DNA methylation is an
alternative to genetic mutation, to silence tumour suppressor genes in cancer. Therefore <span>is mitotically heritable and reversible by some drugs like Decitabine.<br /></span><span>Decitabine mechanism of action is division-dependent.
So this means that cancer cells, which are dividing more rapidly than the other
cells in the body, will be more severely affected because they are replicating
more. DNMTi have to be used in low doses, because in high doses they are toxic.</span><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell CpG islands are hypomethylated, and the intergeneic
regions, introns and repetitive elements are hypermethylated. However, in cancer cells CpG islands
are normally hypermethylated, and the intergeneic regions, introns and
repetitive elements are hypomethylated.<br />In CpG islands, this leads to problems, because tumour suppressor genes can become silenced, causing an abnormal cell growth, and grow into a tumour. These epigenetic aberrations are alternatives to genetic mutations in order to start a cancer. Latter regions and repetitive elements are normally hypermethyladted, these is associated with greater genomic stability (transposable elements are silenced). In cancer we find that this regions are normally hypomethylated, this leads to genomic instability: deletions, insertions, translocations, etc.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell around the H19/Igf2,
we normally observe the methylation of the paternal allele at ICR, and no
methylation of the maternal allele. <span>The CTCF protein complex binds to the allele on
the maternal strand (methylation avoids CTCF binding on the paternal allele)
and in consequence the downstream enhancers act on H19. As I have said before, the
CTCF complex does not bind to the paternal allele due to the methyl marks. Therefore H19 is silenced, and the enhancers instead drive the expression of Igf2. In a
normal cell we will observe a normal dose of both H19 and Igf2. But if the ICR
become hypermethylated, both strands appear to be a paternal origin allele and
are expressed like a paternal origin allele. As a result, the system gets no
dose of H19 and a double dose of Igf2. This fact is associated with Wilm’s
tumour.</span></p><b></b></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>DNA
methylation is an interesting form of epigenetic regulation to target in cancer
treatments. It can be manipulated, and enduring effects are ensured because
DNMT enzymes preserve methyl marks during mitosis. However there are sensitive periods: -"</span>A period of development that is susceptible to environmental signals". The epigenome is most vulnerable during periods of extensive epigenetic reprogramming: Germ cell development and early embryonic development (pre-implantation development).<br />If we treat patients during sensitive periods; germ cell development in younger patients and early embryonic pregnant patients. We have to consider the effect on germ cells and stem cells epigenome.<i></i></div>
