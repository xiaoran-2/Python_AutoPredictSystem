    <div class="field-value">Through DNA methylation at CpG islands, it can repair DNA or silence gene expression. Because methylated CpG island can be bound by MeCP proteins which have a DNA binding domain and transcriptional repression domain and can recruit other factors that condense the chromatin. Hence, methylated CpG island can prohibit transcription factor binding and alter gene expression.<br /><br />In normal cells, most CpG islands remain unmethylated status. But cancer cells will accumulate higher levels of DNA methylation. Thus, it will lead to the silencing of tumour suppressor genes then cause aberrant cell cycle control, apoptosis or DNA repair. Hence, the cancer cells will growth abnormally (that is cancer cells will division and growth without control).<br /><br />DNA methylation in intergenic regions can silence cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites. While DNA methylation in repetitive elements can silence those repeats to prevent transposition and avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters. Furthermore, methylation of repeats may also prevent illegitimate recombination. Thus, DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements will maintain the stability of the genome and regulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes. <br /><br />Cancer cells will lead to genome-wide hypomethylation. This can activate transposable elements to transpose then disrupt or activate some DNA intervals to transcript. And it can cause transcriptional interference by activating the strong promoters. Besides, DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements may also cause some illegitimate recombination of chromatin.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine, as a DNA methylation inhibitors, can bind to nucleoside during DNA replication and then methytransferases will bind irreversibly to this Decitabine-bound-nucleoside thus methyltransferases can no longer bind other daughter DNA strands and methylate them. So, with the cell division, DNA methylation levels will be reduced, thus it may decrease the CpG islands' DNA methylation to reactivate the tumour suppressor genes to have an anti-tumour effect.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">On paternal allele, the imprint control region is methylated thus leads to blocking the binding of CTCF. Without CTCF, DNA methylation will spread to the promoter of H19 and silence it. Then the enhancers at the downstream of H19 can access Igf2 cluster and activate it.<br />In contrast, the imprint control region is unmethylated in a maternal allele then the CTCF will bind to this imprint region. As an insulate protein, CTCF will insulate Igf2 from downstream enhancers of H19. Hence, those enhancers won't be able to access Igf2. And, thus, the Igf2 will be silent.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumour, the imprint control region of the maternal allele will be methylated like the paternal allele. So, refer to the descriptions above, Wilm's tumour cells will have a double dose of Igf2 but no H19 is expressed when compare with the normal cells. For the reason that Igf2 can promote cell growth, hence, it will lead to the uncontrolled division and growth of cancer cells.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">For the reason that DNA methylation may have mitotically inheritability, that is they could be passed down to daughter cells and granddaughter cells until they get cleared during cell division, thus <span>altering DNA methylation could have enduring effects on the epigenome beyond the period of drug treatment.<br /><br />A sensitive period means that cells at sensitive period are sensitive to environment changes, that is cells' epigenetic state may have dramatically changes to the environmental changes such as maternal nutrition of gestation.<br /></span><br />Primordial germ cell development period and pre-implantation embryo development period are defined as sensitive periods, these two sensitive periods may be avoided for treating with epigenetic drugs.<br /><br />Because cells are sensitive to the changes of environment at sensitive periods, epigenetic drugs can have a strong effect on those normal cells' epigenetic state then leads to abnormal development of cells and tissues rather than only affect normal cells faint but alter the cancer cells' epigenetic state actively.</div>
