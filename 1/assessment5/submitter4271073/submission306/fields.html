    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>CpG islands of gene promoters are usually hypomethylated. In cancer, CpG islands of gene promoters are progressively hypermethylated, which leads to gene silencing. If the silenced gene was a tumor suppressor gene, then this will contribute to cancer. <br /></li><li>On the other hand, CpG islands of centromeres, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated normally.  In cancer, they become hypomethylated. This leads to increased chromosomal instability, transposons expression and disrupted expression of genes where they reside.<br /></li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>H19 Imprinting control region is located upstream of H19 gene/promoter and is hypermethylated in the paternal chromosome leading to hypermethylation of the neighboring H19 promoter. When active, H19 acts as an insulator that blocks activation of the Igf2 promoter by distal enhancer elements.<b> Thus Igf2 is expressed when H19 is silenced which is what happens in paternal chromosome. </b><br /></li><li>H19 Imprinting control region is hypomethylated in the maternal chromosome. Thereafter, H19 promoter does not get methylated and remains active. H19 acts as an insulator that blocks activation of the Igf2 promoter by distal enhancer elements.<b> Thus Igf2 is silenced when H19 is activated which is what happens in maternal chromosome. </b><br /></li><li><b>In Wilm's tumo</b>r, H19 Imprinting control region is methylated in the Maternal as well as the Paternal chromosome leading to H19 promoter silencing and Igf2 overexpression from both the paternal and maternal chromosome. This is called loss of imprinting and occurs in Wilm's tumor.<br /></li><li><b>In cancer,</b> there is also loss of imprinting in somatic cells thus Igf2 is over expressed due to both maternal and paternal copies being expressed. Igf2 stimulates the growth of cells and prevents cell death leading to cell mortality and cancer<br /></li></ul><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a cytosine analog and belongs to DNA-demethylating agents. It acts as an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase and leads to DNA demethylation which leads to reactivation of epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor gene promoters. This will lead to reactivation of tumor suppressor genes which have an anti tumor effect</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and stable. If is is altered in a cell, the effect will be transmitted to daughter cells through mitosis leading to an enduring effect throughout the life of the organism. A sensitive epigenetic period is a time during development when epigenetic marks and methylation are reset then re-established (epigeneti reprograming occurs). During this process the epigenome is very sensitive to environmental and altering epigenetic elements. In development, sensitive periods occur in two waves: during early embryogenesis after fertilization and before emrbyo implantation, and during primordial cells development. Patients should not be treated during sensitive periods since the epigenome will be very sensitive to environmental factors including medications. This may alter the epigenome and the alteration, permanent, may lead to health problems. </div>
