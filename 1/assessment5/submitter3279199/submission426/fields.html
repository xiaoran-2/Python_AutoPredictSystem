    <h1>Submission 426 from Anon (session_user_id: c6aa51c70cea89e4742e0f8679db570070b40fab)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><b>Decitabine</b><span> <b>acts as a</b><span> <b>DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi)</b>.It
is a nucleotide analogue that integrates the DNA and</span><b> can bind to DNA methyltransfera<b> irreversibly</b></b>,
preventing their function. Consequently, <b>the DNA methyltransferases cannot methylate the </b></span><b>hemimethylated DNA</b><span> during
cell division and<b> </b><b>the
methylation will be diluted</b> at each new cell generation (similar to the
pre-imputation passive maternal epigenetic remodelling). Since </span>Decitabine action reduces the methylation in a
division-dependent manner, this drug is <b>a good candidate as treatment to cancers characterized
by regional hypermethylation</b>. As cancer cells are highly proliferative,
these cells will be more sensitive to Decitabine
and, as Decitabine prevents the methylation of the hemimethylated DNA, the proliferation of the cancer cells
will result in regularization of the epigenetic status of the cells,
effectively reducing the malignancy of the tumour. In such a way, “<i>epigenetic therapies can
effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells</i>.”<br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><b>DNA methylation is normally
absent (hypomethylation) from the CpG islands</b><span>. Since
these CpG islands have an association with gene promoters, this <b>hypomethylation</b><span> is important to maintain a regulatory environment
permissive for gene expression. On the other hand, </span></span><b>repetitive
elements are normally highly methylated (hypermethylated)</b><span>, as
these elements usually correspond to transposons that can duplicate into other
regions of the genome and function as alternative promotors. As such, hypermethylation
of repetitive elements (transposons) is critical for maintaining genomic stability. However,
it is frequent to find these methylation patterns disrupted in cancer. <b>CpG islands </b>(and islands shores)<b> are often hypermethylated </b>while both <b>intergenic regions and repetitive elements</b>
<b>are often hypomethylated in cancer</b>. </span></p><p>

<span>These disruptions may contribute to the cancer phenotype in various
ways.<b> The hypermethylation of CpG
islands</b> <b>will result in gene promoter
silencing</b>. <b>If the gene in question
has a tumour suppressing function, then the silencing of such a gene will contribute
to the deregulation of proliferation and survival</b> characteristic of cancer.
 These are the cases of genes such as RB (retinoblastoma),
MLH1 (colorectal cancer), BRCA1 (breast cancer) and MGMT (glioma and colorectal
cancer</span>). <b>Hypomethylation
of repetitive elements will result in genomic instability</b><span>.
This instability can result from chromosomal misalignment and lead to <b>illegitimate recombination, insertions or deletions</b>
of significant part of the genome, which characterizes some types of cancer. On
the other hand, repetitive elements have promotor activity. Because these
elements can change position in the genome (transposons) abnormal promoter
activity may also <b>deregulate gene expression
by introduction of cryptic promotors</b> (as was the case with the Avy
and Axinfu mice) if the repetitive elements are
hypomethylated. Additionally,<b>
hypomethylation of intergenic CpG poor promotors can result in activation of
tumour promoting genes </b>(oncogenes) such as R-ras (gastric cancer) or miR21
(glioma)<br /><br /></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>During normal
development,<b> the paternal allele of the </b></span><b>H19/Igf2 cluster<span> is imprinted</span></b>. This means that <b>the imprinting control region (ICR)
is methylated</b> in the chromosome inherited from the father. This methylation
of the IRC prevents the binding of the CTCF insulator protein, which insulates
the Igf2 genes from the cluster enhancers. Consequently, the Igf2 gene is
active in the paternal allele. On the other hand, since CTCF is not binding,
the promotor of the H19 long coding RNA is also methylated, silencing its
transcription.<b>  The absence of imprinting on the maternal allele</b>
reverses this situation. With the ICR unmethylated, the CTCF protein can bind
to the DNA and insulate the Igf2 from the cluster enhancers. Consequently, Igf2
will not be expressed from the maternal allele. The methylation of the H19
promotor is prevented and its transcription can occurs. As such, <b>Igf2 is only expressed from the paternal
allele, while H19 is expressed exclusively from the maternal allele</b>. </p><p>

</p><p><span><br /><b>In Wilm's tumour</b>, the imprinting </span>at the H19/Igf2 is disrupted, resulting in h<b>ypermethylation of the maternal allele</b>.
Consequently, both alleles will express Igf2 and none will express H19. This
results in an<b> overexpression of Igf2, a
growth promoting gene (oncogene)</b>, and silencing of H19, a growth suppressor
gene (tumour suppressor), <b>which will
lead to cancer an tumour formation</b>.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><strong>Drugs that alter the DNA methylation can have lasting effects</strong> beyond the period of treatment <strong>as DNA methylation is mitotically inheritable</strong>. This means that once a methylation mark has been altered, it should be passed on during cell division. As mentioned in the Econimist article "<em>Unlike other ... regulation ..., epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division ... until they are actively erased</em>". <br /><br />However, because this methylation alterations can be maintained so long after the treatment, care must be taken so that the drug is not applied during the epigenetic<strong> sensitive periods.</strong> These <strong>are the periods when the epigenome is most sensitive to external (environmental) insults</strong> and thus drug treatments can result in long lasting abnormal epigenetic regulation. The most sensitive periods are <strong>when the large epigenetic remodelling such as erasure of epigenetic markes during pre-implantation development and primordial germ cell differentiation occur</strong>. <strong>Treating patients during sensitive periods</strong> would be inadvisable because the <strong>DNA methylation alterations induced are more likely to disrupt the normal epigenetic regulation</strong>,  which can result in abnormal development and/or cellular proliferation (tumours), specially as some of these  epigenetic abnormalities may be transgenerational inheritable, meaning that further generations may be affected by the drug treatment (e.g. Dutch famine).<br /><br /><p><br /></p></div>
