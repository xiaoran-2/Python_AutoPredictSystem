    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:

    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are are usually found in the promoter regions; so they help regulate the expression of the gene downstream. Silencing (hypermethylation) of these leads to silencing of the gene.In cancer, DNA methylation at the CpG island increases, leading to hypermethylation. Hypermethylation at the CpG islands at the promoter region of a tumor suppressor genes silences the latter, leading to unchecked and uncontrolled cell proliferation.<br />In a normal cell, intergenic region and repetitive elements are silenced by DNA methylation, thereby leading to genomic stability- hypermethylation wounds these elements tightly, preventing any activity, transposition, or recombination.In cancer, however, DNA is hypomethylated or methylation is removed in these regions leading to instability - these hypomethylated repeats can recombine, transpose,and even activate cryptic promoters causing deactivation of tumor suppressor genes- and all these ultimately contribute to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Loss of imprinting serves as one of the causes of cancer; it leads to the loss of expression in growth restricting gene, or over expression of growth promoting gene. An example is Igf2, which is a growth promoting gene and is maternally imprinted. In normal cells, the paternal allele is expressed- there is hypermethylation of the ICR upstream of H19 leading to absence of binding by CTCF. Hence, H19 is silenced, and the enhancers present upstream of H19 causes the expression of Igf2, found upstream of the ICR, However, in maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated- hence, CTCF binds to it to insulate the upstream Igf2. Hence, the enhancers express H19 and Igf2 remains silent.  In Wilms's tumor, the maternal imprint of Ifg2 is lost- the ICR is hypermethylated and hence, CTCF cannot insulate Igf2 and the latter is expressed along with its paternal allele- there is a double dose of this growth promoting factor which leads to the Wilm's tumor in the kidneys. So, disruption of this imprint leads to overexpression of the growth promoting Igf2, contributing to uncontrolled proliferation and thus cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is an azacitidine, and this class of drug is responsible for the hypomethylation of<em> DNMT </em>or DNA Methyltransferases. As we know, one of the main causes of cancer is silencing of the tumor suppressor genes by methylation of their promoter regions. It had been used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome, thereby treating Meyloid lukaemia.  Decitabine serves as demethylating these silenced regions, thereby counteracting the cancer mechanism. This drug is used in conjunction with histone deacetyase inhibitors to treat cancer. Thus, once Decitabine demethylates the silenced regions, the tumor suppressor genes are activated again, and hence uncontrolled cell proliferation is eliminated, restraining the tumor. This erasing of methyation is also inherited mitotically, and so the cell line derived will be free of the cancer causing methylation, thereby proving that Decitabine is has anti-tumor effects.This drug has also been successfully used to treat solid tumors.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The change in the epigenome is mitotically heritable. So, once we change the DNA methylation pattern in a cell, it becomes permanent and is inherited by all the subsequent daughter cells until they are erased permanently. This process of change in DNA methylation pattern occurs naturally during 'Sensitive Period". Sensitive period refers to the time frame in which the entire epigenome's methylation, acetylation and other modifications are erased and re-written. In humans, epigenetic modification i.e. the sensitive period is during primordial germ cell development, and in the inner cell mass. Repeats, however, are not erased. <br />So, if chemotherapy is done on a cancer patient during sensititive period, using enzymes like DNA methyltransferases (<em>DNMT</em>), it will affect the methylation patterns of the entire epigenome. And this will be heritable by all the subsequent cell generation. Hence, it will cause a greater instability of the genome of the patient.</div>
