    <div class="field-value"><div>Studies have shown that alteration in the methylation patterns in a genome can cause cancer. Normally hypomethylation is seen throughout the genome in 60 to 70 % of CpG dinucleotides in somatic and Mammalian cells. In a normal cell no methylation is found at the CpG islands at the promoter  region of a gene irrespective of the activity of the gene. </div><div>DNA methylation at the CpG dinucleotides is associated the with gene silencing. The normal function of CpG methylation therefore plays important role in genomic imprinting, X chromosome inactivation and in formation of heterochromati Disruption in the pattern of methylation in a genome can cause  non tissue specific expression and or at wrong timing during development. Unlike normal hypo methylation pattern throughout genome, hypermethylation is found in the CpG islands of a promoter region of a gene of a cancerous cells. Hypermethylation at the promoter region of a tumor suppressor gene causes the loss of gene activity suppressing normal cell death allowing cell proliferation aiding tumor growth in cancer.</div><div>The function of DNA methylation seen at intergenic regions and at repetitive elements is to maintain genomic integrity as it's found that  Dnmt1 null cells display genomic instability. It maintains stability by silencing cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites. Silencing of repeats to prevents transposition also mutation of the repeats (meC to T) to prevent transposition. The silencing of repeats avoids transcriptional interference from strong promoters.  Finally methylation of repeats may prevent illegitimate recombination. Demethylation at inergenic regions and repetitive elements causes disruptive patterns of genes expression, by expression of cryptic transcription start and spice sites and or illegimate recombination increasing overall genomic instability and aiding cancer.<br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;

    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><div>ICR on a long coding RNA (H19)/and Insulin like growth factor 2(Igf2) clusters is unmethylated in a maternal allele . Long non coding RNA H19 is produced just from maternal allelle. This unmethylated ICR region in maternal allele is bound by a protein called CTCF, it is an insulator protein, it insulates the Igf2 from binding of downstream enhancers, so enhancers are now free to bind to H19 region increasing its expression and Igf2 gene is not expressed.</div><div>ICR of H19/Igf2 clusters is methylated in paternal allele, paternally imprinted.  Long non coding RNA H19 is  not produced from paternal  allele, This methylated ICR blocks binding of CTCF, </div><div>This allows the enhancers to bind to Igf2 region resulting in expression of Igf2.The H19 is no longer active because the DNA methylation spreading  toH19 promoter</div><div>In  'Wilms' tumor the Loss of Imprinting LOI occurs which causes the maternal chromosome reverses to a paternal epigenotype, with a paternal pattern of methylation of the H19 promoter, IGF2 turned on, and H19 turned off, causing increased cell growth. LOI of H19 on the maternal chromosome, when it occurs, could occur independently or could be influenced by events in the paternal chromosome</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>  Decitabine is a member of drugs called DNA Demethylating agents. Methylation of DNA regulates gene expression in cells.   DNA methylation  can result in the blockage of the activity of "suppressor genes" that regulate cell division and growth.  When suppressor genes are blocked, cell division becomes unregulated, allowing or promoting cancer.  Decitabine's anticancer effects are believed to be twofold.   One way that it works is by demethylation or interfering with the methylation of DNA.  By this process of demethylation, normal function to the tumor suppressor genes is restored, thus it restores the control over cell growth. Decitabine also belongs to the category of chemotherapy called antimetabolites.  Antimetabolites are very similar to normal substances within the cell.  When the cells incorporate these substances into the cellular metabolism, they interact with a number of targets within the cell to produce a direct cytotoxic effect that causes death of rapidly dividing cancer cells.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><br /><div>According to the economist article study by Stephen Baylin at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, in Baltimore, showed that a combination of a histone-deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine slowed tumour growth in some people with advanced lung cancer. Intrestingly Participants in Dr Baylin's study who did not show much response to the trial itself had  shown an unexpectedly good reaction to the routine chemotherapeutic drugs which were used on them next. This led Dr Baylin speculate that his epigenetic drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy.The germ cell development and early embryonic development are the sesitive periods of Devlopment. The sensitive periods are the periods when genomic reprogramming a occurs. So the alteration in methylation pattern that is ,the  epigenetic changes, are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. They do not return once changes are erased.   Treating patients during this sensitive period with drugs that alter mythlyation pattern can cause alteration in normal cell development that can passed on to another generation.<br /><br /></div><br /></div>
