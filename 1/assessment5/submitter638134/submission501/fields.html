    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is altered in cancer by becoming hypo or
hypermethylated. CpG islands tend to be unmethylated, but in cancer CpG islands
and CpG island shores become methylated contributing to disease by silencing
tumour suppressor genes. In normal cells, the intergenic regions and repetitive
elements tend to be methylated providing genomic stability. In cancer cells,
the intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be hypomethylated
resulting in genomic instability which causes illegitimate recombination
between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, and activation of
cryptic promoters and disruptions to neighbouring genes. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruptions
of imprinting in the ICR can cause monoallelic parent of origin specific
expression to become expressed or silent from both alleles. In regard to the
H19/Igf2 cluster on the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated allowing
enhancers to act on Igf2. On the maternal allele, it is unmethylated and binds the
CTCF insulator element allowing enhancers to act on H19, but silencing Igf2. In
Wilm’s tumour, there is hypermethylation of the ICR and both alleles become
methylated which expresses a double dose of Igf2. Igf2 is growth promoting and
overexpression can result in tumours.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent used to interfere
with overactivity. It decreases hypermethylation. It can
have an anti-tumour effect by allowing tumour-suppressor genes to become active
again.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>It is possible that drugs that alter DNA methylation can
have an effect that lasts beyond the period of treatment because epigenetic
marks can be mitotically heritable (passed on during cell division) until they are actively erased. Sensitive periods are times in which epigenetic
marks are established. These include the blastocyst stage and development of
primordial germ cells during embryogenesis/gametogenesis.  During these periods, it would be
inadvisable to introduce any drug that interferes with or alters the epigenetic
marks that are being established because we have no way of knowing what the
effect would be on the primordial germ cells.</p>
