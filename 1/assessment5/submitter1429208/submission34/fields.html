    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cytosine
followed by Guanine is the site of DNA methylation in the normal
genome.  These dinucleotides tend to cluster (called CpG islands)
near the promotors of genes and are usually not methylated.   
Methylation, if it occurs, is associated with gene silencing.<br /></p>

<p></p>
<p>In
cancer, the CpG islands are methylated and the methylation spreads to
nearby CG pairs not in the cluster itself, especially near the
promotors of Tumor Supressor genes and Imprint Control Centers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This
methylation is mitotically heritable, so the Tumor Supressor genes
are kept inactive allowing the cell to reproduce freely and
outcompete the normal cells in the tissue.<br /></p>

<p>In
contrast, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally
methylated which aids genomic stability.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In
cancer, these become methylated, disrupting stability and allowing
inappropiate recombinations.</p>
<p><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> <span>Many
	imprinted genes are involved in growth. At the H19/Igf2 cluster, the
	paternal allele is normally methylated which prevents the binding of
	CTCF, allowing enhancers to act on Igf2, while the unmethlated
	imprint control region on the maternal allele allows the enhancers
	to act on the H19 while their access to Igf2 is blocked by CTCF.     When this imprinting is disrupted in cancer,
	the maternal allele is also methylated so that Igf2 is produced from
	both alleles and this double dose  of a growth promoting gene leads
	to Wilm's tumor.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine
is a DNA demethylating agent (DNMT inhibitor) which is on the market
used to treat myelodysplastic
syndromes which untreated can progress to acute myelogenous
leukaemia, a blood cancer.  It prevents the transfer of the methyl
group to the daughter cells during mitosis and since cancer cells
replicate more often, dilutes the methylation on the cancer cells
disproportionately.</span></p>
<p><span>Another
DNA demethylating  drug, azacitidine has been used in combination
with a histone-deacetylase inhibitor in the treatment of advanced
lung cancer, with some success by Stephen Baylin at Johns Hopkins
School of Medicine, in Baltimore.  This is the first time epigenetic
drugs have been used with some success to treat solid tumors.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Epigenetic
factors which alter DNA methylation are usually mitotically
inheritable until they are actively removed, so can have lasting
effects beyond the period of drug treatment.  This may explain why Dr
Stephen Baylin found that even among those patients whose tumors did
not shrink after treatment, their tumors did respond better to
subsequent chemotherapy.  </span></p><p><span><br /></span></p><p><span>
However, in using epigenetic drugs, care must be taken with the
'sensitive periods' of epigenome reprogramming during early
embriogenesis and germ cell development.  These drugs are, at least
potentially, likely to act in all cell types with, perhaps, far reaching results.</span></p>
