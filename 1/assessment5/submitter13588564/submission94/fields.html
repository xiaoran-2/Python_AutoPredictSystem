    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG island
methylation is an epigenetic mark associated with gene silencing. As cancer
starts, certain methylation patterns start to change in the organism, especially in gene
promoters. Global methylation decreases in cells as cancer progresses but specific CpG island
methylation increases drastically in the last stages of metastatic cancer.  This CpG methylation affects a series of
genes like cancer suppressor genes who´s silencing contributes to the
maintenance and spreading of the tumor.</p>

<p>In a normal
cell, what we see is a global hypermethylation in intergenic regions and
repetitive elements (even in the introns of genes), and a locus specific
hypomethylation in CpG islands. As cancer progresses, these two characteristics
are gradually swapped, ending up with a hypomethylation in intergenic regions
and repetitive elements alongside hypermethylation in specific CpG islands.</p>

<p>The
hypomethylation of repetitive elements and intergenic regions brings upon
illegitimate recombinations between chromosome parts that have large tracks
that are very similar, aside from this, mutations like deletions and insertions
are common and contribute to the genomic instability caused by cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine or Dacogen is a drug that uses an
epigenetic approach to fight cancer. It is used as a treatment for
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) which generally leads to myelogenous leukaemia. This molecule is a
cytosine analogue and a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor that stops these DNMTs
from methylating cytosine residues in newly synthesized DNA. When the new
strand needs to be methylated with the DNMTs, the DNMT binds irreversibly to
the Decitabine and will no longer be released. This is why the action of the
DNMTi is only effective if the cell is actively replicating. Cancer cells
thrive and replicate constantly and so, the DNMTi will be especially effective
in tumors.</p>

<p><span>By inhibiting the direct activity of DNA methyltransferases,
tumor cells will be unable to methylate the daughter cells´ DNA and so, the
tumors spreading can be controlled. This hypomethylation can eventually lead to
the reactivation of tumor suppressor genes.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic
marks like DNA methylation are mitotically heritable, so epigenetic treatments
will last beyond the period of drug treatment and will pass on to the daughter
cells. But the administration of these substances must be patient-specific, e.g.
children shouldn’t be treated as adults.</p>

<p>Children
and pregnant women should be treated differently because they might be going
through a so called “sensitive period”. A sensitive
period is defined as a time in which the organism´s epigenome is more likely to be
influenced through the environment.</p>

<p>There are
basically two sensitive periods for epigenetic reprogramming: the early
development of the fetus and the Primordial germ cell development. These two
periods are crucial in the laying down of epigenetic marks that will not only
affect the treated patient but possibly his descendants as well. This is why during
this time, patients shouldn´t be treated with drugs that alter the behavior of
epigenetic regulators.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of
imprinting can contribute to cancer and a good example of this is the change
seen in gene clusters for specific cluster methylation alterations can indicate
that cancer could be developing. </p>

<p>One example of
this is the Igf2/H19 cluster. In normal cells, the paternal allele´s imprint
control region (ICR) is methylated and so, this cluster only expresses Igf2.
The maternal allele´s ICR on the other hand is unmethylated which recruits a
binding protein called CTCF. CTCF acts as a shield, preventing the direct
action of neighbouring enhancers on the Igf2 gene. The enhancing activity is
then focused on a gene called H19 and so, the maternal allele only expresses
H19 from the cluster.</p>

<p>In Wilm´s tumor
(an infant kidney tumor), the maternal allele´s ICR of the Igf2/H19 cluster is
methylated (just like the paternal allele) and so, both alleles express Igf2
and neither of them express H19.</p>

<p><span>This doubles the
production of Igf2 in the affected patient. Igf2 is a growth promoter and thus helps
the development of tumors.</span></p></div>
