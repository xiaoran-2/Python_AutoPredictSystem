    <div class="field-value">CpG sites are DNA regions where a cytosine residue is followed by a guanine residue. In mammals, DNA methylation is almost exclusive at CpG dinucleotides, laid down by methyltransferases. These CpG sites are clustered to form CpG islands usually in gene promoters. These islands tend to be protected from methylation, but if a CpG island is methylated, gene silencing occurs since it is associated with a repressive chromatin structure. Gene silencing after CpG islands methylation can also be due to the transcription factors not being able to bind, altering gene expression. In cancer, methylation in CpG islands tends to be denser or hypermethylated. It is generally found in the promotors of tumour supressor genes. Therefore, if tumour supressor genes are silenced by hypermethylation of its promotor, tumours will be favoured since the "controlling unit" is no longer suppressing tumour genes.<br /><br />The function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to maintain genomic integrity, so no chromossome is gained or lost. This happens by silencing cryptic transcription start sites or by silencing the repeats avoiding transposition, for example. So if DNA methylation is disrupted in these sites, integrity is not maintained. In cancer, both these regions are generally hypomethylated. It can result in improper recombination between repeats or activation of repeats and transposition. It can also activate neighbour genes leading to transcription aberration in the surrounding regions.<br /><br />So, depleting Dnmt1 can have different effects, enhancing or suppressing tumorigenesis. Therefore DNA methylation has a context dependent function. Some tumours are driven by tumour supressor hypermethylation or by chromossomal instability where the absence of DNA methylation seems to conduct to tumorigenesis.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the H19/Igf2 cluster, the imprinted control region (ICR) is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele, thus, its paternal imprinted. The long non-coding RNA H19 is only produced in the maternal allele and it's a reservoir for small RNA. When ICR is unmethylated (as in the maternal allele), CTCF (insulator protein) binds to it and insulates the Igf2 gene in this allele. Therefore not allowing the enhancers to bind on Igf2 and acting on H19. In the paternal allele, CTCF cannot bind since ICR is methylated, so there's no insulators action and therefore, the enhancers are free to act on Igf2, that's expressed. In this allele, DNA methylation on ICR also spreads onto H19 which becomes silenced.<br />In Wilm's tumour there's a loss of imprinting of the H19/Igf2 cluster. The maternal allele shows the methylation pattern of the normal paternal allele (with the H19 promotor methylated, Igf2 being expressed and H19 turned off). These alterations of methylation patterns conducts to the increase of cell growth, resulting ultimately in cancer. Disrupting the imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributed to cancer since Igf2 is a oncogene, it promotes growth; when not regulated, increasing growth leads to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine, or 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, is a cytidine analog. It is a hypomethylating agent, so it hypomethylates DNA by binding to DNA methyltransferases. This binding ultimately causes citotoxicity in abnormal cells leading to cell death. Decitabine is incorporated into DNA strands since it can substitute cytosine. When this happens, DNA methyltranferases remain covalently bound to DNA and it function is blocked. Therefore, the transport of methyl groups to the DNA is stopped and the DNA becomes hypomethylated. With the presence of this drug, the methylation marks becomes lost during DNA replication, thus leading to an anti-tumor effect. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effect on the epigenome mainly if this alteration happens during the sensitive periods. Sensitive periods comprise the moments when genomes are undergoing an epigenetic reprogramming such as the pre-implantation period and primordial germ cell development period. In these phases, several alterations occur. The imprinted X chromossome as to become inactive and the somatic marks have to be removed. Methylation and histone acetylation marks are also reprogrammed. Several enzymes like DNA methyltransferases are highly active during these periods. If drugs that alter DNA methylation are administered to patients during these periods, the epigenetic reprogramming can be disrupted and the epigenetic marks that are laid down in the presence of the drugs might not be the correct ones to configure imprinted genes, for instances. Since methylation and unmethylation are important processes during epigenetic reprogramming, disrupting them by administering drugs that alter DNA methylation might lead to malformations or cancer.</div>
