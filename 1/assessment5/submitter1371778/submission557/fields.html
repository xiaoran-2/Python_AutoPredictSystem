            <p>
DNA methylation does not normally occur at CpG islands.  CpG islands are usually associated with promoters for upstream genes.  In cancer, CpG islands become hypermethylated and result in the silencing of genes.  Genes in particular that may be silenced are tumor suppressor genes. Typically intergenic regions are methylated.  These regions may contain repetitive elements which may transpose themselves at multiple locations within the genome and possibly within genes disrupting them.  In normal cells,these regions are methylated thereby silencing these regions.  However in cancer,<span>these regions become hypomethylated and transpositions can occur leading to genomic stability, the hallmark of cancer.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes which are precursors of acute myelogenous leukemia.  Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent.  Cancer shows widespread hypomethylation but hypermethylation of CpG islands (gene promoter regions).  Methylation of these promoter regions can result in silencing of tumor suppressor genes.  Therefore, action by Decitabine can demethylate these promoter regions allowing expression of tumor suppressor genes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark that is mitotically heritable.  Daughter cells will carry those methylation markes forward on subsequent divisions.  Sensitive periods are those where the genome undergoes reprogramming of epigenetic marks (marks are erased and then reset down).  These periods occur in early embryonic development and during primordial germ cell development.  Treatment during these times is unadvisable because germ cells could be altered during the reprogramming period causing epigenetic defects and possibly making cells unviable..</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>
            <p>
In the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated which prevents binding of CTCF.  This allows Igf2 to access the enhancers and be expressed.  The methylation of the ICR extends to the H19 promoter thus silencing H19.  In the maternal allele, CTCF binds to the ICR, thus blocking Igf2.  H19 promoter has access to the enhancers and H19 is expressed.  In Wilm’s tumor, loss of imprinting occurs and the maternal allele acts like the paternal allele; methylation blocks ICR and the H19 promoter.  Therefore, there is an upregulation of Igf2 (growth-promoting) and loss of expression of H19 gene<span>.  Upregulating of Igf2 results in overgrowth of the cell (cancer).</span></p>
