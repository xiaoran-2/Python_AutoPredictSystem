    <div class="field-value">The DNA methylation is one of the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation. Normally DNA methylation occurs at CpG islands and its functions include  gene silencing, X chromosome inactivation, silencing of  transposons, genomic imprinting, maintaining the hetero chromatin structure [reviewed in 1]. In many genes the CpG present at the promoter sites are not methylated, however in cancer cells  the CpG islands becomes hypermethylated which causes the silencing of the underlying gene[2]. The uncontrolled silencing of genes also affects tumour suppressing genes [1]. The hypomethylation of repetitive elements such as transposons and intergenic regions in cancer is also associated with chromosome instability and loss of imprinting [1]. <br /><br /><br /><br /><div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the paternal allele the Igf2 is active, while in the maternal allele it is not. This is because there is an Imprint Control Region (ICR) which is differentially methylated, being methylated in the paternal allele but not in the maternal. In the maternal allele this region recruits CTCF which inactivate Igf2 by forming a chromatin insulator  that blocks enhancers from activating it, however this region is methylated in the paternal allele blocking the binding by CTCF and allowing the enhancers to activate Igf2[1]. <br />In Wilm's tumour Igf2 is overexpressed, because there is loss of imprinting leading to the expression of the maternal allele, causing the Igf2 to be expressed by both alleles. The overdose of Igf2  in mature nephroblasts leads to a failure of proliferation arrest, and the development of perilobar nephrogenic rest (PLNR)-like tumors at
                     the periphery of the renal lobe [2].

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is an hypomethylating agent. Some tumours have hypermethylation leading to uncontrolled gene silencing, by using Decitabine at optimal concentrations it can inhibit the methylation processes and may even reverse some kind of tumours [1]. As cancer cells replicate much faster than normal cells and the epigenetic marks are mitotically transferred, the drug is incorporated faster by them and may stop the increasing methylation that may lead to a series of genomic disorders and instability. <br /><br /><div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable, in a way that leads to lasting effects for the cells that had their methylation patters altered. However to change the marks the cell must be in a sensitive period, this occurs when there is the reprogramming of marks, which is in pluripotent cells, the formation of the gametes and may happen when the cell is dividing or differentiating. <br />Patients during sensitive periods may suffer from aberrations in the normal methylation patterns which can lead to the development of unusual symptoms and the failure of normal cell growth. <br /><br /></div>
