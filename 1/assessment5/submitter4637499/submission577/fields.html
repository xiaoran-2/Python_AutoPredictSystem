    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to suppress gene expression.  In cancer the DNA methylation of the CpG islands of the tumor suppressors genes (that hold back tumor growth) are hypermenthalated (added) so that the genes are inactivated and the CpG islands of the oncogenes (that promote cell growth) are hypormenthalated (removed) so that the genes are activated.  The net result can result in increased tumor growth and decreased tumor restriction that can contribute to cancer.  The normal function of DNA <span>methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to maintain genomic integrity, silence repeats, in order to avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters, and prevent illegitimate recombination.  In cancer, the normally </span> hypermenthalation is removed and the area becomes hypomethylated.  This hypomnetholation can contribute to dance by allowing these areas to be improperly expressed and recombination to occur that can disrupt the genomic integrity.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA-demethylating agents that are used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukemia.  The impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation is to inhibit the activity of enzymes that attach methyl groups to histone proteins. Decitabine can have an anti-tumor effect because a number of  cancers of the immune system are caused by mutations that make these enzymes overactive. Such overactivity methylates histones more than they should be and thus silences the genes they surround, including tumor suppressor genes whose job is to stop the uncontrolled cell growth that causes cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, and an example of this is In the case of Wilm's tumor where there is a disruption in imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster.  In normal cells, for the paternal allele, IGF2 is expressed, H19 is not, and there are several sites upstream of H19 that are methylated.  For the maternal allele IGF2 is not expressed, H19 is expressed, and those same sites upstream are unmethylated.  The imprinting at this cluster is disrupted as follows: the maternal chromosome reverses to a paternal epigenotype, with a paternal pattern of methylation at the sites mentioned above.  As a result, IGF2 is turned on, and H19 turned off.  The net out of this is that on both alleles, IGF2 is now expressed which causes increased cell growth which contributes to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome in two ways: during meiosis and mitosis.  In mitosis, when a cell divides, DNA methylation is passed on to the daughter cells providing an enduring effect on the epigenome.  In meiosis, when the germ cells are created, it is believed that DNA methylation can be passed on to the next generation.  A sensitive period is one in which the body has heightened sensitivity to environmental influences.  Two examples of sensitive periods of development are during pregnancy, especially during embroyogenesis, and for food supply in “slow growth periods”: 9-12 years in grandfathers, 8-10 years in grandmothers, and fetal/ infant life for grandmothers.  Treating patients during sensitive periods such as these would be inadvisable since altering DNA methylation during these periods could have lasting negative effects on the person due to the sensitivity of the epigemone at that time.</div></div>
