    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value">In CpG islands, DNA is normally hypomethylated, whereas in introns, intergenic regions and repetitive elements DNA tends to be hypermethylated. In cancer cells, globally, the oposite occurs. At CpG islands, deregulation of DNA methylation can supress the expression of tumour supressor genes (CpG islands are often found at promoters of tumour supressor genes). In intergenic regions and repetitive elements, DNA methylation is associated with genomic stability. It prevents genomic abnormalities such as translocations, insertions and deletions. In cancer, these areas are hypomethylated and therefore accessible to mutagenics. Furthermore, chromosomes can pair and bring up the abnormalities. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the paternal allele, the Imprinting Control Region (ICR) is normally methylated, what prevents CTCF binding in this region. If CTCF is not bound to the ICR, distal enhancers can access the Igf2 gene and leads to its transcription. The promoter of H19 gene is methylated in the paternal allele and is not expressed. In the maternal allele, the ICR is not methylated and CTCF is able to bind. CTCF inhibts distal enhancers binding to Igf2 promoter and allow the binding to  H19 promoter. So, in the paternal allele Igf2 gene is expressed, while in the maternal allele H19 is expressed. In the Wilm's tumour is observed loss of the H19/Igf2 imprinted expression pattern. The H19 locus is methylated in both alleles, which means that H19 is not expressed while Igf2 is. Double expression of Igf2 accelerates cell division, whereas no expression of H19 assures that no inhibition to the cell division will happen.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine inhibits DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), it is therefore a DNMTi.  Decitabine is a cytidine analog and once DNMT1 is bound to DNA, it can't be released. The daughter strand will not be methylated. It means that Decitabine acts diluting DNA methylation levels. By inhibiting DNA methylation, Decitabine can restore the expression level of a particular site. Some genes which act as metastasis inhibtors, such as CDH1, tend to be hypermethylated in cancer. This means that Decitabine corrects the mistakes made, restoring the methylation pattern of a particular locus.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically inherited. This fact explains why altering DNA methylation can cause long lasting changes on the epigenome. Once the methylation pattern is altered in one place, the daughter cells will show the same pattern of the mother cell. Sensitive period is the period when the epigenetic marks are erased and rewrited. These periods are the period before blastocist (pre-implatation) and germ cell development.  Treating patients in these periods would be inadvisable because the disruption caused in the epigenetic machinery will alter the pattern of distribution of the epigenetic marks and, therefore, alter the expression of several genes.</div>
