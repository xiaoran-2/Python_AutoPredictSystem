    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic marks are the means by which the cell regulates
the transcription of DNA sequences by restricting access of the molecular
machinery of transcription to the DNA strands. Methylation CpG dinucleotides repress
transcription of DNA by binding specific proteins which condense chromatin and
prevent transcription factors from attaching.</p>

<p>CpG dinucleotides are relatively uncommon in the human
genome.  In normal mature somatic cells the
majority of CpG dinucleotides exist in a methylated state in intergenic, transposable
and repetitive elements, which protects these regions from being transcribed. An
important exception to this is the presence of CpG “islands,” consisting of
short sequences of DNA with high levels of CpG dinucleotides, generally
associated with promoters of actively transcribed genes. In normal somatic
cells CpG islands are unmethylated, and transcription of the nearby gene
promoters is not impeded. </p>

<p>In cancer, the global pattern of DNA methylation is
distinctly altered. Across the genome, CpG dinucleotides within intergenic
regions, transposable and repetitive elements are seen to be less frequently
methylated, and available for transcription. When transcribed, intergenic and
repetitive elements can activate cryptic splice sites, can replicate themselves
and disrupt normal genes by transposition, and can activate cryptic promoters.
The “open” chromatin of unmethylated DNA can also participate in chromosome
recombination which may result in unbalanced chromosome translocation,
inversion, deletion, insertion, and changes in ploidy level. </p>

<p>At CpG islands, however, the normal unmethylated state is
reversed, and the methylated CpG islands silence the nearby gene promoters.
This may result in loss of tumor suppressor gene activity, which promotes the formation
of cancer. Cancer is generally acknowledged to result from the accumulation of
multiple insults to the genome. Hypomethylation of intergenic and repetitive
regions, and hypermethylation of CpG islands contribute to the process of
genomic damage seen in cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 gene cluster is an example of how the
disruption of the precise balance of imprinted maternal and paternal genes may
result in tumor formation.  The Igf2 gene
codes for a growth hormone which is active in embryonic and fetal development.
The expression of Igf2 may be inhibited by expression of the nearby gene H19,
and the formation of CTCF protein, which blocks expression of Igf2 from
downstream enhancers. </p>

<p>Under normal circumstances, the H19 gene is methylated in
the paternal allele. CTCF blocking protein does not form, and enhancer
molecules promote the expression of the growth hormone gene Igf2. The maternal
allele H19 is not methylated, and therefore creates the CTCF blocking protein.
Igf2 transcription is prohibited on the maternally derived allele. </p>

<p>When hyper- or hypo-methylation occurs within an ICR, the
balance between paternal and maternal imprinted genes is disrupted. If
hypermethylation occurs in both paternal and maternal H19 gene regions, there
is no mediating influence of the CTCF blocking protein, and Igf2 is expressed
in a double dose. This overexpression leads to the childhood kidney disease
known as Wilm’s Tumor.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes associated with all types of cancer are
global hypomethylation and hypermethylation that is confined to CpG islands
associated with tumor suppressor gene promoters. Success in treating
Myelodysplastic Syndrome and Acute Myeloid Leukemia has been achieved by
treating affected patients with a class of drugs that reduces overall DNA methylation
levels, and thus reducing hypermethylation of CpG islands. One such drug is
Decitabine, a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor. Decitabine is an analog
of cytosine, and is incorporated into the DNA strand during replication. Within
the DNA strand, Decitabine binds irreversibly to DNMT molecules. Under normal
circumstances, DNMTs replicate methylation of CpG dinucleotides from one
daughter strand to another. Decitabine prevents inheritance of methylation
between daughter strands, erasing the epigenetic mark. When methylation within the
CpG island of a tumor suppressor gene promoter is erased, that gene will regain
and maintain activity unless actively re-methylated.  </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The human genome is enormous, and its complexity is
profoundly increased by the number and variety of epigenetic marks that govern
its transcription.  When drugs are
administered that indiscriminately alter the DNA methylation patterns across
the genome, the precise effects of those drugs cannot be entirely known.
Long-term effects of any epigenetic change are too complex to predict. In the
case of cancer, the risk of potential epigenetic-related damage may be offset
by the benefit of short-term cure, especially for a mature adult.  At the blastocyst stage of embryonic
development, the genome exists at a global low of epigenetic markings, with
totipotency of cells established. As the embryo develops, cellular
differentiation is driven by epigenetic changes. Exogenous alteration of DNA
methylation at any stage of embryonic development would probably be disastrous.
During the period of primordial germ cell development before and after birth, epigenetic
marks are also erased and reprogrammed. Treatment with drugs that altered DNA
methylation levels would have consequences that could not be assessed until the
next generation.  Because DNA methylation
is durable and heritable between daughter cells, deliberate alteration of DNA
methylation patterns should not take place during these sensitive periods.</p>
