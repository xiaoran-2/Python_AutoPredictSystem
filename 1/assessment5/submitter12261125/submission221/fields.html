    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation alterations are one of the most observed and widely studied epimutations in Cancer. They are also been established as useful focus of Cancer research as their role in diagnosis and Cancer therapy is significant. During carcinogenesis, there is a general pattern of hypermethylation at particular CpG sites and/or hypomethylation found throughout the genome (targeting intergenic repeats and Oncogenes).<br /><br />In normal state, CpG Islands(CGIs)found near promoters, are generally unmethylated/hypomethylated since methylation at these sites leads to silencing of the nearby gene. In the process of Tumorigenesis, there are hypermethylation events targeting the promoters of tumor suppressors. This removes their control over cell proliferation, apoptosis and other tumor suppressing events aiding malignant growth. Further, Genome wide studies have revealed that hypermethylation of Tumor suppressors are specific for each tumor type and the level of methylation increases with the progression of tumor. Discovering hypermethylated CGIs specific to cancer types can be utilized as potential biomarkers that will aid in the diagnosis, prognosis and targeting the tumor with chemotherapeutic drugs. <br /><br />Hypomethylation events in Cancer have been observed at intergenic regions and in CpG poor promoters. Intergenic regions, composed of repetitive elements, when hypomethylated results in Genomic Instability(GI). This leads to either recombination events like translocation, deletions or insertions in regions which should remain heterochromatinised as in normal cells or activating the transposons resulting in gene expansion. Secondly, Hypomethylation at CpG poor promoters of oncogenes leads to their activation resulting in overexpression of their proteins which aid malignant growth. Examples of this oncogenic activation include RAS(Oncogene) activation seen in gastric cancer and expression of a miRNA which inactivates pTEN, a tumor suppressor. <br /><br />Thus DNA methylation alterations seen in Cancer are primary epimutations that appear to be tumor specific and stage dependent. Exploiting these appears to be an effective way of aiding early detection and treatment of Cancer.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Alterations to Imprint Control Regions(ICRs) have been observed in cancer which results in increased or null expression of the genes controlled by them. Depending on the ICR, hyper/hypomethylation has been detected either leading to loss/amplified gene expression of the Imprinted genes.<br /><br />H19/Igf2 cluster, encoding genes for a lncRNA H19 and a Igf2 protein is controlled by a ICR found in between them. The methylation at ICR of the paternal copy doesn't allow binding of insulator CTCF to it and also silences the nearby promoter of the lncRNA H19. This enables the enhancers to activate the Igf2 gene leading to its expression. In the maternal copy, the unmethylated ICR is free to bind to the insulator which blocks the enhancers from accessing Igf2; the enhancers instead activate the H19 lncRNA expression. This balance of paternally imprinted control is lost in cancer by hypermethylation of ICR in the maternal copy; thus Igf2 is expressed from both maternal and paternal alleles. Increased expression of Igf2 leads to excessive cell proliferation and loss of apoptotic control in neoplastic cells. This form of imprinting loss by hypermethylation has been found in various tumors including the cancer of the kidney, Wilm's tumor. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic machinery, especially DNA methylation changes, that goes awry in tumorigenesis has been the studied in detail. Among the four enzymatic epigenetic regulators approved by the FDA, two of them are DNA Methyl Transferase inhibitors: Vidaza and Decitabine. These are prescribed for the treatment for Myeloid Dysplastic Syndrome and Myeloid Leukemia.<br /><br />Demethylating drugs demethylate hypermethylated CpG promoters near Tumor Suppressor genes thus reactivating them. Decitabine, an analogue of cytosine, gets incorporated into the DNA while the cell divides. This mechanism of action hence targets Cancer cells which divide at a faster rate and are affected more when compared to normal cells. When DNA Methyl Transferase binds to the analogue to methylate it, it gets irreversibly bound and thus inactivated. Apart from blocking DNMT's methylation events, this DNA-enzyme complex triggers DNA damage response resulting in degradation of cellular DNMTs and loss of the methylation marks on the genes. Thus reversal of deactivation of Tumor suppressors can lead to control over tumor growth and metastasis in MDS.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic inhibitors are being recognized for their potential to revert the abnormal epigenetic marks which can eventually regulate malignant growth. Since epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable, destroying the abnormal ones in fast dividing cancer cells will erase those marks in their progeny, thus extending the effects even after the drug exposure is over. Further, Studies have shown that targeting cancer cells with epigenetic drugs makes them less resistant to chemotherapeutic drug action(<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168365914007482" title="Link: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168365914007482">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168365914007482</a>)<br /><br />While epigenetic small molecule inhibitors open up an exciting arena of therapy, it should be noted that they target epigenetic machinery of all actively dividing cells. Administering them to terminally ill cancer patients has various advantages,but it might be dangerous to administer these drugs to young patients in their sensitive periods of development. During these periods, epigenetic reprogramming occurs after erasure of parental epigenetic marks. This happens during early development and Primordial Germ Cell(PGCs) development periods of the fetus, and also when Stem cells are differentiating into functionary cells. While older patients maybe less susceptible to the side effects of these epigenetic inhibitors, young patients with actively dividing stem cells and germ cells will be more prone. Exposing them to epigenetic inhibitors will disrupt the epigenetic machinery which is required for reading, recognizing and establishing epigenetic marks that would ensure proper functioning of cells.</div>
