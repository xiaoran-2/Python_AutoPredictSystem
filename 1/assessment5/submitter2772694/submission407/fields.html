    <div class="field-value"><p><span>In mammals, methyl groups can be covalently
added to the cytosine residues of CpG dinucleotides. This is known as DNA
methylation and is mitotically heritable. In normal tissues, most of the CpGs
are methylated for the exception of those areas where CpGs are found at a high
density. These areas are known as CpG islands and are normally hypomethylated.
In cancer cells a reversal of this scenario is found to have occurred, i.e. CpG
islands are found hypermethylated, but otherwise there is genome-wide
hypomethylation. The more advanced the cancer stage, the more this reversal is
pronounced.  <br />
CpG islands occur in about 60% of gene promotor regions including those of
tumour suppressor genes. Hypermethylation of these regions results in the
silencing of the respective genes. Cells which have lost tumour suppression
ability in this way tend to resist DNA damage without undergoing apoptosis and
also tend to acquire further Hallmarks of cancer. Thus these cells have a
proliferative advantage over nearby cells and will on time out-compete them. <br />
About two-thirds of the human genome is known to consist of repetitive DNA
elements, the vast majority of which are transposable elements (TEs).
Protein-expressing genes are interspersed and surrounded by these repetitive
DNA elements. TEs have the ability to excise and insert at random throughout
the genome and therefore have a high potential for causing mutations. During
excision, TEs can cause: (i) deletions by also excising genes (or parts of
genes) along with them; (ii) insertion mutations by the insertion of the
excised genes into other genes, with possible adverse gain of functions; and (iii)
reciprocal translocations as a result of TEs activity. Cells keep these repetitive
elements silent by carrying out genome-wide DNA methylation. In cancer cells
this methylation is gradually lost, resulting in the above-mentioned induced mutations.</span><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><i>Igf2</i><span> is an imprinted growth promoter gene that is active in the paternal
allele but silent in the maternal allele. The imprint control region (ICR) of
paternal <i>Igf2</i> allele is methylated
whereas that of the maternal allele is unmethylated. In the maternal allele,
due to this lack of methylation, CTCF (an insulator protein) can associate and
bind to the ICR (insulator element), preventing the downstream enhancers from
reaching <i>Igf2</i> and thus from activating
its expression. Instead the enhancers now activate the unmethylated <i>H19</i>. In contrast, in the paternal
allele, methylation at the ICR inhibits association of CTCF to the ICR and thus
the enhancers are able to enhance <i>Igf2</i>
expression. In addition, methylation spreads to the promoter of <i>H19</i> further silencing this gene as well.
<br />
Hypermethylation of the ICR of the maternal allele prevents CTCF from
insulating <i>Igf2</i>, and as a result the
expression of <i>Igf2</i> would now be
occurring by both alleles. This over-expression of this growth promoter gene
contributes to Wilm’s tumour formation.</span><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-gb" xml:lang="en-gb">The covalent linkage of methyl groups at
CpG dinucleotides is carried out by means of protein enzymes known as
DNA-methyl transferases (DNMTs). These epigenetic changes are heritable, but potentially
reversible. Since hypermethylation of CpG islands is known to occur in cancer cells
by its involvement in the silencing of tumour suppressing genes, DNMTs can be
targeted for inhibition as part of cancer treatment. Decitabine is one such
inhibiting drug. Decitabine is known as a DNA-demethylating agent and acts by binding
irreversibly to DNMTs and thus inhibiting their enzymatic action, therefore
indirectly inhibiting the progression of methylation to hypomethylated sites. At
low doses, decitabine inhibits the epigenetic inheritance of methylation at CpG
islands during cell division, so tumour suppressing genes are no longer
silenced. This will stop the progression of those tumours resulting from
aberrant DNA methylation like myelodysplastic syndrome by allowing correcting
mechanisms to take place in subsequent cell generations.<span>  <br /></span></span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>DNA
methylation is copied during DNA synthesis and is therefore heritable both
somatically and through the germline. During the mammalian life cycle there are
certain phases during which the organism’s epigenome undergoes extensive remodelling
and is very sensitive to environmental influences. These are defined as
sensitive periods, and mammals undergo through two such phases both of which
happen (or have their beginning) during embryogenesis. One of these phases takes
place during primordial germ cell migration and gonad formation in mid-gestation
embryo up to gamete formation and maturation during adolescence and adulthood. Thus
use of epigenetic drugs during this period should be avoided as not only it could
have adverse effects on the growing embryo, but also on its potential offspring
and such treatment could be considered unethical. The second period occurs
during pre-implantation and early development until blastocyst formation. The
use of epigenetic drugs is also contraindicated during this time as there is a
high potential for adverse effects such as imprinting disorders or failure to
silence transposable elements which could cause genome-wide disruption. Thus
the use of epigenetic drugs, unless used carefully can have unwanted effects in
future generations. </span><br /></div>
