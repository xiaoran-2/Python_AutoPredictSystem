    <h1>Submission 469 from Anon (session_user_id: 09e6a1182a3d6e1fa0d1a8b6ef7d186f3c495a2a)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The class of inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to is DNA methyltransferase inhibitors.<br />Hypomthylation i.e.less than usual methylation is the main impact that Decitabine has on  DNA methylation.<br />Decitabine can have an anti tumour effect as it has been linked to reactivation of epigenetically silenced tumour suppressor genes,as its' onset is caused by hypomethylation.<br />Decitabine can be used in treating cancer as it is quite helpful in treating myelodysplatic syndrome i.e. when the bone marrow produces deformed blood cells.<br /><br />REF and some of the work from:-Epigenetics notes coursera, old

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because it can be altered for once and during mitosis the DNA methyltransferases preserve the methyl marks.<br />Sensitive period is a critical period.<br />The periods in which extensive epigenetic reprogramming occurs such as time of conception of a child,pregnancy,early childhood development.<br />During sensitive periods treating patients such as pregnant mothers,to be mothers,etc, as a whole lot of epigenetic reprogramming happens in early childhood development and during formation of gametes also.<br /><br />REF and some of the work from:-Epigenetics notes coursera, old

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a cell The CpG islands are hypomethylated, and the intergeneic regions,  introns and repetitive elements are  hypermethylated.<br />In a cancer cell, CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated, and the latter regions are hypomethylated.In CpG is lands this leads to silencing of the tumor suppressing genes,which thereby allows cell to divide much faster,much faster than the division of its neighbouring cells,which ultimately leads to formation of a tumour . For the latter regions, normally hypermethylation at these sites is associated with greater genomic stability, so hypomethylation during cancer leads to copying errors such as deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations in the chromosomes.<br /><br />REF and some of the work from:-Epigenetics notes coursera, old notes(Stanford),internet,wikipedia,text book,epigenetics text book,recommended reading<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the H19/Igf2 locus  the methylation of the paternal allele and there is no methylation for the maternal allele. The CTCF complex binds to the allele on the maternal strand and the downstream enhancers act on H19.The CTCF complex does not bind to the paternal allele due to the methyl marks, which leads to silencing of the H19 gene instead of Igf2. <br />So, both H19 from maternal strand, and Igf2 from paternal strand. When
 
this cluster becomes hypermethylated, both strands appear to be of paternal origin and get
 
expressed as such. Thereby,there is doubled release or dose of growthpromoting Igf2.This is related to Wilm's tumour which is a cancer of the kidneys.This explains how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.<br /><br /><br /><br />REF and some of the work from:-Epigenetics notes coursera, old
