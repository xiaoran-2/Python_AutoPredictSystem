    <div class="field-value"><div>The normal function of CpG islands is usually an unmethylated state.  This occurs in 60% of promotors and are usually tumor suppressor genes (Egger 2012).  Cancer can either alter the promotor sequence genetically (mutation), or alter it via methylation (epimutation).  These epimutations occur much more frequently because they are mitotically heritable and selected for due to these cells ability to rapidly divide and avoid cell death.  Because methylation of these promotors inactivates tumor suppressor genes, these genes can no longer keep the cell in check and therefore lead to the uncontrolled proliferative state of cancer (Module 7.2). </div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>In normal cells, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated.  However, in cancer, there is a swapping of methylation status from methylated at these regions, to unmethylated.  Generally, genome-wide hypomethylation occurs in cancer, specifically, the repetitive and intergenic regions.  This is because the genome is made up mostly of intergetnic regions and repetitive elements rather than CpG islands.  The function of methylation of repetitive/intergenic regions is to maintain genomic stability. With these regions unmethylated (unpacked and not heterochromatized) , they are prone to illegitimate recombination (reciprocal translocations), leading to activation of an oncogene.  These repeats can also be activated and jump around in the genome and activate neighboring genes, particularly oncogenes (Module 7.4)</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>In normal cells methylation of imprint control regions (ICR) occurs in a parent of origin specific matter.  In cancer cells, genes that should be expressing monoallelic parent of origin specific expression, i.e. imprinted, are in fact not.  They are either expressed in both parental alleles, or silenced in both parental alleles.  These genes are typically involved in growth (Module 7.3)<br /><br /></div>
<div>In the H19/Igf2 cluster, the paternal allele is methylated while the maternal allele is unmethylated. With the ICR unmethylated (maternal), CTCF will bind to the insulator preventing enhancers from activating Igf2 expression.  Instead, expression of H19 will occur.  In the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated preventing CTCF from insulating Igf2.  Thus, enhancers can stimulate expression of Igf2, a normal case.  When you have methylation on both the paternal and maternal alleles (ICR regions), you have a double dose of Igf2, a growth promoting gene.  This happens because <span>one allele methylation status has changed preventing insulation by CTCF (Module 7.3).  Another link between disruption of normal methylation of ICRs is CTCF binding.  Hypermethylation of ICRs and the prevention of CTCF binding is linked with silencing of p16^INK4a and chromatin upstream boundary loss, which further signifies genome instability (Egger 2012)</span></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Decitabine falls under the category of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, or DNMTi (Module 7.9). This is a small molecule inhibitor that inhibits the function of epigenetic machinery gone awry in cancer, specifically Myelodysplastic sydrome.  These target enzymatic epigenetic regulators that lay down epigenetic marks. Decitabine is a drug against DNA methyl transferases, and a nucleoside analog that binds irreversibly to DNMTs and therefore cannot release them.  Thus, this process is replication dependent, and hits cancer cells the most because of their rapid replication and division.  By preventing the DNMTs from transfer methyl groups in dividing DNA, you prevent them from laying down methylation marks (Module 7.9). Specifically for AML, there is heavy CpG methylation (recall that CpG methylation is non-existent in normal cells because these are usually on promotors of tumor suppressing genes (Egger 2012).  Decitabine works by preventing the methylation of CGIs, an effective treatment for this disease. </span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Altering DNA methylation during cancer treatment for younger patients may have an effect on developing germ cells, specifically those who wish to bear children later in life.  There are sensitive periods in which alteration of normal methylation may happen, two of which are embryogenesis (early pre and post-implantation stage) and gametogenesis (including primordial germ cell development).  These two events involve a lot of epigenetic reprogramming, clearing, and re-establishing of epigenetic marks.  These are sensitive periods because any alteration in the normal methylation and re-establishment of marks can lead to subtle changes in ICR (imprint control regions) methylation.  An example of epigenetic disruption during these sensitive periods is the Dutch Famine Birth Cohort study, where famine exposure during the peri-conceptual period led to metabolic disorders such as diabetes and obesity.  Molecularly, this was due to subtle methylation changes in the ICRs of IGF2, GNAs, and other metabolic genes (Module 5.4).  Treating patients with DNMTi's (DNA methyltransferase inhibitors) during these sensitive periods can alter normal imprinting mechanisms, much in the same way the environment alters methylation of crucial ICRs as mentioned earlier.  It's best to avoid treatment during the peri-conceptual stage as well as during stages of gametogenesis.  </span></div>
