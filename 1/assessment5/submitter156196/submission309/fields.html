    <h1>Submission 309 from Anon (session_user_id: eaa814cd20f6051a113b1fd87e13baab43634a23)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. It is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, which are the precursors of acute myelogenous leukemia. Myelodysplastic syndromes involve hypermethylation, which is counteracted by Decitabine. By countering these syndromes, the passage to acute leukemia is suppressed.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are often located around the promoters of frequently expressed genes, in which case they are normally unmethylated. When they are around normally unexpressed genes, they are normally methylated.</p><p>In cancerous cells, these patterns are often reversed---the normally methylated CpG islands are hypomethylated and the normally unmethylated islands are hypermethylated.</p><p>This inversion of methylation patterns entails increased karyotypic instability and the inappropriate activation of growth-promoting genes.</p><p>DNA methylation in intergenic regions causes the DNA to become compact and hence unavailable for transcription. DNA methylation of repetitive elements, especially CpG islands, renders them inactive, which is function for DNA transcription.</p><p>When this DNA methylation is disrupted, the resulting karyotypic stability is undermined, as described above, leading to uncontrolled grown.k</p><p>Because repetitive elements represent a large portion of the human genome and contain much of the CpG methylation found in normal                     human postnatal somatic tissues, it is widely believed that loss of DNA methylation in these sequences is involved in most human cancers..</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal gene, the CTCF and H19 regions are methylated and inactivated, so two enhancers upstream from the H19 activate the Igf2 paternal gene. This is an insulin-like growth factor.</p><p>In the maternal gene, the Igf2 is methylated (inactive) and the H19 is unmethylated. Two enhancers upstream from the H19 activate<br />the H19, and the unmethylated CTCF region downstream from H19 prevents these enhancers from activating the Igf2,<br />which is downstream for CTCF. Thus H19 is activated and Igf2 is not.</p><p><br />Beckwith Wiedeman syndrome occurs when the maternal allele behaves like the paternal allele in terms of methylation. It involves fetal and post-natal overgrowth, macroglossica, and embryonic/childhood tumors, such as the Wi8lms kidney tumor.</p><p>Because the disruption of imprinting in the H19/Igf2 cluster, the genes behave as if they were both inherited from the same parent, leading to either excessive or inadequate growth expression. Excessive expression leads to karyotype instability and uncontrollable growth---cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation has enduring effects because methylation is mitotically inheritable, so a change remains in the individual for life.</p><p>A sensitive period is a developmental stage in which the pattern of epigenetic marks is especially subject to environmental influence.</p><p>Gametes are highly methylated, but from fertilization to the blastocyst stage, demethylation occurs,<br />actively for the paternal gene and passively for the maternal. Methylation increases from the blastocyst to the epiblast stage, and this is a sensitive period.</p><p>In the premoridal germ cells, demethylation occurs, and remethylation takes place in the formation of the next generation of gametes. This is another sensitive period.</p><p>Because methylation is mitotically heritable, it is inadvisable to interfere with the normal process of methylation in sensitive periods, and the effects are for the life of the individual.</p><p><br /></p></div>
