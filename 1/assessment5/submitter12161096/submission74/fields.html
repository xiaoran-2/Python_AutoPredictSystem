    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells CpG-islands
are unmethylated and corresponding genes are active, whereas intergenic regions
and repetitive elements are methylated and that way silenced.</p>

<p>In case of cancer that is turning:
CpG-islands (and shores) of promoters are often (local specific) hypermethylated
and genes are silenced this way. In case of a tumor suppressor gene this would
lead to loss of cell cycle control and cancer.</p>

<p>Repeats and intergenic
regions often are genome-wide hypomethylated leading to activation of this
regions (means that e.g. enzymes can act there now) and due to genomic instability; e.g.
illegitime recombination of repeats or transposition of former silenced transposons.
So normal cell function is lost and cancer is developed.</p>

<p>And there can also happen a
hypomethylation of CpG-poor promoters which often are on oncogenes. These genes
are activated that way and in consequence cell switches into tumor state.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The cluster consists of Igf2
and N19 gene and in between an ICR. Downstream of H19 the enhancers of Igf2 are
located.</p>

<p>In normal cells, ICR of
paternal allele is methylated whereas ICR of maternal allele is unmethylated
(imprinted Igf2).</p>

<p>If unmethylated, the
insulator-protein CTCF can bind on ICR and "insulate" Igf2 from its
downstream-promoters. Igf2 is silenced. H19 is expressed.</p>

<p>If methylated, CTCF can`t
bind and DNA-methylation spreads to H19-promotor. H19 is therefore not
expressed. Now, the Igf2-enhancer can work and Igf2 is expressed.</p>

<span>In
Wilm´s tumor a hypermethylation of maternal allele happens. In consequence,
both alleles are in same (paternal-like) activation state: H19 inactive, Igf2
active. Because Igf2 is a growth factor and now overexpressed, the cell
switches in tumor state</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-metyltransferase-inhibitor
(DNMTi).</p>

<p>It`s a nucleosid-analogon (for Desoxycytidin) which is built in DNA instead
of "normal" nucleotide during DNA-replication. For that reason,
Decitabine can only act in cells that are able to divide and therefore must
replicate their DNA.</p>

<p>Once incorporated in DNA, Decitabine interacts with
DNA-metyltransferase and binds it irreversible. That way, this enzyme was
inhibited and can`t methylate the DNA anymore. So the grade of DNA-methylation
decreases.</p>

<p>Decitabine is unspecific and toxic in higher
concentrations. It enters in both normal and cancer cells but cell division
rate in tumors is higher and so the effect of Decitabine there too. So,
Decitabine would kill mainly tumor cells (anti-neoplastic effect).</p>

<p>Cancer often is coupled on DNA-hypermethylation of CpG-islands
of tumor suppressor genes, effecting their silencing, and on ICR, effecting the
loss of imprinting. Decitabine maybe act in lower doses preferred at these
locations.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Sensitive periods are cell cycle phases in which
epigenetic reprogramming occurs. During these periods the environment has
strong influence on epigenome make-up (can alter "normal" status). </p>

<p>First period is during the early embryonic development
(zygote to blastocyst) when maternal and paternal methylation marks are
cleared.</p>

<p>Second period is primordial germ cell development (production
of mature sperms/eggs) starting in the later Embryo-state and continuing until
adulthood.</p>

<p>Third period is the active re-modelling during
tissue-specific cell differentiation (specialization) forced in embryonic organogenesis
but happens lifelong (stem cells).</p>

<p>For these reasons neither pregnant women nor children
should be treated with epigenetic drugs. This would dangerous for next
generation(s) because of destroying normal epigenetic pattern (heritability).</p>

<p>A fourth (relative short) period happens after every
mitotic cell division when on the hemi-methylated DNA the new synthesized daughter
strand is methylated using paternal strand as pattern.</p>

<p><span>This last period maybe the basis for effects seen in
chemotherapy after epigenetic treatment with DNA-methylation altering drugs:
Once established methylation pattern are "mitotic
heritable", means the daughters of treated mother cell will have her
changed pattern. If drug-made changes would make cell more sensitive for
chemicals/radiation (induced sensitivity), all cells of this line will have this
trait.</span></p></div>
