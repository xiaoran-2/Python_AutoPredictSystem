    <div class="field-value"><div>Methyl substitution of cytosine bases in the cytosine-guanine pairs of DNA is found in about 70 to 80% of mammalian somatic cell DNA. Usually this is associated with gene silencing. An exception is the CpG islands of the promoter regions of expressed genes.  In these areas, CpG is usually kept unmethylated in normal cells, but in cancer cells these CpG islands and their nearby "shore" regions become hypermethylated in a locus-specific way, and so silenced as well. Thus, in cancer cells, promoter genes for regulator proteins coded by genes such as the "tumor suppressor genes" may be silenced, contributing to abnormal activity of these cancer cells.</div><div><br /></div><div>Normally, DNA methylation suppresses transcription of intergenic regions and repetitive elements. This tends to stabilize the cell's epigenetic state of genomic expression.  In cancer cells, there is frequently an overall decrease in DNA methylation.  In cancer, this tends to allow transcription of regions of DNA that are usually not transcribed in somatic cells, including noncoding regions and repetitive elements.</div><div><br /></div><div>Thus, methylation may be disrupted in cancer cells in two, somewhat opposed ways, which may both contribute to the disordered growth and division seen in cancer.  First, the promoters of tumor suppressor genes are often hypermethylated, decreasing the expression of tumor suppressors. This silencing of tumor suppressor genes causes a loss of proper control of the cell cycle, loss of future programmed apoptosis, and loss of proper DNA repair. Second and in an opposite fashion, the overall DNA of the cancer cell is often hypomethylated in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. This tends to lead to genomic instability with facilitation of duplications, translocations and deletions of DNA segments. Along with the loss of methylation related regulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes, these all contribute to cancer tissue's structural disorder and de-differentiation.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Disruption of imprinting can lead to cancer if growth regulation is disrupted in a way that leads to deregulated, increased tissue growth. An example of this disruption of epigenetic imprinting can be seen with the H19/Igf2 gene cluster. </div><div><br />The paternal allele of this gene cluster has DNA methylation of the ICR1 region, which prevents CTCF binding, which then allows promoters to access the promoter region for IGF2. This is permissive for IGF2 gene transcription and results in growth promotion of the embryo. </div><div><br /></div><div>The maternal allele has hypomethlation of ICR1, which allows binding of the regulatory protein CTCF to the imprinting control region (ICR), which prevents transcription of the IGF2 growth factor. Instead, a nearby locus, H19, is promoted and transcribed in maternally imprinted alleles. </div><div><br /></div><div>In Wilm's tumor, deregulation of the IGF2/H19 imprinted region allows IGF2 expression from both parental alleles. In Wilm's, both maternal and paternal ICR1 alleles may be methylated. This prevents CTCF from binding to either allele's ICR, thus causing abnormally high levels of IGF2 in the fetus, causing overgrowth and tumor formation. Thus, disruption of proper imprinting of the H19/IGF2 gene cluster contributes to cancer in such infants by facilitating improper increases in tissue growth.</div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Decitabine (chemical name 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) is a DNA methytransferase inhibitor. As an epigenetic modifier, it works as a hypomethylating agent by binding to DNA in a way that inhibits the DNA methyltransferase mediated methylation of cytosine. Tissues affected by decitabine during their growth and development have less overall methylation of their genome, becoming relatively demethylated in their DNA. </div><div><br /></div><div>Cancer cells often have methylation of the CpG islands in the promoter sites for their tumor suppressor genes. Methylation of the tumor suppression genes leads to lack of those gene products, which can lead to uncontrolled cellular proliferation of these cancer cells. By decreasing improper methylation and so re-establishing the expression of tumor suppressor genes and their cancer-suppressing products, decitabine can change subsequent generations of cancer cells to a more normal epigenetic configuration and so slow or halt the otherwise uncontrolled growth of cancer tissue.</div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Because decitabine inhibits DNA methyltransferase, it decreases DNA epigenetic marks.  Because such methylation can be mitotically inherited, subsequent tumor cell generations will likely be different epigenetically (have less methylation of DNA) even after the decitabine dosing is completed. </div><div><br /></div><div>Such drugs might cause birth defects in future offspring, so conception should be avoided in persons who have recently taken epigenetic modifiers. For example, it is recommended that men who take decitabine use a condom to prevent pregnancy during and for two months after decitabine treatment.</div><div><br /></div><div>Such care would be especially important for dosing such drugs during "sensitive periods" of epigenetic development. Such "sensitive periods" are times when epigenetic reprogramming is taking place: during early pregnancy, after menache and before menopause in females, and during pre-adolesence in boys. These are all times of epigenetic resetting of the germ cell line of the gametes or of the early embryo.</div><div><br /></div><div>If decitabine treatment affects gametes of patients during such sensitive periods, this could cause epigenetic anomalies such as Russell-Silver dwarfism in the offspring. If the sensitive period of the developing embryo is affected by decitabine, this could cause miscarriage or birth defects.</div><div><br /></div></div>
