    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a healthy cell maternal allele is unmethalated at ICR (imprinted control region) and this allows CTCF to bind to ICR and block enhancers' access to Igf2 gene. Enhancers in this case activate expression of H19 gene and Igf2 gene is not transcribed. <br />Paternal allele normally has methalated ICR. This protects ICR from binding of CTCF and thus there's nothing blocking Igf2 gene from enhancers. On a paternal allele Igf2 gene is expressed and H19 gene is silenced. <br />Wilm's tumour is specific kidneys' cancer. Desease is associated with methylation of ICR of H19/Igf2 cluster on BOTH paternal alleles. Patients with Wilm's tumour have Igf2 gene expression from both alleles so twice as much Igf2 protein than healthy person.  Igf2 is growth promothing protein an its overexpression contributes to tumour growth.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell CpG islands are hypomethylated. By contrast in cancer cells CpG Islands are much more likely to be methylated. There are a lot of CpG islands in promoters of tumour suppressor genes (TSG) so one of the ways CpG island hypermethylation contribute to cancer is by silencing TSG. Mitotic heridability of methylation allows cancer cells to maintain this silencing through cell division.    <br />Intergenic regions and repetetive elements in normal cells are methylated. In cancer these regions (along with CpG poor promoters and some ICRs) are hypomethylayed. Lack of methylation at repetitive elements and intergenic regions lead to genomic instability witch may result in cancer.  </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is DNA-demethylating agent and is used to treat myelogenous syndromes. Decitabine causes DNA hypomethylation (makes DNA less methylated). In cancer cells promoters of tumour suppressor genes (TSG) are methylated and thus TSG are silenced. Lack of TSG activity results in uncontrolled growth and proliferation of cancer cells. Decitabine is able to demethylate promoters of this genes and restore their nornal functionality and thus normal cell growth and division. <br />Along with course materials I used description of decitabine here - <a href="http://chemocare.com/chemotherapy/drug-info/decitabine.aspx">chemocare.com/chemotherapy/drug-info/decitabine.aspx</a><span> </span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">There is effect that lasts beyond the period of drug treatment because epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation are mitotically heritable. If drug can alter DNA methylation in one parent cell, all of the daughter cells will have the same epigenetic marks. This stays true for a lifetime of an organism with an exception of two sensitive periods - early embryo (pre-implantation) development and germ cell development. Sensitive period in epigenetics is a period of reestablishment of epigenetic marks. In this periods cells go through clearing and resetting of most of its epigenetic marks (repeats are never cleared and imprinted genes are only cleared and reset through germ cell development). Treating patients during sensitive periods with drugs that effect DNA methylation/acetylation or any other epigenetic mark is inadvisible because during these periods all of the future functions of cells are set. Any change in epigenetic marks specific to cell type may lead to disfunction or even cell death. Due to mitotic heritability wrong position of <span>epigenetic marks </span>will have lasting effect on health of an organism and/or its offsprings. </div>
