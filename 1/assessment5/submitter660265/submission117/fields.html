    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is in general involved in X-chromosome inactivation, imprinting, heterochromatin formation and cell differentiation; thus controlling expression.<br />Cancers incorporate several mechanisms that attribute to its proliferation. These mechanisms have been studied in a genome-wide manner and have been found to show a pattern of silenced expression of CpG island tumor suppressor genes through DNA hyper-methylation, an elevated activation of  expression of oncogenes genome-wide in intergenic and repetitive regions through DNA hypo-methylation and repair mechanisms that render cells immortal through removing methyl marks added to damaged cells that should go through apoptosis.<br />In normal tissues, CpG islands are not heavily methylated. However it has been shown that islands (along with CpG island shores) show distinct patterns of increased hypermethylation, pending upon tumor type, tissue and tumor stage. Tumor suppressor hypermethylation was also found to occur much more frequently than actual mutations in cancer, which means that tumors could be targeted for therapy, since DNA methylation is a reversible process. For diagnostics and prognostics of cancer, the above mentioned distinct patterns can serve as sensitive biomarkers. It is important also to note that hyper-methylation patterns can be analyzed in a single gene manner, or alternatively for sets of genes. This type of analysis should provide a more in-depth view of the process.<br />In contrast to CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements in normal tissues are more heavily metylated than in cancer, where these regions tend to become increasingly hypo-methylated. Hypo-methylation of these regions leads to genomic instability and consequently to abnormal karyotypes by allowing insertions, translocations and recombinations between repeats. They become increasingly unprotected against disruptions through transcriptional noise or uninhibited antisense transcription.<br />In cancer generally, patterns of long-range silencing and long-range activation is found. Overall DNA hyper-methylation is then a good indicator of cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Cancer can arise from the hypermethylation of the imprint control regions (ICRs) due to loss of imrinting as will be shown for the case of H19/Igf2 case. In this particular case it was found that the maternal allele mimics the expression of the paternal allele, which results in overall Igf2 overexpression and consequently to Wilm's tumor.<br />The paternal allele is methylated at the ICR, which due to heterochromatin spread silences the expression of H19 through methylating the CpG island and the enhancers then act to activate Igf2 gene expression. <br />The maternal allele is not methylated at the ICR, which therefor binds transcritional repressor protein CTCF that in turn acts as in insulator to Igf2 expression. In this case the enhancers promote H19 expression instead of Igf2.<br />In Wilm's tumor, the ICR in the maternal allele is methylated exactly like the paternal allele, such that Igf2 is expressed just as in the case of the paternal allele instead of H19, that is in turn silenced. This leads to an overall increase in the growth factor expression. <br />Wilm's tumor type of kidney cancer has several stages, pending upon the stage of progression, therapeutic alternatives can be offered.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic drugs can act as DNA demethylating agents (Decitabine), as histone deacetylase inhibitors, as histone methyl transferase inhibitors (GSK 126). They  change levels of gene expression through changing chromatin accessibility, structure and epigenetic marks.<br />Decitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) , that are precursors of myelogenous leukaemia. <br />The drug works via inhibiting the activity of enzyme DNA Methyltransferase (DNMT). In MDS, CpG islands are hypermethylated and thus tumor suppressors silenced. Targeting DNMT to inhibit methylation is done using nucleoside analogues that irreversibily bind the enzyme. And because cancer cells replicate excessively, good results can be achieved therapeutically using the drug without having to subject the patient to toxic doses of DNMTi.<br />But there remains open issues, such as the lack of specificity of the drug, long-term consequences are not known at this stage, and that the details of the molecular mechanism of action of the drug need further research.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The above mentioned epigenetic drugs alter the epigenome, that is known to be passed through cell division to daughter cells. The epigenome is mitotically heritable through the lifetime of the organism, and is sensitive to environmental conditions. It is debatable, which parts of the genome are sensitive and why. It is also not clear whether genetic effects lead to epigenetic effects, or it is rather the other way round.<br />For young patients, whose germ cells have not matured yet, it is not advisable to undergo therapies, because these are sensitive periods that can affect sperm and oocyte and lock down permanent epigenetic marks. For male patients pre-puberty years are sensitive to sperm epigenetic changes  conveyable to male offspring via the y chromosome, it is very possible to witness transgenerational meiotic heritability. For developing oocytes effects can vary on offspring starting from the female's fetal/infant to pre-puberty years. Some studies have analyzed data from these sensitive periods, like the Oeverkalix studies or  pre-puberty smoking effects on offspring's BMI.<br />Treatment with drugs that have little specificity of targets, unknown mechanisms of action due to lack of molecular data and unknown long-term effects, are unadvisable for young patients.<br /></div>
