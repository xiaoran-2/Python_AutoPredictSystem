    <div class="field-value">Gene expression can be controlled epigenetically by a huge variety of mechanisms, such as DNA methylation at Cytosine nucleotide, mostly within CpG dinucleotide. DNA methylation can play different roles based on where in the DNA it occurs. CpG islands are regions within promoters of some genes that are particularly rich in CpG dinucleotides. Although they are kept unmethylated most of the time, hypermethylation at these sites on normally active genes silences their expression. Methylated regions can also be found in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br />Due to numerous possible reasons, such as environmental influence, stochastic drift from normal methylation state or disruption of some component of epigenetic machinery, hypermethylation at CpG islands can occur. As a result expression of affected genes is diminished. If the gene in question is a tumour suppressor, silencing results in a decline in growth restricting signals the cell receives and thus in uncontrolled growth and development of cancerous malignancies. DNA methylation is passed onto subsequent generations, which again allows the progenitor cells to grow and divide rapidly. CGIs of different genes can be hypermethylated depending on cancer type. <br />Repetitive elements and intergenic regions serve many roles in the genome, for instance they are useful as structural elements of the chromatin, provide space for recombination to prevent disruption of genes. However some are parasitic sequences or remnants of viruses that can transpose into other loci causing gene aberrations. Mammalian genome is protected from this process by methylating transpozons and thus silencing them. Methylation can also be used to silence cryptic promoters and splice sites in intergenic regions to ensure correct transcription of genes. <br />There is wide-spread hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements in cancer, which contributes to characteristic genomic instability. Loss of methylation allows for activation of transpozons, which increases chance of mutations, and production of truncated proteins or complete disruption of transcription as a result of lack of methylation of cryptic promoters and alternative splice sites. All of these can contribute to cancer phenotypes.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprint Control Region withing H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated on the paternal allele. This prevents CTCF binding and thus insulation of Igf2 gene from downstream enhancers, which can now interact with Igf2 and it can be freely expressed from this allele. Also methylation spreads onto adjacent H19 promoter inhibiting its expression. <br />In contrast ICR is not methylated on the maternal allele, which allows CTCF to bind to it. Bound CTCF is an obstacle to enhancers looping onto Igf2 and hence acts as an insulator. Igf2 expression is silenced on maternal allele. H19 on the other hand remains active, because its promoter is not methylated. <br />Loss of imprinting at H19/Igf2 locus is associated with various tumour types. In Wilm's tumour(a type of kidney cancer) maternal allele is hypermethylated at the ICR, which results in an expression of Igf2 from both parental copies of the gene and lack of expression of H19. Igf2 is involved in growth and proliferation of tissues and its overexpression causes uncontrolled growth and development of tumours. H19 on the other hand normally restricts growth and hence its absence promotes neoplastic growth. <br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA methyl transferases inhibitors. It is an analogue of cytidine nucleoside. It is incorporated into DNA in replicating cells and inhibits maintance of DNA methylation on the daughter strand by covaletly binding DNMT1. This inhibits replication and causes cell death. Decitabine can also directly inhibit DNMT1, which causes hypomethylation of the genome and inhibition of growth in some lymphomas.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. Therefore alterations to the methylation pattern are passed onto daughter generations and are stable even well beyond the duration of action of a drug influencing DNA methylation.<br />Sensitive period of development is a time when epigenetic reprogramming occurs. This can be during preimplantation preriod after fertilisation, during primordial germ cell development, over the whole gestation and childhood. During these times epigenome is particularly sensitive to environmental influences. Because epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable, any alterations introduced at these times will be present in progeny cells influencing gene expression and for instance susceptibility to diseases, such as cancer. For this reason treating children with drugs acting on epigenetic machinery can have long term effects on their health.</div>
