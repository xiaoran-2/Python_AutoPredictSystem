    <div class="field-value">The CpG islands are usually found near promoters of genes.  In normal cells, they are generally hypomethylated, allowing for the expression of the neighboring genes.  Any methylation at these CpG islands usually means gene silencing, as methylated CpG (meCpG) can be bound by proteins such as MeCP1 and MeCP2, which contain a DNA-binding domain and a transcriptional repression domain, thus preventing transcription of those genes.  <br />In cancer cells, these CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated, which results in gene silencing, as described above.  The hypermethylation of CpG islands at the promoters of certain tumor suppressor genes (such as RB gene) causes those genes to be silenced, leading to uncontrolled cellular proliferation.  And since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, these epimutations are rapidly selected, thus further promoting tumorigenesis.<br />In contrast, the intergenic and intronic regions, as well as repetitive elements are found to be methylated in normal cells.  These repetitive elements can transpose and disrupt the expression of other genes; therefore, it is important to silence these repeats through methylation.  Hence, in normal cells, these repetitive elements are silenced through DNA methylation to prevent transposition of these repeats and to prevent transcriptional interference of neighboring genes.  In cancer, however, these intergenic regions and repeats are hypomethylated, which can lead to genomic instability.  As a result, abnormal chromosomal recombinations can occur, such as reciprocal translocations, further causing instability of the genome.  Moreover, there can be insertions and deletions of certain regions of the genome, which can further contribute to uncontrolled cell growth and lead to tumorigenesis.  <br /><br />Sources:  <br />Blewitt,M.  (2015).  1.5 DNA methylation at CpG islands[html5].  Retrieved from <a href="https://class.coursera.org/epigenetics-003/lecture" title="Link: https://class.coursera.org/epigenetics-003/lecture">https://class.coursera.org/epigenetics-003/lecture</a><br />Blewitt,M.  (2015).  1.6 DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements[html5].  Retrieved from <a href="https://class.coursera.org/epigenetics-003/lecture" title="Link: https://class.coursera.org/epigenetics-003/lecture">https://class.coursera.org/epigenetics-003/lecture</a><br />Blewitt,M.  (2015).  7.3 Hypermethylation of sets of CpG islands in cancer[html5].  Retrieved from <a href="https://class.coursera.org/epigenetics-003/lecture" title="Link: https://class.coursera.org/epigenetics-003/lecture">https://class.coursera.org/epigenetics-003/lecture</a><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;

    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;

    <div class="field-value">Most imprinted genes are involved in cell growth.  Therefore, alterations in DNA methylation at imprint control regions (ICR) can result in loss of expression of growth-restricting and overexpression of growth-promoting genes, resulting in uncontrolled cell proliferation.  An example of loss-of-imprinting that leads to tumorigenesis is the H19/Igf2 locus.  <br />Normally, the ICR at H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated on the paternal allele, and this methylation spreads to promoter of H19, resulting in its silencing.  The enhancers located upstream of H19 can interact with Igf2, which is located downstream of the ICR, allowing for Igf2 to be expressed.  <br />In contrast, the ICR is unmethylated on maternal allele, therefore, the CTCF insulator element binds to the ICR, disrupting the interaction between the enhancers and Igf2.  So in the maternal allele, Igf2 is silenced, but H19 is expressed.  <br />However, in Wilm's tumor, the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted because ICR is methylated at both maternal and paternal alleles.  Therefore, Igf2 is expressed on both alleles, and H19 is silenced.  Since Igf2 is a growth-promoting gene, its overexpression (on both alleles due to loss-of-imprinting) causes uncontrolled cellular proliferation, and can lead tumorigenesis.  <br /><br />Sources:  <br />Blewitt,M.  (2015).  7.3 Hypermethylation of sets of CpG islands in cancer[html5].  Retrieved from <a href="https://class.coursera.org/epigenetics-003/lecture">https://class.coursera.org/epigenetics-003/lecture</a><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>

        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;

    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normally, DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) methylates hemi-methylated DNA in replicating cells, ensuring that all daughter strands carry the methylation mark.  Decitabine, a DNMT inhibitor, is a nucleoside analog and gets incorporated into the DNA upon replication.  When DNMT1 binds the DNA strand to copy the methylation mark onto the daughter strand, the now-incorporated Decitabine irreversibly binds DNMT1.  This binding of DNMT1 results in passive DNA demethylation, as there is "dilution" of DNA methylation with every cell division.  This can have anti-tumor effects as the CpG islands near the promoters of tumor suppressor genes are now demethylated, allowing for the expression of those "growth-regulating" genes.  Moreover, because the action of DNMT inhibitors is cell division dependent, the rapidly dividing cancer cells are affected more severely by the DNMT inhibitors than other cells.  <br /><br />Sources:  <br />Blewitt,M.  (2015).  1.5 DNA methylation at CpG islands[html5].  Retrieved from <a href="https://class.coursera.org/epigenetics-003/lecture">https://class.coursera.org/epigenetics-003/lecture</a><br />Blewitt,M.  (2015).  7.9 Drugs that target the epigenetic machinery as chemotherapeutics[html5].  Retrieved from <a href="https://class.coursera.org/epigenetics-003/lecture" title="Link: https://class.coursera.org/epigenetics-003/lecture">https://class.coursera.org/epigenetics-003/lecture</a><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Using drugs that change the epigenome by altering DNA methylation patterns can have an anti-tumor effect even after the therapy has been stopped, as was observed by Dr. Stephen Baylin in his patients.  This is because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, and the alterations in DNA methylation are continued to be passed down to daughter and granddaughter cells, until the cells undergo epigenetic reprogramming during sensitive periods.  The sensitive periods are defined as periods of development during which epigenetic reprogramming ensues, and all the epigenetic marks are removed and reestablished.  These sensitive periods occur during early embryonic development and primordial germ cell development.  Therefore, it is highly inadvisable to treat patients during sensitive periods as they will undergo reprogramming, and all the epigenetic marks will be erased.  Therefore, any alterations to the epigenome made by epigenetic therapy will be rendered useless.  <br />It is also important to avoid treating pregnant women in second half of the pregnancy (post-implantation period) and children undergoing puberty (primoridial germ cell development) with epigenetic therapies as it could have long-lasting effects on their offsprings' epigenome.  <br /><br />Sources:  <br />"Cancer's epicentre."  (2012).  <i>The Economist</i>.  [Magazine article].  Retrieved from <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" title="Link: http://www.economist.com/node/21552168">http://www.economist.com/node/21552168</a><br />Blewitt,M.  (2015).  5.2 Disrupted epigenetic reprogramming in somatic cell reprogramming and cloning[html5].  Retrieved from <a href="https://class.coursera.org/epigenetics-003/lecture" title="Link: https://class.coursera.org/epigenetics-003/lecture">https://class.coursera.org/epigenetics-003/lecture</a><br /></div>
