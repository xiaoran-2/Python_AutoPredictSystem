    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation patterns are found to altered in essentially all cancers. Methylation of DNA refers to the adding of a methyl group (CH3) at cytosine (C) nucleotides adjacent to guanine (G) nucleotides: called CpGs. Cytosine residues at CpG islands are usually not methylated in normal cells, but generally methylation functions to silence gene expression. In cancer cells, CpG islands (CGIs) are more likely to be hypermethylated. Methylation of these CGIs can silence transcription of nearby tumor suppressor genes such as RB and MLHI, resulting in tumor growth. On the other hand, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated. This methylation functions to silence transcription from active promoters within the LTRs of repeats, and to prevent inappropriate interactions between homologous sequences within repeats. Activation of repeats may result in genomic instability: transpositions, deletions, and insertions and interaction between repeats that may result in reciprocal translocations. As these repeat regions tend to be hypomethylated in cancer cells, genomic instability is promoted and therefore abnormal karyotypes tend to result. If the transpositions, deletions, etc. affect genes that are involved in cell cycle control (oncogenes and tumor suppressors) or if they affect genes for epigenetic regulators, then genomic instability will drive tumorigenesis.  </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Loss of normal imprinting for monoallelic gene expression may promote tumorigenesis. Normal imprinting depends upon the epigenetic state of specific imprint control regions (ICRs). For the H19/Igf2 cluster, methylation patterns of the ICRs determine enhancer-blocking and thus gene expression of these alleles. On the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated, so that CTCF cannot bind, allowing downstream enhancers interact with Igf2 promoters, rather than H19,  This results in expression of Igf2. The maternal allele ICR is not methylated, so that CTCF can interact with the ICR. In this case the enhancers do interact with H19, not Igf2, thus preventing Igf2 expression.  In Wilms tumor, both ICRs - paternal and maternal - are methylated, resulting in over-expression of the Igf2 allele. As Igf2 codes for a growth promoting protein hormone, its over expression will lead to an increase in cell divisions and therefore tumor growth. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNMT (DNA methyltransferase) inhibitor, and so it prevents methylation of CpG during DNA replication. In other words, it acts as a replication-dependent DNA-demethylating agent. It is approved for use to treat "myelodysplastic syndromes" - essentially an early stage of acute myelogenous leukemia. Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue, meaning that it resembles a nucleoside well enough to be incorporated into the DNA strand during replication, but then irreversibly binds DNMTs so that methylation of replicated strands cannot occur. Although the mechanism of action is not yet clear, this demethylation could have the effect of re-activating tumor suppressor genes that have been silenced by hypermethylation of CpG islands. These tumor suppressor proteins might then be able to put a brake on the cell cycle and slow tumorigenesis. The anti-tumour effect of DNA methylation appears to be a low, less toxic doses of Decitabine.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Dr. Baylin was suggesting that the epigenetic changes produced by the drugs might allow the cells to "normalize" enough to be susceptible to chemotherapy. DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, as DMNT-1 "copies" the methylation marks onto the newly formed nucleic acid strand during DNA replication. So once DNA is methylated by a drug, that methylation should persist in daughter cells of the tumor. Sensitive periods refer to times during which epigenetic reprogramming occurs, including during gamete development and early embryogenesis. Treating patients who are pregnant or could become pregnant during treatment could certainly affect genome-wide DNA methylation of an embryo, but treatment of children and younger adults may also effect the epigenetic reprogramming of their gametes during primordial germ cell development and so possibly a future generation.</div>
