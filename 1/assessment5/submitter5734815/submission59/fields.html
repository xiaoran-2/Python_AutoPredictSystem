    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer the genome as a whole becomes hypomethylated, but specific CpG islands become hypermethylated. CpG islands are normally
associated with the promoter of a gene, and in a normal epigenome they remain unmethylated. DNA methylation of CpG islands serves
to silence that gene by preventing transcription. The methylation of CpG islands in
cancer can silence tumour-suppressing genes, contributing to the risk of cancer
developing.</p><p>In a normal cell the methylation
of intergenic regions and repetitive elements suppresses the activity of
transposons (‘jumping genes’) that can cause transpositions, insertions and
deletions in the genome. In cancer the global level of
methylation decreases, with a larger decrease as the disease progresses.  This leads to decreased methylation of the
intergenic regions and repetitive elements. The result of the hypomethylation is an increase in
transposon activity, leading to genetic instability. The resulting genetic
mutations can contribute to the development of cancer.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting can
contribute to cancer by increasing the dosage of a gene which is normally
silenced on one parent’s allele, or by completely inactivating a gene that is
normally active on one parent’s allele.</p>

<p>One example if the H19/Igf2 cluster.
This is normally paternally imprinted – in other words, the Imprint Control
Region (ICR) is methylated on the paternal allele. Methylation spreads to the H19
promoter, silencing that gene. Also, a downstream enhancer is brought into
contact with the Igf2 gene, causing expression of that gene. Igf2 is a mitogenic
growth regulator i.e. an oncogene.</p>

<p>The ICR on the maternal allele is
not methylated. This allows H19 to be expressed. The CTCF protein is able to
bind to the unmethylated ICR, which also prevents the downstream enhancer from
reaching the Igf2 gene, downregulating the expression of Igf2. </p>

<p>An imprinting disorder can cause
methylation of the maternal H19/Igf2 ICR. This disorder is associated with Wilm’s
tumour, a childhood kidney cancer. Since both parental alleles now act like a
normal paternal allele, the patient gets a double dose of Igf2, while H19 is
downregulated. The over-expression of oncogene Igf2 promotes the development of
the cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a cytosine nucleoside analog that acts as a DNA-demethylating agent. It becomes incorporated into DNA where it inhibits further DNA methylation. In cancers the promoter regions of tumour-suppressing genes become methylated, which silences those genes. Decitabine demethylates those regions, allowing the tumour-suppressing genes to be expressed and hence reducing the cancer. It is particularly effective in <span>myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).</span> </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitoticaly heritable, because DNMT1 is attracted to hemimethylated CpGs  and fully methylates them. If a drug alters the methylome, this mitotic heritability will maintain those changes after the drug is discontinued. There are sensitive periods during development when cells are epigenetically reprogrammed, i.e. most of the methylation is cleared and then re-established in a lineage-specific manner. The key sensitive periods in mammals are during early embryonic development, with methylation reaching a minimum around the time of blastocyst formation; and during germ cell creation (spermatogenesis and oogenesis). Treating patients with epigenetic drugs during these sensitive periods could disrupt the epigenetic reprogramming, leading to serious side-effects.</div>
