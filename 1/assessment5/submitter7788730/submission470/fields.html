    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value">In normal cells, CpG islands which are promoters of genes are usually unmethylated, which marks silencing of gene expression.<br />In contrast, in cancer cells CpG island are hypermethylated to silence tumor suppressor genes.<br />However, in cancer cells, tumor suppressor genes are hypermethylated at their CpG islands and by simple definition in cancer we have activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressors. Thus this can be considered one of the hits in the Knudson hypothesis.<br />Moreover, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated to maintain genomic stability, by avoiding transposition, transcriptionnal interference and illegitimate recombination. In the same manner, it has been also proposed that DNA methylation at repetitive elements protects the genome (genome defense model).<br /> Conversely, in cancer cells intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated .<br />This disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements in cancer lead to genomic instability by the increase in illegitimate recombinations, the activation of repeats and their transposition, the activation of cryptic promoters and the disruption of neighbouring genes. Thus increase in deletions, reciprocal translocations, insertions...</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cells, at the H19/Igf2 cluster we have :<br />-on the maternal allele binding of the CTCF protein, on the unmethylated ICR, which acts as an insulation thus blocking the enhancers to act on Igf2 gene.The enhancer acts on the H19 gene promoting its expression. So, unmethylation of ICR leads to Igf2 silencing .<br />- on the paternal allele, the methylated ICR doesnt bind the insulator. So, The enhancer acts on Igf2 gene and promotes its expression. Methylation of ICR leads to Igf2 expression.<br /><br />In contrast, in Wilm's tumour, we have hypermethylation of ICR  and consequently we have Igf2 overexpressioof Igf2 (2 doses from maternal and paternal alleles) .<br />Disruption of imprinting at H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer because with loss of imprinting we have overexpression of growth promoting genes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent (DNMT inhibitor).<br />This drug is a nucleoside analogue which irreversibly binds DNMT after they incorporated into DNA, so they are replication dependent.<br />First, the DNMTinhibitors were used at high doses which were found to be toxic and have several side effects because they lack specificity to target cancerous cells.<br />So to promote an anti-neoplastic effect it should be administrated at low doses </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation by using drugs can drastically affects the epigenome because DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark mitotically heritable and stable.<span><br />It is important during epigenetic reprogramming where we  have clearing of epigenetic marks (DNA demethylation) and resetting of marks (DNA remethylation) of the maternal and paternal genomes, these 2 waves occurs at pre-implantation embryo development and primordial germ cells development to control specific genes involved in these 2 critical periods. Also, we have maintenance of DNA methylation in repeats, and in imprinted genes in preimplantation embryo development..<br />This epigenetic mark signature is established during these periods.<br />So variations of this epigenetic mark pattern(DNA methylation) marks a specific well regulated event.<br /></span>Sensitive periods are periods<span> during which there is more </span>sensitivity<span> to the regulatory effects of epigenetic</span><span> control.</span><span><br />Early embryo development and primordial germ cells development are sensitive periods .<br />Treating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable because it will possibly affect germ cells epigenome (eg. in young patients) and this aberrant epigenome will be transmitted via the gametes to the offspring or it will lead to an infertility.<br /><br /></span><br /></div>
