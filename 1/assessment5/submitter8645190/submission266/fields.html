    <div class="field-value">The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to silence gene expression.  Small subsets of CpG islands are methylated between cell types, thus resulting in different types of cells expressing different genes.  However, in normal cells, most CpG islands remain in an unmethylated state. In cancer, CpG islands are hypermethylated.  This results in the silencing of many more genes, like tumor suppressor genes whose job it is to stop the uncontrolled cell growth that causes cancer. [1]  This hypermethylation of CpG islands is frequently found in tumor cells.  
<p>
The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic and repetitive elements is to maintain genomic integrity.  In cancer, intergenic and repetitive elements are unmethylated.  This causes genomic instability resulting from illegitimate recombinations, activation of repeats and transpositions, activation of cryptic promoters and the subsequent disruption to neighboring genes, insertions and deletions.  All of these factors which contribute to genomic instability may result in the development of cancer.  In class, we learned that DNA hypomethylation at intergenic and repeat regions has been found consistently in all cancers ever studied.

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The ICR (imprinting control region) is methylated on the paternal allele.  Since CTCF (an insulator) can not bind to the ICR when it is methylated, this allows enhancers to act on the Igf2 gene.  As a result, Igf2 is expressed.  The maternal allele is unmethylated at the ICR.  This enables CTCF (an insulator) to bind at the ICR.  This allows enhancers to act on the H19 gene and H19 is expressed.  Because enhancers are not acting on the Igf2 gene, the Igf2 gene is silenced and not expressed.
<p>  
In Wilm's tumour, the maternal allele is methylated, which prevents binding of CTCF (an insulator) to the ICR.  As a result the Igf2 gene is expressed by both the paternal and maternal alleles.  Igf2 is a growth promoting gene so overexpression of this gene can contribute to the development of a tumour.  A tumour, which is caused by uncontrolled cell growth, is often a hallmark of cancer.

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent.  It reduces the amount of DNA methylation by removing methyl groups from histones (proteins associated with DNA).  Since DNA methylation leads to gene silencing, removal of methyl groups would allow for gene expression.  Tumour suppressor genes, which were originally methylated and silenced, could become unmethylated and expressed with the use of a DNA-demethylating drug like Decitabine.  The expression of tumour suppressor genes can have an anti-tumour effect.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable.  This means that changes to DNA methylation are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. [1]  A sensitive period is when epigenetic marks are actively erased (removed).  There are two sensitive periods when epigenetic reprogramming occurs.  One is during primordial germ cell development and the other is in early development during the pre-implantation period.  
<p>
Treating patients with epigenetic drugs during the sensitive periods could lead to the loss of maternal and paternal imprinting.  Loss of imprinting may result in the underexpression or the overexpression of certain genes. DNA methylation is one of the final steps that occurs in random X chromosome inactivation (XCI) and serves to lock in the silent state.  Using epigenetic drugs could disrupt X chromosome inactivation by interfering with the addition of methyl groups to one of the X chromosomes.  Using epigenetic drugs could also interfer with the epigenetic state of repetitive elements in the genome which are silenced due to a high level of methylation.  Methylation of these repetitive elements helps maintain genomic stability.
