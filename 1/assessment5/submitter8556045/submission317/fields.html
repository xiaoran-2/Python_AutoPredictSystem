    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value">In normal cells, CpG islands are usually kept free of methylation independent of their activity states. However, in cancer cells CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated, which causes silencing of the underlying genes.  Many of the silenced genes are tumor supperessor genes which control cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair, whose silencing due to CpG islands hypermethylation may further lead to tumorigenesis.  In normal cell genomes, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually hypermethylated which is useful for maintaining of genome integrity and repression of transposable elements. However, in cancer cells, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually hypomethylated which would lead to higher expression of transposons and abnormal DNA recombination. Expression of transposons and abnormal DNA recombination due to hypomethylation of repetitive elements can both lead to instability of cancer genomes which explained the abnormal karyotypes and gene expressing patterns in cancer cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cells, the paternal H19 gene promoter  is hypermethylated, so the paternal H19 gene can not be expressed. However the downstream enhancers could activate expression of paternal Igf2 genes. Meanwhile the maternal H19 gene promoter and its upstream region is not methylated, so downstream enhancers could activate maternal H19 gene expression. However, because the upstream locus of maternal H19 gene is hypomethylated, the insulator protein CTCF could bind to this region and insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. So in normal cells, only the paternal Ifg2 and maternal H19 genes are expressed. In the case of Wilm's tumor, both the paternal and maternal H19 gene promoters are methylated, so Igf2 genes in both chromosomes could not be insulated and both Igf2 alleles could be expressed. Igf2 codes insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2 ) protein which is responsible for cell growth. Higher expression of IGF2 due to loss of H19/Igf2 imprinting would promote cell proliferation which may further cause cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a kind of nuceloside analogue, which would work as a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor. Decitabine could irreversibly bind DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA so as to decrease DNA methylation level of the genome in a replication dependent manner. In tumor cells, the promoter CpG islands are usually abnormally hypermethylated, so as to silence expression of many tumor suppressor genes which is one cause of tumorigenesis. Decitabine can reduce the methylation level of these genes' promoter region and reactivate expression of these tumor suppressor genes so as to get an anti-tumor effect. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The DNA methylation pattern of a cell could be passed to its daughter cells through mitosis which serves as a mitotic inheritable epigenetic mark. DNA methylation can further affect many epigenetic modifications thus build up the cell's epigenome. So through mitosis, a cell's epignome could largely passed to the daughter cells through inheritance of its DNA methylation for many generations, which is clearly an enduring effect. The environment could affect a cell's epigenome, so in periods of offspring or germ cell development, the environment can affect an offspring's epigenome through its parent much more easily, these periods can be termed as sensitive periods. Embryo development period is a sensitive period which could directly affect an offspring's eipigenome. The primordial germ cell (PGC) development period is another sensitive period as PGCs would mature to germ cells and further affect offsprings' epigenomes. As mentioned above, in sensitive periods, the environment affect  offsprings' epigenomes much more easily, meanwhile the epigenome is mitotic inheritable. So if a parent is treated with epigenetic drugs during sensitive periods, its offspring is more likely build up an abnormal epigenome, this abnormal epigenome could be passed through mitosis which may further lead to birth of an unhealthy baby. </div>
