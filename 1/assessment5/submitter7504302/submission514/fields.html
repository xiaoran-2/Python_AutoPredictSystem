    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is a mechanism that employs addition of methyl groups to the DNA bases to modify gene expression, typically acting to suppress gene transcription ie. silencing the gene. It typically occurs in the context of a CpG dinucleotide, where the cytosine is methylated at the 5 position. CpG islands are clusters of CpG dinucleotides, and in normal cells are usually unmethylated. The repetitive portion of the genome is heavily methylated. Cancer
 cells, however, exhibit genome wide hypomethylation, most of it concentrated around intergenic DNA and repetitive elements; and a gain 
of methylation at many gene-associated CpG islands. <br /><br />The CpG islands are present in the promoter regions tumor suppressor genes, whose products suppress tumorigenesis. In cancer, the CpG islands on the promoter regions of these tumor suppressor genes are hypermethylated. As a result, these regulatory genes are transcriptionally silenced resulting in a loss-of-function. This contributes towards a hit in cancer, multiple hits build up and eventually result in cancer. DNA methylation has been known to gradually build up with age. Hypermethylated genes found in specific tumors are used as biomarkers, which are commonly used as diagnostic tools in cancer.<br /><br />In healthy cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated to maintain genomic stablity. Typically, cancer cells exhibit hypomethylation of intergenic regions 
which normally comprise the majority of a cell's methyl-cytosine content. Hypomethylation results in expression of genes that were meant to be silenced. Consequently, transposable elements may become active and contribute to the genomic instability observed in cancer cells. They may transpose into other coding regions and activate oncogenes. These hypermethylation and hypomethylation effects are heritable, and patterns of DNA methylation are generally transmitted to daughter cells with a high fidelity.<br /><br />Thus, through the effects of both hypo- and hyper-methylation, DNA 
methylation significantly affects the genomic landscape of cancer cells.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Hypo or hypermethylations of imprint control regions occur to disrupt the imprinting, which is often implicated in cancer. The disruption of the ICR of H19/lgf2 cluster in cancer, is an example of hypermethylation. These modifications are early events, and are commonly found in preneoplastic tissue.<br /><br />In a normal cell, the expression of Igf2 from the maternal allele is silenced and Igf2 is expressed only from the paternal allele. This happens due to the ICR which is unmethylated on the maternal allele and can allow CTCF to bind. As a result, the enhancers act on H19, resulting in expression of H19 and silencing of the Igf2 locus.<br />On the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated and hence, CTCF does not bind to insulate it. Consequently, the enhancers which have a preference for Igf2, direct transcription from Igf2 locus, and H19 is silenced.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumour, there occurs hypermethylation of the ICR on the maternal allele and the expression of Igf2 takes place on both, the maternal allele as well as the paternal allele. This results in a double dose of Igf2 than found in in a normal cell. Igf2 codes for a growth promoting factor, resulting in kidney tumors in children.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Cancer is not only caused by genetic aberrations ocurring as a result of DNA mutations, but also by epigenetic mechanisms. Fortunately, the latter are reversible and several medicines have been targeted at them. <br /><br />Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent, used to 
treat myelodysplastic syndromes which are the precursors of acute myelogenous 
leukaemia. It inhibits a DNA methyl transferase (DNMT) ie. it is an enzymatic epigenetic regulator. Decitabine is approved by the FDA. <br /><br />DNMT inhibitors are nucleoside analogues and get incorporated into DNA, irreversibly binding the methyl group. As a result, the methylated residue is not replicated in the daughter strand during division. These drugs are hence dependent on replication and are especially effective against tumors which rely on hypermethylation to cause neoplasia. AML is one such type of cancer, which relies on the hypermethylation of CpG islands. Decitabine has an anti-tumour effect here since it helps to reduce this methylation.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation alters gene expression in cells as they divide and differentiate from embryonic stem cells to specialized tissue.
 The resulting change is permanent and unidirectional, 
preventing a cell from reverting to a stem cell or converting into a 
different cell type. However, DNA methylation is removed during zygote
 formation and re-established through successive cell divisions during 
development. Methylation modifications that regulate gene expression are
 usually heritable through mitosis; some methylation is also heritable through meiosis and results in genomic imprinting. Hence, when tumor cells are treated with DNA methylation altering agents, the resulting alterations are successfully passed on to the daughter cells, and thus most certainly have an enduring effect as the DNMTs preserve methyl marks during mitosis.<br /><br />Sensitive periods of development are the ones where extensive genetic reprogramming occurs, and which influence DNA methylation patterns of several genes. These periods mostly occur during early embryonic development, when there is removal and re-establishment of epigenetic marks, parent specific imprinting, X inactivation and formation of gametes. It is inadvisable to treat patients during sensitive periods, especially to expecting mothers a few months before conception, because these DNA alterations may interfere with the normal reprograming and normal functioning of the system.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
