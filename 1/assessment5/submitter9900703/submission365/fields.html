    <div class="field-value"><p>Q1  All humans have the same basic genome that makes us human.  The use of on and off switches controlled by whether the DNA is methylated or not,  are necessary so that all proteins are not made in all cells of an individual since specific human genes are expressed differently in differentiated cells.   A normal cell would have unmethylated CpG islands allowing expression of nearby genes.  In cancer the CpG islands are often methylated, silencing the genes they control.  If the gene that is silenced by methylation is a tumor suppressor gene, then rapid growth will not be checked and cancer could result.  Methylation at the CpG site appears to cause more cancers than genetic mutations.  It is also observed that in the course of cancer, the CpG methylation increases with time from onset.  Since increased methylation also occurs to increase with the age of a person, it might explain why so many cancers are seen in the elderly.  Hypermethylation as seen in cancer cells, can be used to diagnose cancer, suggest a prognosis and even supply information about what treatment might be best.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>	There is also a different type of methylation at intergenic  regions and repetitive  elements.  Normal cells have methylation in both the intergenic region and the repetitive elements.   Epigenetic mutations, or changes in DNA methylation of cancerous cells show that intergenic regions and repetitive elements are not methylated.  Receptive elements may be transgenic or due to ancestral virus insertion into the genome.  It is generally beneficial to silence these sites, but cancerous cells leave them open to be expressed.</p><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Q2  Imprinted genes are mono allelic and parent of origin specific.  Loss of imprinting can result in a type of cancer called Wilms’ disease.  Normally the  imprint control region (ICR) of the father is methylated but it is not in the mother.  In the unmethylated state in the mother’s CTCF will bind to the ICR and insulate it,  silencing the IGf2 gene downstream and slowing growth.  In the Dad, the methylated ICR stops the expression of H19 and in turn the enhancers are unblocked and can act of the IGf2 gene which is a growth promoter.  </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>	If there is a loss of imprinting, both the mother’s and fathers ICR is methylated allowing the enhancers to act  on the IGf2 gene, in effect doubling the growth factor.  This double dose of growth factor can produce a childhood tumor of the kidneys called Willm’s  tumor.</p><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Q3  Since epigenetic changes can be influenced by the environment, then chemicals in the environment can be used to change the expression of some genes that cause cancer.  Many cancers are caused by hypermethylation of the DNA or of the histone proteins that surround the DNA.  Drugs that cause hypomethylation like Decitabine act by inhibiting DNA methyltransferases so methyl groups are reduced rather than added. It is a DNA methylation inhibitor.  If a tumor supressor gene was silenced by hypermethylation, then a tumor could grow.  Adding Decitabine will reduce the methylation and allow the tumor suppressor gene to work as it should.  Decitabine also acts as an antimetabolite.  Cells incorporate these molecules which are  similiar to ones usually incorporated, but these cause a cytotoxic effect causing death of rapidly dividing cells.  Chemotherapy after use of this drug will have enhanced effects because of this.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Q4  Altering the DNA methylation with drug therapies can have lasting effects because epigenetic changes are heritable through mitosis.  As epigenetically changed cells divide there will be a dilution factor in effect that will change the percentage of  cells that are methylated in the tumor.  Perhaps cancer can become a chronic disease rather than one that always leads to death,  where the tumors do not have to be killed but can be just stopped from growing.  </p>
<p> However these drugs that could demethylate DNA would have to be used carefully, especially during the sensitive periods of development.  A sensitive period is a time when the resetting of methylationn is accomplished.  Imprinted genes could  also be affected during this time.  Giving a drug that inhibits DNA methyltransferase to a woman who does not yet realize she is pregnant will effect the sensitive period at preimplantion.  If it is given to a woman who is pregnant it could effect the primordial germ cells of her baby, and therefore effect her grandchildren.  Early childhood and growth spurts during puberty might also be sensitive periods to treat with caution. </p></div>
