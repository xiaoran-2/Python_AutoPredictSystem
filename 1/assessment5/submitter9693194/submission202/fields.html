    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are regions of
concentrated adjacent CpG nucleotides and are typically hypo-methylated regions,
and this hypo-methylation correlates with genes that are generally active. CpG
islands are near gene promoters (relative to non-CpG islands content) and this
demethylation is associated with allowing gene transcription. When CpG islands
are methylated (uncommon), then usually the gene is inactive (silenced).</p><p>For some cancer tumour types,
it has been seen that CpG islands become hyper-methylated relative to their
typical or usual condition, and particularly CpG islands near the promoters of
tumour suppressor genes, resulting in silencing of these genes.</p><p><span>Cancers are associated with
uncontrolled cell growth, which is usually caused by multiple hits to functional
elements within the cell. These hits either increase cell growth caused by
amplifying the effects of oncogenes, or reduce cell death, caused by the loss
of function of tumour suppressor genes. The methylation of CpG islands described
above has the effect of suppressing tumour suppressor genes, which could
otherwise act as brakes on uncontrolled cell growth (through cell death).  Usually both increases in oncogene activity
and losses of tumour suppressor activity are present in cancer tumors, and CpG
island methylation is only associated with the later loss of function of some
tumour suppressors.</span></p><p><span>In normal cells, DNA
methylation in intergenic regions, and in repetitive elements, is
hyper-methylated.  Hyper-methylation of
these regions is associated with the suppression of transcription of the otherwise
deleterious DNA found in these regions. DNA hyper-methylation of these regions
(normal) acts directly to inhibit transcription of these regions through
reduced polymerase activity.</span></p><p>In many cancer tumours,
intergenic regions and repeat elements are found to be hypo-methylated,
compared to hyper-methylation of these regions in normal non-tumourogenic cells.</p><p>




























</p><p><span>Hypo-methylation of
intergenic regions and of repeat elements increases the likelihood of
transcription of otherwise deleterious DNA, such as allowing activation of
transposition and repeats, activation of illegitimate promoters, and disruption
of neighboring genes.  These are
hallmarks of cancer tumours and tumourogenesis.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>In the paternal allele, both
the imprint control region (ICR) and H19 are normally methylated.  Igf2 and the ICR compete to bind with Igf2
enhancers (in cis). Since the ICR is methylated, Igf2 enhancers will not bind
to it (the ICR) and are therefore free to bind to Igf2, increasing Igf2
transcription.</span></p><p>In the maternal allele, both
the ICR and H19 are normally unmethylated. With the ICR being unmethylated (in
cis), CTCF can bind to the ICR, which in turn allows H19 to remain
unmethylated. Since H19 is unmethylated, Igf2 enhancers can bind to H19, making
these enhancers not available to bind to Igf2. The lack of Igf2 enhancers at the
Igf2 locus (in cis) has the effect of silencing Igf2.</p><p>In Wilm’s tumour, there is a
loss of imprinting, and both the maternal and paternal alleles are methylated at
the ICR and H19 loci. This has the effect of switching on the maternal allele for
expression of Igf2. Combined with the paternal allele, which was already
expressing Igf2, this has the effect of doubling the expression of Igf2 (both
alleles are now expressing Igf2).</p><p>
























</p><p><span>Igf2 is considered growth
promoting and is implicated in tumourogenesis, especially in pre-neoplastic
tumours. Because of this doubling of the level of Igf2, this is a good
explanation for tumourogenesis in Wilm’s Syndrome.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an epigenetic
inhibitor belonging to a class of drugs that are DNA-demethylation agents. It
is also classified as an antimetabolite.</p><p>DNA-demethylation agents like
Decitabine inhibit DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), thereby causing the loss of some DNA methylation of replicating DNA during mitosis (cells must be dividing to
see this effect).</p><p>






















</p><p>The effect of inhibiting
DNMT, and thereby removing DNA methylation marks, is to counter the effect of
hyper-methylation of CpG islands found in the tumour suppressor genes of some
cancers. The effect is heightened in rapidly proliferating cells, such as
cancer tumours due to the high number of cell divisions. The loss of tumour
suppressor genes is considered to be a major contributor to tumourogenesis, and
restoring these genes will result in suppressed tumour growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA-demethylation agents can
have long lasting effects after the drug is removed, as epigenetic changes are
passed on to progeny cells (epigenetic marks are heritable). The use of these
drugs also appears, at least in in treatment refractory patients, to benefit
from increased response to conventional chemotherapy after receiving use of
these epigenetic altering drugs, though the reasons for this later effect are
not well described in this or similar articles.</p><p>Sensitive periods, in terms
of epigenetics, are generally considered to be periods of epigenetic
reprogramming.</p><p>There are two specific sensitive
periods of development. These are during gametogenesis (in the primordial germ
cells during which epigenetic reprogramming and imprinting takes place), and
during early embryo development, when a second round of epigenetic
reprogramming takes place.</p><p>
























</p><p><span>Treatment with drugs that
alter DNA methylation during sensitive periods could disrupt epigenetic
reprogramming and imprinting of normal (non-tumourogenic) cells, making them
susceptible to tumourogenesis, or by causing other abnormal conditions that might
result from epigenetic reprogramming errors. The disruption of epigenetic
reprogramming could remain with the individual for their entire life.</span></p></div>
