    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is an important epigenetic factor, involved in gene regulation and cell function.<br /><p>CpG
dinucleotides are target sequences for DNA methylation and approximately 70-80
% of CpG dinucleotides in the genome are methylated. Methylation of promoter regions are
generally inversely correlated with gene expression, since methylation normally
silence genes. The exception is CpG islands which is normally unmethylated independent of the activity state of the gene.<br /></p><p><span>If CpG islands in promoters becomes methylated,
the gene will be silenced. Methylation is mitoticaly herritable, and is
therefore an effective way keeping the genes silent over time. </span>If the promoter regulates a tumor suppressor gene,
this silencing can cause cancer. <span>These cells are in
addition rapidly selected for, increasing the number of cancer cells rapidly. <br /></span></p><p>Intergenetic
regions and repetitive elements are generally metylated in normal cells. This
metylation promotes genetic stability, for instance by silencing transposable
elements. 

In cancer cells, these intergenetic regions and
repetitive regions are hypometylated. This causes genetic instability. Illegitimate recombination between repetitive regions can cause chromosome translocations;
activation of transposable elements that used to be silent may cause insertions into important genes disrupting the genes function; activation of cryptic
promoters can cause activation or disruption of neighbouring genes. These genetic instabilities can cause cancer by upregulation/activation of tumor suppressor genes, and/or down regulation/inactivation of oncogenes.<br /></p><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In
imprinted genes, the methylation pattern of the different alleles is normally
determined based on the parent of origin. In cancer cells, this parent of
origin specific pattern is lost, and both alleles are either active or
repressed. Many of the imprinted genes are involved in growth, and is therefore
relevant to cancer.<br /></p><p>The
H19/Igf2 cluster is normally regulated by imprinting. The maternal imprinting control region (ICR) is
unmethylated, and an insulator called CTCF binds to the ICR. This causes
downstream enhancers to act on the H19 gene, instead of Igf2 which is the normally preferred target. Igf2 is hence not expressed.</p><p>The
paternal ICR is mehtylated, and the CTCF insulator is unable to bind to the region.
The downstream enhancers are now free to act on the Igf2 gene and activate Igf2
expression.</p><p><span>With loss of imprinting, both alleles will be
metylated and acting like a paternal allele. This causes over expression of
Igf2, and very little expression of H19. Since Igf2 is a growth protein, where
as H19 limits cell growth, this helps tumor development and can contribute to
cancer.</span><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine
is a DNA demethylating agent. It inhibits DNA methyl transferase activity by binding to the DNMT, inhibiting its function (a DNMTi). DNMTs methylate hemi methylated
DNA, and makes DNA methylation mitoticly heritable. When DNA methylt ransferases
are inhibited, the DNA will be passively demethylated during cell division.<br /></p><p>CpG island
in promotor regions of tumor supressor genes, tends to be highly metylated in
cancer cells. Decitabine demethylates these regions. When the genes are no
longer silenced, they can transcribe their tumor supressing products killing
the cancer cell. Decitabine is dependent on cell devition, but since cancer
cells divides more rapidly than normal cells they will be more severely
effected.

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA
methylation is mitoticly heritable, and alterations to the DNA methylation
pattern (epigenome) can therefor last through the organisms lifetime.<br /></p><p>The
epigenome is especially vulnerable to external influence in certain time periods
called sensitive periods, where the epigenome is reprogrammed. <br /></p><p>Some of
these periods are during the formation of primordial germ cells in an embryo, during the early
embryonic development right after fertilization, and when
the germs cells are maturing during for instance the slow growth period before puberty.<br /></p><p>Treating patients with drugs altering the
epigenome during sensitive periods, may cause epigenomic changes in the next
generations as well as in the patient, and should be administered with causion. This is especially relevant for pregnant women, or couples trying to conceive. In the first case the the fetus and the developing germ cells are directly affected, and in the second case, the germ cells that might become a baby are in a late stage of development before maturing (cell differentiation).<br /></p></div>
