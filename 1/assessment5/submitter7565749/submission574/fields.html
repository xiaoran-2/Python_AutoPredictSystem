    <div class="field-value"><div>DNA methylation is essential for normal development, and when deregulated, contributes to diseases like cancer. Over 98% of DNA methylation occurs in a CpG dinucleotide context in somatic cells. There are two types of DNA methylation abnormalities - DNA hypermethylation that is locus specific, and genome-wide hypomethylation.  The genome in general is methylated in their repetitive elements through the intergenic regions and in the introns of genes. In contrast at a cancer cell in general, the CpG islands are more likely to be methylated and the rest of the genome, including the repetitive and these intergenic elements, and the introns, to be hypomethylated. Since methylation plays an important role in controlling normal cellular development, the aberrations within this mechanism may be implicated in the abnormal gene control which characterizes cancer. In a normal cell, what you see is a hypomethylated CPG island, so you don't see methylation in general at CPG islands. So, we observe this kind of exchange or replacement in terms of where the DNA methylation is found. The CpG islands are found in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes. As Knudson proposed, we would have to have multiple hits in order for cancer to occur. For example, we would need to also activate an oncogene. This CpG island hypermethylation and associated gene silencing occurs really frequently in essentially all tumours that have ever been studied. The cells that have this epimutation are more likely to divide more rapidly, or to not die as much, and, therefore, they will take over. And this is indeed how cancer's eventuate. So the critical difference between hyper-methylation of a CPG island as a way to inactivate a tumour-suppressor gene, in comparison to a genetic mutation is that these epimutations, the DNA hypermethylation, is reversible. </div><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>The disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer by altering or suppressing respective cellular biochemical processes depending of the particular controlled region and the function of its genes. We can find either hypomethylation or hypermethylation of ICR. Looking at the Igf2H19 cluster, around the H19/Igf2 locus we normally see the ICR is methylated on the paternal allele, and it's unmethylated on the maternal allele. When enhancers can act on Igf2, as the CTCF complex is not binding to inhibit this, IGF2 is expressed from the pattern allele. When it is unmethylated with the loss of imprinting, the CTCF binds to the allele on the maternal strand and the downstream and as a result the enhancers act on H19 instead. Now, on the maternal allele, we also have expression of Igf2. The CTCF complex does not bind to the paternal allele due to the methyl marks, which leads to silencing of the H19 gene as the enhancers instead drive expression of Igf2. So now you have a double dose of the growth promoter Igf2, as well as no dose of H19 in comparison to what you saw in a normal cell.</div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Decitabine is a drug that is altering DNA methylation and belongs to a class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent and thus contributes to hypomethylation of DNA. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. Dr Baylin speculates that his epigenetic drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy. It belongs to the DNA-demethylating agents, specifically DNMT Inhibitors. Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation and has dual effects on neoplastic cells, including the reactivation of silenced genes and differentiation at low doses and cytotoxicity at high doses. Decitabine has an anti­tumour effect that is linked to reactivation of epigenetically silenced tumor supressor genes, induced by the hypothemylation. It is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes (conditions under which the bone marrow produces deformed blood cells), the precursors of acute myelogenous leukemia, and a rare illness called cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.</div><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>DNA methylation is a kind of regulation and adjustment of gene expression. It can be manipulated once with lasting results as the DNA methyltransferase enzymes sustain methyl marks throughout mitosis. The global interferences could affect ordinary working of the system, particularly during sensitive periods ­ stages when wide-ranging epigenetic reprogramming occurs. These sensitive periods are when the environment may be able to influence epigenetic makeup. So, the period of primordial germ cell development through to the production of mature eggs and sperm is the first one of the sensitive periods, and the second is the pre-implantation period and early post-implantation period. Both of these periods are periods of active remodelling of the epigenome.  It ise inadvisable to recommend the usages of drugs that alter DNA methylation in these specific sensitive periods as a lot of reprogramming ensues in early embryo development as well as during the establishment of gametes. </div><br /></div>
