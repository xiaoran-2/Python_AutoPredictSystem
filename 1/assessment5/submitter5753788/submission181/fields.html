    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The
purpose of methylation at CpG islands in particular is primarily to silence a
gene permanently or downregulation a gene. In cancer cells promoter CpG islands
tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying
gene. Hypermethylation of promoter CpG islands causing a silencing of tumor
suppressor genes – controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair. Intergenic
methylation may be in regulating cell context-specific alternative promoters in
gene bodies and perhaps also prevent aberrant expression from intragenic
promoters. In a cancer cell,: CpG islands are more likely to be
hypermethylated, and the latter regions are hypomethylated. For the CpG
islands, hypermethylation leads to problems as tumor suppressor genes may become
silenced, allowing the cell to divide more rapidly, outcompete its neighboring
cells, and grow into a tumour. For the latter regions, normally
hypermethylation at these sites is associated with greater genomic stability,
so hypomethylation during cancer leads to copying errors such as deletions,
insertions and reciprocal translocations in the chromosomes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>In a cell around
the H19/Igf2 locus we ordinarily see the methylation of the paternal allele at
the ICR, and no methylation for the maternal allele. The CTCF complex binds to
the allele on the maternal strand and the downstream enhancers act on H19 as a
result. The CTCF complex does not bind to the paternal allele due to the methyl
marks, which leads to silencing of the H19 gene as the enhancers instead drive
expression of Igf2. Thus, in a regular cell we observe a normal dose of both
H19 from maternal strand, and Igf2 from paternal strand. However, when this ICR
becomes hypermethylated, both strands appear to be of paternal origin and get expressed
as such. That is, the system gets a double dose of (growth­promoting) Igf2 (as
well as no dose of H19). This is associated with Wilm's tumour.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine belongs
to a class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, and thus contributes to hypomethylation
of DNA. This turns out to be particularly useful in treating myelodysplatic syndrome
(conditions under which the bone marrow produces deformed blood cells), which
is a precursor of acute myelogenous leukemia. In case of Decitabine, the
anti­tumour effect has been linked to reactivation of epigenetically silenced
tumor supressor genes, induced by the hypothemylation.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation is
a particularly attractive form of regulation to target in treatments because it
can be manipulated once, and enduring effects are ensured as the DNA
methyltransferase enzymes preserve methyl marks during mitosis. However, these
global interventions may interfere with ordinary functioning of the system,
especially during critical periods of time where extensive epigenetic
reprogramming occurs. In particular, it would be inadvisable to prescribe these
treatments to pregnant mothers (including a few months before conception) as a
lot of reprogramming happens in early child development as well as during the
formation of gametes (both male and female).</span></p></div>
