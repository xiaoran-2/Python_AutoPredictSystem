    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are usually kept free of DNA methylation while the rest of the genome is methylated in the repeats, this happens because DNA methylation is associated to silencing and repeats need to be silenced to mantain genomic stability. In cancer there are two abnormalities that can happen, CpG hypermethylation and genome hypomethylation, when CpG islands are hypermethylated genes that should not be silenced are silenced. This can lead to cancer when tumour suppressor genes are silenced. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements need to be silenced to mantain genomic stability, but hypomethylation of this elements causes reciprocal translocations and illegitimate silencing of repeats and this can lead to cancer in the cell. Lack of DNA methylation genome wide can also cause the activation of certain oncogene, or growth genes, that would make the cell reproduce out of control and turn cancerous.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the H19/lgf2 cluster the paternal allele's imprint control region (ICR) is methylated while the maternal allele's ICR is unmethylated. The maternal allele's ICR is able to bind to the CTCF protein since it's unmethylated which allows the enhancers to act on H19 leaving lgf2 silenced. On the other hand CTCF cannot bind to the paternal allele's ICR and the enhancers end up acting on lgf2 activating it. In Wilm's tumour in both alleles are methylated which leads to overexpression of lgf2, this disruption contributes to cancer because lgf2 is a growth promoting gene and it is being overexpressed leading to the appeareance of a tumour. Just like in the H19/lgf2 cluster other imprinted genes can be hyper or hypomethylated leading to cancer, that is why loss of imprinting is one of the characteristics of cancer in its early stages (preneuplastic stages) </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is an epigenetic inhibitor that acts on DNA methyltranspherase which means that the drug demethylases the DNA by inhibiting the mantainance of methylation, since every time a cell divides the new strand of DNA does not contain this epigenetic mark by stopping the mantainance of it the methylation is progressively lost. Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect in myelodysplastic syndromes because by demethylating the genome certain tumour supressor genes that have been silenced can be activated again and start stopping the tumour's uncontrolled growth and divisionBy a</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">By altering DNA methylation through drugs genes can be silenced or activated in a cells epigenome. If a cancer cell can be stopped from dividing by using drugs that alter DNA methylation the changes would be lasting since the cancerous cell division would be slowed and DNA methylation is usually lost progressively through cell division therefore the effects would last on the cell. Drugs would also affect the non cancerous cells that tend to divide much more slowly meaning  that the effect of the cell would also endure on the healthy cells until they get to replicate, but this side effects of the drugs can be particularly dangerous in sensitive periods. Sensitive periods are periods where the epiginome is specially susceptible to environmental changes and can have a later effect on epigenetic control. Humans have two sensitive periods, primordial germ cell development and pre implantation to post early pre implantation period, where taking any of this drugs could severely alter the way this cells later control their epiginome. For example taking a DNMTi while young with developing gametes could have the next generation to have an unstable genome since its sells are hypomethylated. </div>
