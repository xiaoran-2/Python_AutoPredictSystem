    <h1>Submission 608 from Anon (session_user_id: 2dca5878cba71d4959fe4d4c106dc1af9bfec916)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated in cancer, which can turn off the expression of tumor suppressor genes. (CpG islands that are unmethylated are transcriptionally active, generally.) <br /><br />In contrast, intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be hypomethylated in cancer. Normally they are methylated to maintain genomic integrity. Without this methylation, undesired recombination and other chromosomal aberrations can occur, which will contribute to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normally, the paternal allele is methylated at the ICR, which prevents insulator binding, which in turn allows enhancers to promote IGF-2 expression, while preventing H19 expression. In the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated, which means that CTCF can be insulated, which prevents enhancer interaction with IGF-2 (thus preventing expression) and allows expression of H19.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumor, the maternal allele is methylated, thus you get a double dose of IGF-2, and are lacking H19 expression. IGF-2 is growth-promoting, and can contribute to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue DNMT inhibitor. Decitabine causes the hypomethylation of DNA. It can reduce methylation at CpG islands, thus allowing the expression of tumor suppressor genes, for example.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. A sensitive period is one where epigenetic marks are being actively established / remodelled. The sensitive periods of development are primordial germ cell development and pre-implantation development. It would be inadvisable to treat patients during sensitive periods, since these modifications could be passed on the further generations, or have long-term effects on the patient that are unknown.</div>
