    <div class="field-value"><div>RNA polymerase starts transcribing DNA all around in a a randomly way. Once the cell has finite resources, a non methylated DNA would consume a lot of time and energy from the cell, transcribing unwanted and possible harmful random DNA. The methylation at CpG islands form a 5-methylcytosine changing the expression and therefore knock out that possible garbage located in intergenic regions and repetitive elements on the DNA.</div><div>In cancer cells, has been found that the balance is disrupted having a hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes and hypomethylation of oncogenes witch could promote mitotic recombination and chromosome rearrangement. The balance is lost, the cell replicate indefinitely and the original methylation configuration is lost resulting in more disrupted DNA.<br />source: [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CpG_site">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CpG_site</a>] [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23686312" title="Link: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23686312">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23686312</a>] [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_methylation" title="Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_methylation">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_methylation</a>][<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_epigenetics">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_epigenetics</a>]</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>In a normal person, IGF2 is active on paternal and inactive on maternal but in Wilms’tumour the maternal also express IGF2 resulting in a double dosage.</div><div>In maternal, CTCF is unmethylated, alowing it to bind to the insulator, this allow enhancers to act on H19 resulting in a silent IGF2. In paternal, CTCF is methylated, therefore enhancer can act on IGF2 resulting in expression.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Decitabine is a member of the class of epigenetic inhibitors called DNA-demethylating agents. Its used in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome demethylating the area responsable for transcribing the suppressor genes. As a result the control over cell growth can be restored. <br />It also interact with the cell producing a cytotoxic effect that causes death of rapidly dividing cancer cells.</div><div>source: [<a href="http://chemocare.com/chemotherapy/drug-info/decitabine.aspx" title="Link: http://chemocare.com/chemotherapy/drug-info/decitabine.aspx">http://chemocare.com/chemotherapy/drug-info/decitabine.aspx</a>]</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>The reason why DNA methylation can have enduring effects its because epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division, therefore any change can least till all actively methylation are erased.</div><div>There are some know sensitive period, for example on early life during primordial cell development and early embryonic development, when there is an increase sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanism, furthermore, there are also times when IVF or ICSI can be effectively disruptive later in life. Thats why would be inadvisable to prescribe treatments to pregnant mothers, as a lot of reprogramming happens during this time on the formation of gametes.</div><div><br /><div>source: [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22920183">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22920183</a>]</div></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>
