    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are found in about 60% of promoter regions in Vertebrates. These islands are usually not methylated and thus usually enable the gene to be expressed. <br />In cancer, methylation of CpG islands and CpG island shores is increased. This can lead to silencing of genes such as tumour suppressor genes. With their suppression cancer cells are able to multiply unchecked. <br />Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are often due to viral or transposible elements. These regions are usually highly methylated thus suppressing the expression of harmful DNA. This hypermethylation makes the genome more stable. <br />In Cancer the DNA methylation in these regions is decreased. In other words they are hypomethylated. This can lead to these repetivitive regions recombining with other regions of long repeats on different chromosomes. These reciprical translocations can disrupt normal genomic activity. . This can occur because the hypomethylation and the open chromatin structure (euchromatin) can lead to misalignment of chromosomes. Repeats can make a copy of themselves and jump around the genome. This can disrupt a gene or lead to promoters that may activate neighbouring genes. Overall he hypomethylation leads to genomic instability giving rise to a higher number of insertions, deletions and recombinations in the chromosomes. <br />Some tumours are driven by chromosomal instability. An example of this in humans is when a mutation in DNMT3B leads to <span>immunodeficiency and facial anomalies syndrome (ICF)</span>. The hypomethylation is a characteristic feature of it in repeats around the centromere. In mouse models it has been demonstrated that deleting Dnmt1 in specific tissues which leads to hypomethylation and will result in genomic instability and cancer. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is in a class of inhibitors called DNA demethylating agents or hypomethylating agents. It is a DNMTi which targets an enzymatic regulator called DNA demethyltransferase (DNMT). <br />Decitabine is incorporated into the DNA during replication and then binds irreversibly to DNA DMT during active cell replication. Inhibition of DNMT, means that when a cell divides the hemimethylated DNA will not receive the new methyl markers. The drug, therefore, decreases the methylation in the CpG islands.<br />The hypomethylation leads to expression of genes such as the tumour suppressor genes that had been silenced in the cancer. When these genes are activated they control cellular differentiation and proliferation, thus leading to a slowed growth of the tumour. It has been approved for use in Myelodysplastic syndrome which has progressed to AML. <br />There may be other mechnisms behind how it works but they are not yet understood.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The normal methylation pattern in the paternal allele for the H19/IGf2  is for the imprinting control region (ICR) to be methylated. This prevents binding of the CTCF on the ICR. Without the CTCF, DNA methylation spreads from the ICR to the H19 promoter and silences it. This means that enhancers,(lncRNA),  activate the Igf2 leading to its expression. <br />In contrast the ICR on the maternal allele is unmethylated, enabling the CTCF to bind to the ICR. This insulates the IgF2 from the downstream enhancers, leading to Igf2 not being expressed, and instead H19 is expressed. <br />In Wilm's tumour, a childhood renal cancer, there is also methylation at the ICR on the maternal allele. This prevents the CTCF binding and leads, like the paternal allele, to the expression of Igf2 instead of H19. <br />The loss of imprinting control leads to double the dose of Igf2. Igf2 codes for Insulin-like growth factor 2. This leads to a stimulation of growth of the tumour cells. It also may have a role in preventing the damaged cells from being destroyed.  </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Changes to DNA methylation are mitotically heritable, being passed on to the daughter cells of subsequent generations. <br />The sensitive period in epigenetics is a time in which epigenetic markers are reprogrammed.  <br />These two sensitive periods include the time of primordial cell development and the early embryo development. <br />Widespread demethylation and remethylation of maternal and paternal chromosomes occurs during the sensitve periods. Treatment by drugs could result in abnormalities in both clearing and/or resetting of marks. This will change gene expression. <br />If a demethylation treatment is given during primordial germ cell development then changes to imprinted genes can occur. This could lead to a gene being expressed from both the maternal or paternal chromosome due to a loss of imprinting. Conversely, a drug that increases methylation may result in both maternal and paternal imprinted genes being methylated. This could lead to the overexpression of a gene. As imprinted genes usually influence growth this can have marked influences on embryo viability and normal development. <br />Demethylating drugs could also reduce the remethylation of the repeats (IAP). Although they are mostly protected from demethylation during the sensitve periods there are some that are demethylated. Non-methylation of repeats has serious consequences on genomic stability.</div>
