    <div class="field-value">To understand how the DNA methylation is altered in cancer, we must first understand what DNA methylation and CpG islands are. Our DNA is made up of four different bases, these being cytosine, guanine, adenine and thymine. DNA methylation, so the adding of methyl groups to the DNA, frequently occurs in the fifth position of a cytosine that is linked with guanine, hence the CpG (Cytosine-Phosphate-Guanine). A cluster of these CpGs at a promoter of a gene is called a CpG island, which is usually unmethylated in a healthy cell. In contrast, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated in a healthy cell. When found at promoters, they tend to cause the silencing of the gene and play an important role in maintaining genomic stability. <br />In cancer cells however we find the reverse. CpG islands are usually hypermethylated and the underlying gene, often tumor suppressor genes, therefore silenced, while the intergenic regions and their repetitive elements tend to be unmethylated. Because of this, these intergenic regions and the repetitive elements can no longer uphold the genomic stability, as deletions, reciprocal translocations and insertions are more common.<br />This begs the question whether or not using DNMTi to stop the methylation of DNA is a wise treatment option. To decide this, one has to look at the specific tumor at hand. In cases where the tumor seems to profit from hypermethylation of CpG islands, so from the lack of tumor suppressor genes, a treatment with DNMTi would be advisable. If however the tumor is profiting from the chromosomal instability caused by the hypomethylation of intergenic regions and their repetitive elements, a treatment with DNMTi would be likely to enhance tumorgenesis.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">When there is a change in the way the DNA is methylated at ICRs (Imprint Control Regions), so either hyper- or hypomethylation, we find that there are two possible results, the first being that both the maternal and paternal gene get expressed, or that neither gets expressed. Due to these changes often happening around genes responsible for growth, we then find excessive expression of-genes growth or a loss thereof.<br />In a healthy, normal cell the ICR is methylated on the paternal allele, but unmethylated on the maternal allele. Thus CTFC can bind to the maternal allele, allowing, through the enhancers, for H19 to be expressed, while Igf2 is not expressed. On the paternal allele we find the opposite, since the ICR is methylated. Thus the enhancers enable the expression of Igf2, rather than that of H19.<br />In the case of cancer, in particular Wilm's tumor, we find hypermethylation at ICR, causing the maternal allele to, like the paternal allele, express Igf2 rather than H19. As Igf2 is growth promoting, children suffering from this epigenetic alteration often develop a so called Wilm's tumor. It seems that generally, a disruption of imprinting is an early event in tumorgenesis.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine inhibits DNA methyltransferase (DNMTi) and therefore classes as a hypomethylating agent. It is used to treat acute myeloid leukemia in order to prevent the cancer cells from growing and spreading. After Decitabine has been built into the DNA, it can irreversably bind to DNMT1 when this tries to methylate the daughter DNA-Strand after mitosis, therefore leading to one stand not being methylated. Due to cancer cells (containing a high amount of methylated regions) dividing much more frequently than other cells in our body, it is in these tumor cells that we see great effect. In their rapid mitosis, they lose methylated regions and thus multiply less frequently and become more stable. However, Decitabine is a perfect example for more not always being better, since in this case the DNMTi becomes too toxic for the body, whereas a lower dosage will result in a higher, desired anti-neoplastic effect.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">As can be seen in Question 3, drugs like Decitabine that act as an inhibitor to DNA methytransferase (DNMTi) irreversibly demethylate the DNA. This is good in the case of epigenetic alterations as seen in acute myeloid leukemia, but there is nonetheless a danger in that all cells are effected by these drugs. Therefore, if a healthy cell is dividing and DNMTi causes the demethylation of the daughter strand of DNA, and then the complete demethylation of the f2 generation, there is a chance of chromatic instablility due to hypomethylisation in an otherwise healthy area. <br />A sensitive period is a time when the epigenetic state is particularly sensitive to environmental effects. Such a period can be observed during germ cell development and early embryonic development. As these epigenetic changes, especially DNA methylation, are mitotically stable in somatic cells, it is important not to cause epigenetic alterations in these sensitive periods. Especially when a young person is still developing germ cells, the usage of these drugs is inadvisable as any changes made by this drug in this sensitive period is likely to be heritable. That is why the usage of Decitabine is only suggested for people of age 65 and over.</div>
