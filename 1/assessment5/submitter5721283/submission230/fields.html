    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands (CGIs) is the silencing of gene expression, primarily by the formation of a repressive chromatin structure but also through the prohibition of transcription factor binding. Active genes are not normally methylated at GCIs. </p><p>In cancer DNA methylation of CGIs occurs at genes which are not normally methylated, or genes which are normally methylated become unmethylated. Methylation at CGIs turns off tumour suppressor genes which are normally unmethylated and therefore active. On the other hand demethylation of oncongenes which are normally methylated, activates them. Methylation can happen in sets of genes and this is known as CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP).</p><p>Normally intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated to provide genomic stability and prevent loss or gain of chromosomes, or illegitimate re-combination  between chromosomes. In cancer intergenic regions and repetitive elements become unmethylated. This loss of methylation at these regions causes genomic instability and can allow re-combination between repeats, the activation of repeats, transposition or the activation of cryptic promoters with the consequent disruption of neighbouring genes and/or transcriptional aberrations. This loss in one or all of its forms may lead to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinted genes are those whose expression is allele specific to the parent of origin. In IGF2, in humans, the paternal allele is expressed and the maternal allele is silenced and not expressed.</p><p>On the paternal allele methylation of the imprint control region (ICR) block CTCF binding, silences the H19 promoter and allows activation of IGF2 transcription by the downstream enhancers. On the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated which allows binding of CTCF and expression of H19 because of the action of the enhancers on H19and not IGF2 which is therefore silenced.</p><p>In Wilm's tumour both paternal and maternal ICR's are methylated, CTCF binding is blocked, H19 silenced and therefore the downstream enhancers act to express IGF2 on both alleles. As IGF2 is a growth promoter expression from both alleles results in overexpression of this growth factor, the accumulation of pre-neoplastic tissue and ultimately neoplasia.</p><p><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an FDA approved DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi), referred to in "Cancer's Epicentre" as a DNA demethylating agent. It is approved for the treatment of Myelodyspastic syndrome which progresses to Acute Myeloid Lymphoma. It acts to inhibit DNA methylation of tumour genes thereby allowing normal expression of the genes to prevent tumourigenisis.</p><p>The anti-tumour effect is achieved because Decitibine is a nucleoside analogue that incorporates into the DNA structure and irreversibly binds to the enzyme DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) and so inactivates it, preventing it from methylating DNA. Because the binding is permanent its effects are replicated during cell division. Decitibine therefore keeps the tumour suppressor gene(s) active by inhibiting their methylation and they remain active against tumourigenisis. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic mark passed on mitotically and so endures in the epigenome, eg  in the case of X chromosome inactivation, imprinting and the formation of heterochromatin. Changes in DNA methylation including genome-wide hypomethylation and region specific hypermethylation cause genomic instability and lead to cancers.</p><p>Mouse studies of the Agouti viable yellow allele indicate DNA methylation is unlikely to be an inherited epigenetic mark. However studies of the plant <i>Linaria vulgaris </i>suggest phenotype variation caused by heritable DNA methylation of the Lcyc gene. </p><pre><code></code></pre><p>A sensitive period is where epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation are being reset during mitotic and meiotic division and during tissue remodelling processes. The two sensitive periods are primordial germ cell and germ cell development and early embryonic development. There can be reprogramming differences between the two periods. For example imprinted genes undergo reprogramming in primordial germ cells but not in early development.</p><p>Treating patients during sensitive periods may result in the incomplete resetting of epigenetic marks, including DNA methylation. It is also know that epigenetic patterns are initially established as a consequence of developmental cues (Hassler and Egger, 2012). Younger patients may therefore be particularly susceptible to treatment during germ cell development. <br /></p></div>
