    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to a
class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, and thus contributes to
hypomethylation of DNA. This turns out to be particularly useful in treating
myelodysplatic syndromes, the procursors of acute myelogenous leukemia. The impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.It does not repair the DNA, but it deals with the damage caused by cancer by finding the broken-genes . A lot of lymphomas-cancer of the immune system are caused by mutations that make WZH2 over active. Such over activity methylates histone more than they should and thus silences the genes they surround, including so-called tumor-suppressor genes whose his is to stop the uncontrolled cell growth that causes cancer. the Dacitabine anti­tumour effect has been
linked to reactivation of epigenetically silenced tumor supressor genes,
induced by the hypothemylation.<br /> [1]<br />1.- Magazine article: (2012, 7th April). <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" title="Link: http://www.economist.com/node/21552168">Cancer's epicentre</a>. The Economist.<br /><br /><p> </p><br /></div>

    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal DNA: CpG promoter islands
are hypomethylated. DNA Methylation of promoter regions inversely
correlates with gene expresion. Exception are the islands, wich are found in
about 60% of promoters. They have high CpG density and are usually kept free of
methylation indepent of their activity state. In Cancer cells CpG islands are more likely to be hypermethylated, this
leads to problems as tumor suppressor genes may become silenced, allowing the
cell to divide more rapidly, outcompete its neighboring cells, and grow into a
tumour. The intragenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated in
normal DNA and in cancer cells these regions are hypomethylated. Hypomethylation
during cancer leads to copying errors such as deletions, insertions and
reciprocal translocations in the chromosomes. Changes in the patern of DNA methylation: Is a
strong candidate for introducing errors in the system as it is mitotically
heritable [1].</p><p>1.- Review article: Hassler MR, Egger G. (2012). <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3480634/">Epigenomics of cancer - emerging new concepts</a><span>. Biochimie, 94(11):2219-30</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;

        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;

    <div class="field-value"><p>In paternal cells  the H19/Igf2 alleles
are methylated  at the ICR, and in maternal
cells  the H19/Igf2 alleles are not methylated
 at the ICR. The CTCF complex binds to
the allele on the maternal strand and the downstream enhancers act on H19 as a
result. Due to the methyl marks, the CTCF complex does not bind to the paternal
allele which leads to silencing of the H19 gene as the enhancers instead drive
expression of Igf2. ICRs
are associated with sequences that carry imprinting marks (IMs), which are
epigenetic modifications that distinguish the parental alleles. At theH19/Igf2<span> locus, the ICR is associated with the
paternally methylated 2-kb differentially methylated domain (DMD) upstream of </span>H19. The DMD, which is located 2 kb 5′ of H19<span> and approximately 90 kb 3′ of </span>Igf2, is a CTCF-dependent, methylation-sensitive
insulator that blocks enhancer-driven Igf2expression on the hypomethylated maternal allele and
functions as a silencing element to repress H19 expression on the hypermethylated
paternal allele.<span> In Wilms tumour,

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.

    <div class="field-value"><p>1.- Describe
how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome.</p>

<p>The
pattern in question is that many of the genes whose breakage leads to cancer
are themselves involved in a specific sort of genetic regulation, known as epigenetics.
This switches genes an and off by plastening either their DNA or the protein
wich support that DNA in chromosomes with clusters of atoms called methyl  and acetyl groups. Critical periods ­­ periods are
considered when extensive epigenetic reprogramming occurs. In particular, it
would be inadvisable to prescribe these treatments to pregnant mothers
(including a few months before conception), early child development as well as
during the formation of gametes (both male and female)</p><p></p><p>Magazine article: (2012, 7th April). <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168">Cancer's epicentre</a>. The Economist.<br /></p><p></p></div>
