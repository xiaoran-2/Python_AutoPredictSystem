    <h1>Submission 443 from Anon (session_user_id: 762a20ef8caa84df41b1fd63867c4632418510d2)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to a class of drugs known as hypomethylating agents, drugs that inhibit DNA methylation by blocking the activity of <span>DNA methyltransferase (DNMT inhibitors).<br /></span><br />Decitabine blocks the activity of DNMT that can cause hypermethylation which can inactivate genes essential for the control of normal cell growth, differentiation or apoptosis. <span>This action allows for the re-expression of tumor suppressor genes.<br /><br /></span>Studies have shown that Decitabine activity is dose dependant and at lower doses, it induces hypomethylation, thereby promoting cell differentiation, re-expression of tumor suppressor genes, stimulation of immune mechanisms, and suppression of tumor growth. At higher doses it is cytotoxic.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In cancer cells there we can observe a general genome-wide hypomethylation with regions of tumor suppressing genes that are hypermethylated.<br /><br />CpG islands are usually hypomethylated in normal cells. These are regions of DNA where many promoter regions of the gene are located and are essential in gene expression. <br /><br />In many cancer cells CpG islands are hypermethylated resulting in the silencing of tumour suppressor genes. In various types of cancers, tumour suppressor hypermethylation is often more
frequent than mutations and it is mitotically heritable.<br /><br />In normal cells <span>intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually hypermethylated. <br /></span><br />On the other hand, in cancer cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated.<br /><br />DNA hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements in cancer cells leads to genomic instability, causing a variety of aberrations including illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation and transposition of repeats, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to
neighbouring genes.<br /><br />Epigenetic abnormalities in cancer cells cause the activation of oncogenes and the inactivation of tumour suppressors. This has as a consequence the abnormal growth and proliferation of cancer cells.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">On the paternal allele the imprint control region (IRC) is methylated unable the CTCF insulating protein to bind to that region resulting enhancers activating the Igf2 gene. The methylation of IRC can spread downstream causing also the methylation of the promoter region of H19 effectively silencing it.<br /><br />On the maternal allele, the IRC is unmethylated causing the CTCF insulating protein to bind to that region. The binding  of the CTCF protein to the  ICR insulates the <span>Igf2 from the downstream enhancers. The enhancers are now free to act on the H19 and enhance its expression on the maternal allele.<br /><br />In </span>Wilm’s tumour th maternal allele behaves like paternal allele and you essentially have two paternal alleles. This results by the loss of the tumour suppressor Cdkn1c and upregulation of the growth promoting oncogene Igf2.<span><br /><br />Disruption of imprinting at the </span>H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer by over expression of Igf2, which leads to growth promotion and underexpression of tumour suppressor Cdkn1c, which leads to the absence of growth inhibition.<span><br /> </span><span class="_wysihtml5-temp"></span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome as DNA methylation, including histone methylation and piRNAeffects,  is mitotically heritable.<br /><br />A sensitive period is a period of time where there is active remodelling of the genome, the removal and laying down of epigenetic marks at different places of the genome.<br /><br />There are two sensitive periods of development; the period from germ cell developement all the way to the production of gametes (mature eggs and sperm) and the pre-implantaion and early post-implantaion period.<br /><br /><span>Treating patients during sensitive periods would be highly inadvisable as in these periods there is an active remodelling of the genome.  Any disruption of this process by drugs that inhibit the epigenetic machinery would be highly risky and should not be done. <br /></span>This is particularly true for younger patients with germ cell development still ongoing as these drugs are used trough the system and could potentially effecting every cell and sensitive periods should also be avoided.<br /><br /><br /></div>
