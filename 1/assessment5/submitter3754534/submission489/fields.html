    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>DNA methylation is being significantly changed in cancer.</div><div>In normal cell, CpG islands often are hypomethylated and play a role of gene promoters. Methylation at those CpG islands serves the gene silencing. In cancer, CpG islands are hypermethylated which may lead to silencing of tumor suppressors.</div><div>Methylation of both intergenic regions and repetitive elements aims at various kinds of genomic integrity in normal cell. Such integrity is going to be disrupted in cancer due to demethylation of those DNA parts, allowing different aberrations (e.g. deletions, insertions or translocations) to appear.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Disruption of imprinting may cause abnormal growth like it does in case of Wilm's tumor.</div><div>In normal case, ICR on the paternal allele is methylated which silences H19 expression and allows enhancers to activate Igf2, whereas ICR on the maternal allele, being unmethylated, allows enhancers to activate H19 and keep Igf2 inactive.</div><div>In case of Wilm's tumor, ICR on the maternal allele is methylated which breaks imprinting and leads to doubled growth-promoting Igf2 expression.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor and, being incorporated into DNA, prevents DNA methyltransferase from copying methylation factors to the daughter chromosome. This leads to getting cancer cells much more affected since they divide faster than normal cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Being a heritable epigenetic factor, DNA methylation determines phenotype in a great extent.</div><div>That fact has to be considered to prevent DNA methylation being disrupted by drugs in sensitive periods which are periods of epigenetic reprogramming (i.e. pre-implantation early development period and primordial germ cells development period).</div><div>Pregnant or young patients must be treated with caution to avoid bringing a damage to the next generation.</div></div>
