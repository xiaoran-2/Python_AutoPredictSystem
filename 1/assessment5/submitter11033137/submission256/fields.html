    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>With this cluster, we know that the
function of CTCF (an insulator protein) is essential for the expression of
lgf2. CTCF insulates lgf2 from downstream enhancers. Without CTCF DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter
to silence, and enhancers can access lgf2 to activate it.<br /></p>

<p>The ICR at IGF2 and H19 is normally methylated
on the paternal allele. Methylation is excluded from the maternal allele by
CTCF binding. The presence of CTCF confers an insulator function upon the ICR,
which blocks access of the IGF2 promoters to the enhancers downstream of the
H19 gene. </p>

<p>Wilms' tumour, imprinted expression of <i>IGF2</i> is commonly relaxed resulting in maternal allele expression. This is associated with increased methylation and reduced expression from the maternal copy of the tightly linked <i>H19</i> locus. IGF2 is normally only transcribed from
the paternal allele, this maternal imprinting is lost in many tumors, leading
to biallelic expression of the gene. </p><p>Loss of IGF2 imprinting may also be seen in normal
tissue adjacent to the tumor, suggesting that loss of IGF2 imprinting leads to
an oncogenic diathesis that enhances the risk for neoplastic transformation.<br /></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><i>1. CpG
islands are usually kept free of methylation </i>independent of their activity
state, but most cancers also show focal hypermethylation in distinct subsets of
promoter associated CpG islands and these aberrant de novo hypermethylation occurring in transformed cells serves as an alternative mechanism for inactivation of tumour suppressor genes.<i> </i>Affected
genes are permanently silenced, since methylation marks are propagated through
mitosis and are maintained in the malignant clone. So if you think that actually silencing a tumour suppressor is going to allow that particular cell to have a competitive advantage over the others in the surrounding tissues, then over a period, the cells that have these epimutations are more likely to dived more rapidly, therefore, they will take occur and this is indeed how cancer is eventuate.<br /><br />2. The intergenic regions and the repetitive elements are normally silencing, avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters. Methylation of repeats may prevent illegitimate recombination, so DNA methylation must also be benefit, protect the genome from transposable elements and it mostly occurs at repeats. But in cancer, as a general rule these regions tend to
become hypomethylated, less methylation than in a
normal cell.

<p>In
cancer, we have hypomethylation of these repetitive elements or the intergenic
regions. They align, they misalign, and then an illegitimate recombination can
occur. We know
that these repeats ca also be activated because of the hypomethylation. This
means that the repeats have the capacity to actually make a copy of themselves
and jump around the genome or transpose. </p><p>This can result in consequent problems
where they may disrupt the coding region of a
gene or it also may activate neighboring genes. <br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase, <span>it is a hypomethylating agent</span>. Decitabine acts by
removing inhibitory methyl groups from the cytosine residues of promoter
sequences, which presumably restores downstream gene transcription. Theoretically,
the reversal of these changes could lead to reexpression of silenced tumor
suppressor genes and inhibit cancer cell progression.</p>

<p>Decitabine inhibits DNMT, depletes DNMT1 through
proteosomal degradation, induces global DNA hypomethylation, and increases
expression of specific genes through mechanisms both dependent on as well as
independent of promoter hypomethylation, and this is because patterns of DNA methylation are stable
during cellular division. Hypomethylating agents decrease the
amount of cellular DNA methylation and disrupt these patterns.</p>

<p>The available data suggests that
decitabine is able to reduce DNA methylation in solid tumors, and in addition secondary exploratory analyses, suggest that decitabine increases
apoptosis, it may also enhance proliferation by up-regulating progrowth
signaling pathways. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA
methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because the epigenetic changes are mitotically
heritable. Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter
and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though,
they do not return.</p>

<p>Sensitive periods
are the periods when changes in environment are going to have the biggest
effect (when the environment may be able to influence epigenetic make up) while
epigenetic reprograming is occurring (these periods are active remodelling of
the epigenome).</p>

<p>The periods
of primordial germ cell development (all the way through to the production of
maternal eggs and sperm) is one sensitive periods, the second sensitive
period is the preimplantation period in early post implantation period.</p>

<p>Treating patients
during sensitive period would be inadvisable because we do not know the effects of these drugs if they
are given to a very young child (when the sensitive periods are happened: when the production of maternal eggs and sperm are happened), and we don't know the effects of these drugs
should they be given to a pregnant woman. We would expect potentially serious
side effects to the fetus, because we could alter the epigenetic marks that should normally be there.</p>
