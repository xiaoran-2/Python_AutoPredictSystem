    <h1>Submission 481 from Anon (session_user_id: 79657a8a3a97d06955fab346248769782580f058)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Decitabine belongs to the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) class. </li><li>It is being nucleoside analogue inhibits DNA methylation by binding irreversibly and gets incorporated into DNA. With quite higher dose it has been found to be toxic to the body during initial drug trials. However, with low dose it results in DNA demethylation. So it has been approved by FDA for the treatment of Myeloblastic syndrome progressed to AML. </li><li>Though the exact molecular mechanism for the anti tumor effect of Decitabine is not known, it is considered that it leads to hypomethylation at CpG islands which are generally hypermethylated in Myeloblastic syndrome. Fortunately, it has no or very less side effects which makes it good candidate to treat Myeloblastic syndrome.<br /></li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands can be explained as in normal cell the CpG islands are hypomethylated  which helps the cell to express tumor suppressor genes in contrast to the cancer cell. </li><li>In cancer, CpG islands and CpG island shores of tumor supressor genes are hypermethylated in contrast with normal cell.  </li><li>DNA methylation at  CpG islands being mitotically heritable it helps in rapid progression of cancer. It is an alternative to the genetic mutation, to silence tumor suppressor genes in cancer. It can be the one of the hits in the Knudsosn hypothesis. Moreover, epimutations being more likely to be selected results into cancer.<br /></li><li>In normal cell the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated and so falls into the heterochromatin region making the genes within less likely to be expressed. </li><li>However, in cancer these intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated. </li><li>Although, the consequence of hypomethylation at <span>intergenic regions and repetitive elements depends on location it results in genomic instability leading to cancer. </span>Genomic instability may results because of illegitimate recombination between repeats or activation of repeats and transposition. It may also lead to activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighboring genes. </li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>In normal cell Igf2/H19 cluster, the imprint control region is methylated on the paternal allele, so  the enhancers can act on Igf2, because CTCF is not binding to inhibit this, and IGF2 is expressed.</li><li> However, in Igf2/H19 cluster  the imprint control region is unmethylated on the maternal allele. When it's unmethylated CTCF will binds this insulator element, which cause enhancers in this
case to act on H19. But Igf2 will be silent for the maternal allele, so there will be no expression.</li><li>However, with loss of imprinting because of hypermethylation of the imprint control
region on the maternal allele as well, on the maternal allele results in the expression of Igf2. This makes the double dose of
Igf2 in comparison to what is observed in a normal cell.  Igf2 is
growth promoting, and is associated with Wilms’ tumour. </li><li>Igf2 being growth promoting and double dose of or its over-expression  results in cancer known as Wilms’ tumour<br /><p><br /></p></li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Epigenetic changes like DNA methylation are mitotically heritable. They are passed on during cell division to the daughter and grand daughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased they they do not return. Thus epigenetic therapy like altering DNA methylation can have enduring effect on the epigenome which stops cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.</li><li>Sensitive periods are the critical time period during development when the epigenetic marks are established rather than maintained. </li><li> Sensitive periods are during embryogenesis and gametogenesis when the epigenetic marks are established rather than maintained. </li><li>Treating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable as at this time point the epigenetic marks are established newly. Moreover, chances of mutation during gametogenesis are more and that may be carried over to the next generations through germ line. Specially, recently common cancer treatments like chemotherapy and radiotherapy results in depletion of germ cells. </li></ul></div>
