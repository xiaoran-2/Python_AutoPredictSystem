    <h1>Submission 624 from Anon (session_user_id: a7c682aceee717392bd1ff969c18b0375cce3705)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the new class of drugs known as DNA Demethylation Agents. Methylation of DNA is a Mechanism that regulates gene expression in our cells,  so when DNA methylation shows an increase pattern this can result in the blockage of the activity of suppressor genes that regulate cell division and growth, when this suppressor genes are blocked the cell division process becomes unregulated, allowing or promoting cancer. The Demethylation drugs can change the pattern of expression of genes that depends on the effect of chemotherapeutic agents , turning tumor cells more sensitive to exposure them.  <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The demethylation drugs can change the pattern of expression of genes so that genes recovered upon which the chemotherapeutic effect, if the cell changes its epigenetic condition, this will be inherited to daughter cells and also show changes including sensitivities to drugs or similar agents. The sensitive periods of development are those in which tumor cells respond to chemotherapeutic agents even after changes in their own evolution, demethylation drugs prevents some genes are silenced and control the sensitivity. Periods of development when epigenetic mechanisms for normal cell differentiation are used,  are unsuitable for using these drugs.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">The processes of DNA methylation are essential for epigenetic gene expression phenomena. The methylation in the promoter regions are inversely related to the ability of expression of a given gene, meaning that the more methylated promoter be the ability of gene expression will be significantly decreased, but there is an exception in what is known as CpG islands present in approximately 60% of promoters which tend to be free of methylation independent its state of activity. In tumor cells the CpG have to be hypomethylated which can mean the silencing of some genes. Intragenic Methylation can be found as satellite debris retroviral sequences and insertion into human DNA methylation in the body of the gene is present in highly expressed genes and this can lead to a repression of transcription at alternative sites. There is also hypomethylation in regulatory elements that bind to the specific transcription factors.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
