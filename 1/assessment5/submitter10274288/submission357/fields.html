    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation refers to the addition of a methyl (-CH3) group to the base cytosine(C) in the dinucleotide  5'CpG-3'. DNA methylation is an important component in many cellular processes, including embryonic development, genomic imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, and preservation of chromosome stability. DNA methylation regulates gene expression by recruiting proteins involved in gene repression or by inhibiting the binding of transcripitional factor(s) to DNA, In general, in normal cells we find the CpG islands are hypomethylated, and the intergenic regions, introns and repetitive elements are hypermethylated. In cancer cells, we find the pattern is reversed. The CpG islands are more likely to be hypermethylated and the intergenic regions, introns and repetitive elements are hypomethylated.  DNA methylation at CpG islands is normally associated with gene silencing.  In general, CpG islands are unmethylated and typically find at the promoters of genes.In cancer cells, this CGI hypermethylation at the promoters of tumour suppressor genes can inactivate these genes genetically or epigentically by silencing the tumour suppressor genes. Because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, the epimutation is a very effective way to silence the tumour suppressor gene. This allows the tumour to grow and out compete the neighbouring cells.As cancer progressess, we found increased methylation of the regions surrounding these CpG islands.The function of DNA methylation at intergenic regions is to maintain genomic integrity.In cancer cells, there is genome-wide hypomethylation leads to genomic instability. When there is genomic instability, we see a number of copying errors such as deletions, insertions, duplication of chromosomes, and trans-locations between chromosomes. This has serious consequences to the cells.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">H19 and Igf2 are two monoallelically expressed genes that are part of a cluster of imprinted genes. In normal cells, H19 is expressed from the paternal chromosome and Igf2 from the paternal. On the maternal allele, the imprinted control region (ICR) is unmethylated; this allows an insulator protein, CTCF, to bind. This binding insulate Igf2 from downstream enhancers to bind. These enhancers loop to H19 and enhance H19 expression in the maternal allele. On the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated,these enhancers can act on Igf2 and promote Igf2's expression from paternal allele. Therefore, Igf2 is only expressed from paternal and not maternal allele. In cancer cells, there is loss of imprinting. Genes that should display monallelic parent-of-origin specific expression no longer show this imprint of expression. They are either expressed from both parental alleles or silent from both parental alleles. The reason this is found in cancer is because lots of genes are either involved in growth promoting or growth suppressing. In Wilm's tumour, there is loss of imprinting and we have hypermethylation of ICR on the maternal allele, and expression of Igf2 as well. We end up with double dose of Igf2. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. It is a nucleotide analogue. It gets incorporated into DNA upon replication.DNA methyltransferase is bound irreversibly to the nucleotide and cannot be released. These DNA methyltransferase inhibitors are division dependent so we need cell replication. In cancer cells which are dividing more rapidly than normal cells would be severely affected  because they are replicating more.  Decitabine is FDA approved for use in myelodysplastic syndrome that has progressed to acute myeloid leukemia Methylation of DNA is a mechanism that regulates gene expression in cells .Hypermethylation can result in inactivation of suppressor genes as seen in cancer cells. The anti-tumour effect of decitabine is related to reactivation of epigenetically silenced tumour suppressor genes induced by hypomethylation.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, any change in DNA methylation pattern can have an enduring effects on the epigenome. These epigenetic marks are transmitted to daughter cells during cell division. Epigenetic drugs can incorporated into DNA upon replication. For example, DNA methyltransferase is bound irreversibly to the nucleotide and cannot be released. Thus, the effects would last beyond the period of drug treatment .Sensitive period is the period when epigenetic reprogramming occurs. This clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks in primordial germ cell development and early embryonic development. I would avoid treating patients with such drugs during these sensitive periods as epigenetic marks are being established. Inhibiting DNA mathylation can have a profound effects in the genome.Therefore,It is not advisable to give these drugs to pregnant women and young children .<br /></div>
