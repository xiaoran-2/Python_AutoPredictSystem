    <div class="field-value">In normal cells CpG island are methylated with low frequency. In a given tissue promoters of that tissue-specific genes have CpG islands that are non-methylated so they could express. Cancer cells are very often show so called CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) where CpG islands of sets of genes are heavily methylated especially including tumour-supressor genes. There are different distinct CIMPs in different tumours. Also in cancer often happens methylation of CpG-island shores that are regions which are located within 2 kb up and downstream of CpG islands. Methylation of tumour-supressors genes is heavily selected in cancers and is mithotically heritable which allows cancer cells to grow uncontrollable. <br />In normal cells intergenic regions and repititive elements are silenced via DNA methylation, but in cancer overall methylation level is lowered and unmethylated transposons and repeats are expressed what leads to genomic instability and sometimes activation of oncogenes that have poor CpG promoters.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the paternal allele Imprinting control region (ICR) is methylated which prevents it from binding with CTCF protein and lets enhacers which are located downstream of the ICR activate transcription of Insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2). In the maternal allele ICR is not methylated and is readily bound with CTCF which acts as insulator, preventing enhancers to activate Igf2. Instead of activating Igf2, enhacers activate transcription of H19 long noncoding RNA which role isn't yet determined but this lncRNA is connected with body weight decrease and may be antagonist of Igf2. It's worth noting that in the paternal allele H19 promoter is methylated which prevents it from activation by enhancers.<br />Patient with Wilm's tumour basically has two paternal allele. ICR in the maternal allele is also methylated as well as H19 promoter. There are two copies of active Igf2 which contribute to tumourogeneity due to their growth inducing properties and lack of supressing of that growth.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the DNA-demethylating agents as well as azacitidine. Decitabine inhibits DNA-methyltransferases and it can cause loss of DNA-methylation in the next generations of tumour cells. Demethylating properties of this drug can decrease aberrant methylation of CpG islands and CGI shores in the promoters of tumour-supressor genes, so that tumour-supressors could be reactivated in new cancer cells. Though decitabine cannot destroy cancer, it is able to slow down tumour growth, which can give some valuable time to patient.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable, so if you change them with the help of some drug they will remain altered even if the drug treatment is over. Sensitive period in terms of epigenetics is the period of clearing of epigenetic marks and reestablishment of them. There are two occurrences of such events in the development of mammals: during early embrionic development and during germ cell development since the primordial germ cells. Obviously, pregnant women must not be treated with epigenetic drugs because it can affect the health of their child (if drug is given at the time of the embrionic sensitive period) or even their grandchildren (if drug is given at the time of PGCs development of fetus). If men receive such medication they must be advised that the sperm which they produced during the treatment with the epigenetic drug may be affected by the drug and they shouldn't attempt to impregnate their spouses before finishing drug course and developing healthy unaffected sperm.<br /></div>
