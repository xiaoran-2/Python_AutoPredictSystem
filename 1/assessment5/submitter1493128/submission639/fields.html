    <h1>Submission 639 from Anon (session_user_id: 54cf1918f5f96b136a2f4f2d7f38b4a8642c035f)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Decitabine belongs to demethylation agents, it blocks
methylation of DNA. It may be used in patients whose hypermethylation CpG
islands of tumour-supressor genes have been detected. As CpG islands are
methylated in tumour cells, this drug can act by blocking methylation process
which leads to the restitution of expression of genes that are normally
repressed in cancer cases.    <span></span></span><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Disruption of imprinting can alter the
expression of a particular allele that is normally repressed, causing double
doses of expression of certain genes, as oncogenes, which results in cancer
development. In normal cases of H19/Igf2 cluster, Igf2 is maternally imprinting
which means that maternal allele is silenced; specifically, the Imprinting
Control Region (ICR) is unmethylated which allow the recruitment of a certain
protein and the Enhancer acts on H19 gene instead of Igf2. By contrast, the ICR
of this cluster at the paternal allele is methylated and the enhancer allows
the expression of Igf2 gene instead of H19. When the ICR of the maternal allele
is altered by hypermethylation causes a disease called Wilm’s tumour and is
characterized by a double doses of Igf2 expression. Double doses of gIf2 can
contribute to cancer as it codifies a protein that promotes cell growing.     <span> </span></span><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>CpG methylation is associated with repression of
genes; this is caused directly by the impossibility of transcription factors
binding to promoter genes or because methylation contributes with chromatin
package leading to genes repression. In normal cells, CpG islands are mostly
unmethylated which allows expression of genes. However, in tumour cells CpG islands
genes are find methylated leading to the repression of genes. When methylation
occurs at CpG located in promoter region of tumour-suppressor genes cancer can
appear, that is because tumour suppressors are involved in cell cycle
regulation by inhibiting this process, when absent, cell cycle progress quickly
giving rise to the development of tumour cells. Normally, intergenic region and
repetitive elements are methylated in the genome; this allows genomic stability
and inhibits jumping of these elements as transposons that can disrupt other
genes, also inhibits repetitive elements crossing-over. By contrast, in tumour
cells, those regions are unmethylated and lead to genome instability which can
contribute with cancer development. When unmethylated, repetitive elements can
cross-over producing alteration in genome; unmethylation of elements can also produce
mismatches of genome regions. Moreover, intergenic regions jump through the
genome, this process can lead insertions in other genes and can causes their disruption,
if those genes acts in cell cycle process, for example, it probably will have
implications on cancer development.   <span></span></span><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs for methylation are easily to treat than mutations. That is because mutations are not reversible, while methylation is. After treatment patients that have methylation with a particular drug, unmethylation and restitution of gene expression are possible. Sensitive period takes place early in development, in this moment epigenetics mechanisms take place and can change constantly, that is why drugs in  those period are not really effective. Instead of treating people at early stages of development, is better by far use drugs for methylation once those mechanisms are established    <br /></div>
