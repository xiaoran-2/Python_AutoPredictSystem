    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are a class of gene promoters that are usually not methylated, despite  of their high content in Cpg sites. The level of expression of genes controlled by Cpg islands are usually rather independent of the level of methylation. In many type of cancer, it has been observed an hypermethylation in Cpg islands, which induces inactivation of the associated genes. In particluar, the silencing of tumor supressor genes, or genes controlling DNA repair and apoptosis, is known to be important in tumorgenesis. For instance, a paritcular phenotype implying a high frequency of methylation is associated with colorectal cancers (CIMP, Cpg island methylator phenotype ). <br />In intergenic reigons and in repetive elements, DNA methylation ensure genomic stability. In interaction with other epgenetic mechanisms, DNA methylation maintain the integrity of the chromosomes, avoiding translocations and replications. In cancer, a genome-wide hypo-methylation is often observed, which leads to instability, and actuallly deregulation of imprinted genes (often associated with cell growth) and tissue specific genes. <br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The H19/Ifg2 cluster is on chromosome 11. It is under the control of a small impriting control region, which is unmethylated on the maternal allele, and methylated on the paternal allele. <br />On the maternal allele, an insulator protein (CTCF) binds the unmethylated region. As a result, the presence of the CTCF protein changes the DNA conformation: downstream enhancers are not allowed to reach the upstream gene Igf2, which becames inactivated. In parallel, the enhancing region can approach the H19 region that is activated. H19 is a noncoding RNA implied in microRNA production. <br />On the paternal allele, due to the methylation, CTCF cannot bind DNA. DNA looping can then make possible the encounter between the downstream enhancer and the upstream Igf2 gene, which is activated. In parallel, methylation spreads to the H19 region that is inactivated. <br />Disruption of the H19/Igf2 cluster and the adjacent region expressing  Cdkn1C, causes the Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome. The disruption leads to the presence of two paternal-like allelles, that over-express the growth promoting gene Igf2, and under-express the tumor supressor gene Cdkn1C. This leads to different symptons, in particular numerous tumors in affected children. One type of tumor is the Wilm's tumor, that affects kidneys.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a demethylating agent. Its action is to inhibit DNA methyltransferase. It is used  to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, a type of leukemia. It is likely that Decitabine reduces the hypermethylation in CpG islands, thus enhancing the expression of tumor supressors.  <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is chemically very stable. Furthermore, specific DNA repairs mechanisms and DNA replication maintain methylation during the life of a cell, but also ensure that methylation sites are conserved after mitosis and pass to daughter cells. Consequently, altering DNA methylation can stay long after the end of the treatment. The problem is that the maintenance of a correct methylation pattern in healthy (non tumor) cells is compromised if the treatment is not targeted to the tumor. In particular, early embryogenic development, and development of germ cells, are critical periods in which intense de-methylation re-methylation takes place. hese critical periods are sensitive to environmental changes: using a drug that modify methylation mechanism is not appropriate and cause severe problems.<br /></div>
