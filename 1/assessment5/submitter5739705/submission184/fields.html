    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The imprint control region (ICR) at the paternal allele is methylated. Therefore, binding of insulator proteins to the ICR is blocked. This leaves the enhancers free to act on their first choice mode of action, which is stimulating Igf2 gene expression. Because enhancers are acting on Igf2, they don't act on H19. And because of chromatin spreading, paternal H19 is also methylated.<br />The maternal ICR, on the other hand, is unmethylated. This means that the CTCF insilator protein can bind to the ICR. Enhancers are no longer able to act on Igf2, so instead they act on H19 to stimulate its expression. Furthermore, because the ICR is not methylated, there also is no chromatin spreading to H19.<br />In Wilm's tumour, los of imprinting results in hypermethylation of the H19/Igf2 cluster. Both paternal and maternal ICRs are methylated, causing the enhanceres to act on Igf2. This means that both alleles are expressing Igf2 (instead of only the paternal), resulting in overexpression of Igf2, which is involved in growth promotion. When growth is promoted, they are more likely to be selected for, giving them a change to grow, but also giving them a change to mutate further and become more mallignant.</div>

    <div class="field-value">CGs bases in the DNA are involved in mitotically heritable methylation. CpG islands are CG rich regions that are usually located at gene promotors. They are involved in gene activation/sillencing. In normal cells, these regions are protected against methylation and are therefore usually unmethylated. In cancer, these regions are more likely to be metylated (= hypermethylation of CpG islands). When a CpG island is methylated this corresponds to gene sillencing. When, in cancer, the promotors of tumor suppressor genes are silenced by methylation, the cell gains the ability to progress in tumorigenesis because it gained a growth benifit over normal cells that is easily selected for (survival of the fittest/natural selection). Furthermore, the increased growth also results in higher change of additional mutations that can increase the tumors malignancy.<br /><br />In normal cells, DNA methylation at repeats and intergenic regions protects the genome from genomic instability. In cancer these regions (especially repeats, rarer in other regions) are prone to hypomethylation (less methylation than you would see in normal cells). When repeats are unmethylated they can result in: <br />1) illegitamite genomic recombinations. This because methylation (and therefore chromosome packaging) usually prevents the pairing of genomically simillar regions that is nessesary for this procces to occur. <br />2) activation of repeats. As a concequence, these elements start copying themselfs, after which the copy is inserted somewhere else in the genome. If this happens within a gene, the gene coding is disrupted and can no longer exert its normal function. If this happens near a gene, a strong promotor is introduced that can alter gene expression of neighboring genes.<br /><br />The exact effects of aberant methylation can not be generalized since its dependent on: <br />- Tumor type &amp; stage<br />- Locations of aberant methylation in the genome<br />- Dependancy of the tumor on the methylation<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi). Decitabine itself is a nucleoside analog that gets incorpurated into the DNA during replication. When DNMT is copying methylation marks to the next generation, at some point, it will bind to Decitabine. When normally DNMTs binding to a methylated side is reversable, binding to decitabine is irriversible. This means that after binding the DNMT is stuck there and can no longer exert its function on other methylated sides. Therefore, the amount of active DNMT will decrease, as will the amount of methylation marks that are inherited by the daugther cells. In this way, the hypermethylation at CpG islands will be reversed, thereby exerting an anti-tumoral effect. Since the effect is dependant on cell division, tumor cells are effected more severly than normal cells because they replicate more often.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation through a drug can have enduring effects on the genome because methylation marks are mitotically heritable. This means that a cell with altered DNA methylation, will keep passing this pattern to the next generation of cells. <br /><br />A sensitive period is moment where a change in environment can have a significant effect on the epigenetic landscape. More precisely, it's when epigenetic reprogramming is taking place. There are two sensitive periods: <br />1) Early development, the period between fertilization and the blastocyst stage<br />2) Germ cell development, when primordial germ cells develop into gametes (eggs or sperm) <br /><br />If the patient is treated when he/she is still developing germ cells, the treatment may cause infertility or aberent epigenetic marks (and therefore altered gene expression that may cause disease) in his/her childeren. If a female is treated during early pregnancy, this can lead to a miscarrage or aberent epigenetic control in her child. However, when a pregnant female is treated later in the pregnancy, not only her child but also her grandchildren may suffer from the side effects of the treatment. This because the primordial germ cells of her child are also exposed. <br />  </div>
