    <div class="field-value">            In a normal cell, DNA methylation usually does NOT occur at CpG islands. Instead, this epigenetic mark may be found on the CpG dinucleotides in repetitive elements, intergenic regions and even in introns. DNA methylation leads to silencing of that region of the genome either directly (by making the region incapable of binding to transcription factors) or indirectly (by recruiting factors to prevent the transcription process). Therefore, in a normal cell CpG islands (which are are found at the promoters of genes) are NOT silenced thereby allowing for the downstream genes to be expressed. On the other hand, regions that contain methylation are silenced for good reason; the canonical example being that of repetitive elements - unstable portions of the DNA that can copy, insert and disrupt the entire genome.<br />            As this normal cell encounters several insults to its genome and epigenome, it has the potential for becoming cancerous. Two major epigenomic insults with regards to DNA methylation are the hypermethyation of CpG islands and the loss of methylation from intergenic regions and repetitive elements. The hypermethylation of CpG islands silences the downstream gene(s) some of which may be tumor suppressors. Without access to these genes the cancer cell may be able to survive better than its neighbors thereby giving it a selective advantage and the ability to form into a tumor and possibly even metastasize in the future. On the other hand, hypomethylation of repetitive elements "releases the beast" so to speak. The repetitive elements that were previously contained via the silencing marks are now capable of causing widespread genomic instability by not only inserting and disrupting tumor suppressors but also by inserting themselves near oncogenes and enhancing their expression (as a result of the extremely strong promoters that are associated with them). <i></i></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">            Imprinted genes tend to be involved in affecting growth and therefore their disruption can have a large contribution towards making a cell cancerous. One of the best examples of this is the H19/Igf2 cluster where, under normal circumstances, the imprint control region (ICR) of the paternal allele is methylated while the maternal one isn't. When unmethylated, the ICR binds to CTCF - an insulator protein which prevents the nearby gene (Igf2) from being transcribed by BLOCKING the action of enhancer elements located downstream. Instead, the normal product of this cluster is the H19 long non-coding RNA. However, the paternal allele has methylation which prevents binding of CTCF thereby allowing the   enhancers to act on Igf2 and transcribe it. Overall, in the normal scenario, the maternal allele produces H19 while the paternal allele produces Igf2 - a growth factor.<br />           Disruption of the imprinting of H19/Igf2 cluster is found in many types of cancers including Wilm's tumor (a type of kidney cancer) if it occurs in the fetus. This occurs once the maternal allele is hypermethylated which causes it to behave like the paternal allele. This double dose of Igf2 now acts like an oncogene and causes the affected cells to display accelerated growth.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">            Decitabine is an epigenetic inhibitor belonging to the family of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. It is an analog of the four normal nucleosides so it can get incorporated into DNA. Once there, it binds tightly and irreversibly to DNA methyltransferases preventing their action. Thereby, it prevents DNA methylation from being passed on to the daughter cell once a cell undergoes mitosis. Since this drug is replication dependent, it achieves maximum effect on rapidly dividing cells such as cancer cells and therefore has an anti-tumor effect. For example, if a certain tumor exhibits hypermethylation of several CpG islands, Decitabine treatment may be able to remove these epigenetic insults in daughter cells by inhibiting DNMT1. The resulting cells may not be as viable as the original cancer cell and may therefore fail to survive.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">            DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) ensures that DNA methylation is a mitotically heritable epigenetic mark. Through its actions, the effects of altering the methylation pattern in one cell can be passed down to all its progeny. This is one explanation for how Dr. Baylin's epigenetic drugs made a lasting impression on the tumor cells and made them susceptible to future treatments.<br />            Drugs that can have systemic, long-lasting effects on the epigenome of an individual should be administered cautiously since cells other than the cancer cells would also be affected. The age of the patient is a crucial factor when considering the use of such drugs because there are extremely sensitive periods of development that occur in younger patients. Sensitive periods of development occur when the genome is undergoing vast epigenetic reprogramming (i.e. primordial germ cell development) or even epigenetic remodeling (i.e. in differentiating cells). For example, inhibiting DNA methylation in a child can potentially stunt growth by disrupting imprinted genes (many of which are growth factors). Not only can administering these drugs have adverse affects on the patient but it is possible to pass adverse effects onto his/her progeny if the drug happens to prevent germ-line cells from remodeling the epigenome.</div>
