    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is the process by which a methyl group is added to the cytosine base in DNA sequence. DNA methylation of CpG islands in promoter regions will enhance or suppress gene expression in general. Under normal conditions, CpG islands located in the regulatory regions of many genes are not methylated. The optimum balance between methylated and non methylated areas ensures proper functioning of the cell and that important processes such as genomic imprinting, X inactivation, formation of heterochromatin and genome stability occur properly. 
In cancer, this methylation pattern is modified in comparison to a normal cell. 

CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated thereby blocking gene expression, most of them of tumor suppressor type. The alterations in methylation also involve other regulatory DNA areas which favor the loss of imprinting.

The inhibition of tumors suppressor genes together with other factors such as CpG hypomethylation of oncogenes promoter regions, contribute to carcinogenesis. Since the methylation process is mitotically heritable, this can lead to a proliferative advantage of cancer cells above others, and these alterations in methylation can be quickly selected.  

Other sites throughout the genome like intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated, maintaining genome stability. 

In cancer intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be hypomethylated. 

Disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements resulting in chromosomal instability by loss of protection against transposons, illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes . All these alterations in combinations with modification of DNA methylation at CpG islands, establish an aberrant methylation pattern which progresses in time and promotes the neoplastic transformation.

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Genomic imprinting is the process resulting from the monoallelic expression of specific parental origin of a particular gene. DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that ensures proper imprinting process. If we using the H19 / Igf2 cluster as reference, we can see that normally in the paternal allele the imprinting control region is methylated.  The insulating element (CTCF) union does not occur and together with methylation at the H19 promoter, the enhancers may act freely on Igf2 favoring expression thereof.

The maternal allele is unmethylated in the imprinting control region, allowing binding an insulating element (CTCF) that block the expression of Igf2, because the enhancers are located on the H19 side of the insulator, they cannot act on Igf2 but they will on H19. 

Wilm´s tumor is characterized by a loss of imprinting, so the maternal allele now is hypermethylated in the imprinting control region. It results in Igf2 expression in the maternal allele and H19 suppression.

Igf2 is a gene that promotes growth and H19 is a growth restricting gene. As both maternal and paternal alleles express Igf2, the resulting amount of Igf2 is double that of a normal cell, favoring malignant transformation.

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a hypomethylating drug. It has an inhibitory effect on DNA methyl transferase . 

The methylation process that is carried out under normal conditions for this enzyme, is inhibited in the DNA strands daughters in irreversible form when the cell is under this drug effect. By this reason decitabine reduced normal methylation in the complementary strands and the cell viability is limited.

The action of this inhibitor is therefore a dependent  process of cell division. This would facilitate an advantage, because like cancer cells replicate with greater ease and speed than normal cells, the drug would have greater effect than normal in malignant cells. It has also been said about the possible action of the drug at the level of hypermethylated CpG islands in cancer, to reduce methylation in these sites and favor the expression of tumor suppressor genes.

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The epigenome modifications derived from treatment with drugs that modified DNA methylation may have consequences beyond the exposure time. Many of these changes are mitotically heritable and these modifications can be transmitted by the mother cell to daughter cells to be erased progressively with division.  For this reasons is probably that if the standard chemotherapy  is used in combinations or after of hypomethylating agents,  may have better effect. 

Sensitive period is the stage of development in which environmental influences can alter the epigenetic machinery.

The prenatal period (especially the preimplantation stage and development of primordial cell), early postnatal period, childhood and puberty are vulnerable stages to damage the epigenome from external causes. For this reasons are named sensitive periods of development.

Some development stages , cells need to be reprogramming epigenetically, depending on the functionality and purpose of cell in the future.  If this cell is subjected to the effects of an agent that disrupts DNA methylation, the required epigenetic mark at each stage are not set properly and must be taken into account to avoid administering these drugs in a sensitive period where environmental influences can alter the epigenetic machinery.
