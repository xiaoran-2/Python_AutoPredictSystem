    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell  CpG islands are usually unmethylated, and the intergeneric regions -usually methylated, repetitive elements are usually methylated.If methylation occurs at CpG islands lead to gene silencing. In a cancer cell, as a rule of thumb you observe reversal in this pattern: CpG islands are more likely to be hypermethylated, and the latter regions are hypomethylated. For the CpG islands, this leads to problems as tumor suppressor genes may become silenced, allowing the cell to divide more rapidly, outcompete its neighboring cells, and grow into tumor. For the latter regions, normally hypermethylation at these sites is associated with greater genomic stability, so hypomethylation during cancer leads to copying errors such abrations, deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations in the chromosomes</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is a particularly attractive form of regulation to target in treatments because it can be manipulated once, and enduring effects are ensured as the DNA methyltransferase enzymes preserve methyl marks during mitosis. However, these global interventions may interfere with ordinary functioning of the system, especially during critical periods of time where extensive epigenetic reprograming occurs. In particular, it would be inadvisable to prescribe these treatments to pregnant mothers(including a few months before conception)as a lot of reprogramming happens in ealry child development as well as during the formation of gametes (in male and female) and the sensitive periods of development from Birth(0) to Six (6)yrs. Defination of sensitive period:several overlapping periods of development where a child is sensitive to a particular stimuli or type of interaction. sensitive periods are :-age 0-6 yrs: language, age 1-3 yrs: order, age 0-4 yrs: sensory skills, age 1.5 -4 yrs: motor skills, age 2.5-6 yrs: social skills.during sensitive period  epigenetic drug treatment inadvisable reason is severe epigenetic abnormalities will occur like.. severe  impairment in language, sensory &amp; motor skills and social skills development etc.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) (Demthylation agent) belongs to a class of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors, and thus contributes to hypomethylation of DNA. This turns out to be particularly useful in treating myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (conditions under which the bone marrow produces deformed blood cells), which is a precursor of acute myelogenous leukemia and CML (Chronic Myeloid Leukemia). In case of Decitabine, works by demethylation or interfering with the methylation of DNA. By this process of demethylation, normal function to the tumor suppressor genes are restored, thus restoring control over cell growth. So the anti-tumor effect has been linked to reactivation of epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor genes, induced by the hypomethylation.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a cell around the H19/Igf2 locus we ordinarly see the DNA methylation of the paternal allele at the ICR, and no methylation for maternal allele. The CTCF complex binds to the allele on the maternal strand and the downstream enhancers act on H19 as a result. the CTCF complex does not bind to the paternal allele due to the methyl marks, which leads to silencing of the H19 gene as the enhancers instead drive expression of Igf2. Thus, in a normal cell you can observe a normal dose of both H19 from maternal strand and Igf2 from paternal strand. how ever when this ICR becomes hypermethylated, both strands appear to be of paternal origin and get expressed as such. That is the system gets a double dose of (growth-promoting) Igf2 (as well as no dose of H19). This is associated with Wilm's tumour</div>
