    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>

<p>A
pattern of DNA methylation will persist through somatic cell
replication throughout the life of an individual.  Such patterns will
be erased during embryonic development and during the development of
primordial germ cells for the reproduction of the individual.  These
are called sensitive periods during which the cell development
process is extremely sensitive to environmental disturbance, which
could adversely effect the development of the individual or his/her
offspring.

    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>

        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.

<p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating
agent.  It acts by decreasing the methylation of parts of the DNA
molecules (human chromosomes).  It is most effective in treating
cancer by decreasing hypermethylation at CpG islands, which is a
concomitant of some cancers.  Such treatment must be careful to
minimize demethylation of other areas of the genome where decreased
methylation has the opposite effect (such as intergenic and repeat
segments).

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; }


<p>On the paternal allele hypermethylation occurs on H19 and ICR so
the activators can reach Igf2, the expression of which is, thereby,
enhanced.  On the maternal allele there is little methylation on H19
or ICR, so CTCF binds on the ICR and the activators cannot reach
Igf2, which, therefore, remains unexpressed.  In the case of  Wilm’s
tumor hypermethylation occurs on the maternal ICR (as well as on the
paternal allele).  This prevents CTCF from binding and leaves the
activators to promote the expression of Igf2 just as on the paternal
allele.  There is now a double dose of Igf2, which is a strongly
growth producing agent .  This double dose (of both maternal and
paternal origin), can enhance Wilm's tumor growth, as well as other
forms of cancer. In fact the hypermethylation of the ICR may be a
precursor for many other forms of cancer.

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

<p>In normal cells the CpG islands are not
highly methylated.  In many cancerous cells the CpG islands become
hypermethylated; this hypermethylation may suppress many genes that
play a role in the suppression of uncontrolled growth.  The
intergenic regions and repetitive elements of normal chromosomes are
strongly methylated.  Such methylation is strongly decreased in
cancerous cells.  Growth promoting genes, which would normally be
suppressed by normal methylation of these regions, will now be
released to enhance the spread of cancer.
