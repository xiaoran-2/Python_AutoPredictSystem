    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value">alteration of DNA methylation could cause cancer or affect development of it . CpG islands usually found on promoter of many of gene and normally this  CpG islands are non methelated in tumor suppressor gene which activated it in contrast , oncogene has methylated  CpG islands which deactivated it in normal cell, altered methelation state of CpG islands cause cancer e.g : methylation of CpG islands of suppressor gene lead to inactivated it and loss of methylation in CpG islands of oncogene lead to activate it. indeed methylation of CpG islands increase with progress of cancer and related to invasion of cancer <br /><br />- DNA methylation in wide genome also change in cancer, DNA have many  intergenic regions and repetitive elements which usually inactivated by DNA methylation, in cancer cell there is hypomethylation in wide genome which lead to demethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements this elements  contain transposon and demethylation active it  and lead to genome instability  and Can result in activation of genes that cause cancer (oncogene )<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>in imprinting  gene there in one active allele which on "origin of parental"  for example H19/Igf2 cluster has Igf2  allele which is active in father allele but not in mother the reason of this is because of  methylation state of ICR  "inter control region " when this region  methylated, Igf2 will not expressed like in  mother allele in contrast demethylation of  ICR will result of expression of Igf2  as in father allele so in normal cell there is  Igf2  father allele " active " and  mother allele " inactive " . in Wilm’s tumour ther is overexpression of  Igf2 which is lead to increase of proliferation and cause cancer,and this is because of Hypermethylation of ICR because Hypermethylation of ICR, lead to active both allele and overexpression of  Igf2</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Decitabine  is cancer drug which is belong to DNMTi which inhibitor DNA metthyltransferase. inhibition of metthyltransferase lead to decrease dna methylation,  Decitabine   used for hematological malignance which depend on tumor suppressor gene hypermethylation so use  Decitabine will decrease methylation and reactive  tumor suppressor gene</div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>altering DNA methylation could alter nuclear architecture  and alter gene expression of many of gene and alter chromaten structure it look like reprogramming of cell and it division related. a sensitive period is a period which epigenome set, which is germ cells production or Embryo development and particularly in early development  in Blastocyst. treating patients during sensitive periods will alter whole epigenome  which will have severe side effect .<br /></div></div>
