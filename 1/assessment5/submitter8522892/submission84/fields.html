    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is the process to add a methyl group in the cytosine base (C5). In a normal cell, the case of CpG islands, generally, they are unmethylated. The methylation is done by a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) enzymes, when the DNA replicates, this make that daughter strands have unmethylated cytosine, then in this case, it is the DNMT1 will add the methyl group into the C5.  Also, they are the DNMT3A and DNMT3B that aggregates the methyl group performing "de novo" methylation in early develpment. DNA methylation has the characteristic that not allow the transcription of the genes. In cancer, the DNA methylation has gone to the extreme: the hypermethylation in CpG islands and the genome-wide hypomethylation. The hypermethylation in CpG is presented in cancer cell, this action is done specially in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes, and epigenetically speaking this will silence the promoters and be inherited to the next generation of daughter cells causing that the cells don't decrease cell growth. The methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements in a normal cell are methylated in order to have integrity along the DNA eg. avoiding translocation or insertions; meanwhile, these regions are complete different in cancer cells which are hypomethylated. This will lead that the genome stability breaks and all possible of action might occur such as deletions of part of chromosome, recombinations between different chromosomes disrupting genes or activating neighbouring genes that normally would be silenced.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation provokes the silence of genes however this doesn't work in imprinted regions. For example, the H19/Igf2 cluster which Igf2 gene is expressed only from the paternal allele meanwhile H19 is only transcribed from the maternal allele.  There is a region between the Igf2 and H19 called ICR and also there are enhancers upstream H19 gene.  In the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated for that reason CTCF can bind the region and this binding blocks the enhancers then there is no expression of Igf2 however the enhancers only influence the transcription of the H19. In the paternal site, ICR are methylated then CTCF can't bind the region and the enhancer promote the expression of Igf2 but not H19.As the name states, Igf2 is a growth factor that when the methylation is disrupted leads to different states for example Wilm's tumour; in this case, when ICR of the maternal allele is methylated, the enhancers that once were blocked by the binding of CTCF, promotes the expression of Igf2, now there is an over-expression of this gene to increase the growth rate than normal cells which is one of the characteristic of cancer. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that target cancerous cells is too much difficult therefore, the researchers has been found a way to combat cancer by attacking the epigenetic machinery such as decitabine. This drug is a DNA methyltransferease inhibitor. This drug has a good performance in methylation reducing it.  The daughter strands will be unmethylated and the DNMT 1 comes to add the methyl group, it is here where decitabine works, this drug will bind the enzyme and does not let it go, stopping the methylation process.  Cancer cells has the characteristic that the cell divides without control, so this drug is useful as the drug will bind the DNMT1 stopping methylation and as the cell divides, they will lose the methylation.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs with action in the epigenome have a wider action than the normal therapies for the influence in the disease. This means they influence the environment in which the cancerous cells are growing. Just for the previous example, wilm's tumour. The action of the epigenetic drugs in the methylation of the maternal allele could alter and/or stop the uncontrollable growth rate, this would lead the chemotherapy had effects now in the group of cancerous cells with no division properties. Also, the use of epigenetic drugs should be aware of the period to be used as exists sensitive period. The sensitive period is the time of epigenetic reprogramming when the DNA methylation starts to decrease in this in order to obtain totipotency. These sensitive periods are early embryonic development and germ cell development. Treatment in these periods could be affected the DNA disrupting the stages if epigenetic reprogramming.</div>
