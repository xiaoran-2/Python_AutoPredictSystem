    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is an enzymatic process, in which a methyl moiety is covalently attached to the C5 position of a cytosine base in the CpG dinucleotide sequence. CpG islands (CGIs) are high dense clusters of CpG dinucleotides in human genome. Disruptions of DNA methylation patterns in CGIs, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are commonly found in various types of cancers. There are about 60% of human promoters containing CGIs, and DNA methylation at the promoter regions inversely correlates with gene expression. Methylation, targeted at CGIs, is an important part of the mechanisms that govern X-chromosome inactivation; it is also essential for the maintenance of imprinted genes and, at least in some cases, is critical in determining the cell-type-specific expression patterns of genes. In normal cells, promoter CGIs are usually unmethylated, however, in cancer cells the islands tend to be hypermethylated. Inactivation of tumour suppressor genes by CGIs hypermethylation contributes to a frequent cause of cancer. DNA methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements plays a role in maintaining genomic stability in normal cells. Hypomethylation of repeats and intergenic intervals are usually found in cancer. This DNA hypomethylation in general leads to genomic instability, as results of illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters, and disruption to neighbouring genes. These disruptive events can lead to abnormal karyotype, such as chromosomal deletions, reciprocal translocations, and insertion.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cells, <em>Igf2</em> (paternally expressed and maternally imprinted) and <em>H19</em> (paternally imprinted and maternally expressed) are separated by the genomic imprinting control region (ICR) recognized by the transcriptional regulator CTCF. Paternal allelic hypermethylation at the ICR and the <em>H19</em> gene leads to silencing of <em>H19</em> while activation of the <em>Igf2</em> gene. Maternal alleles are hypomethylated, which result in expression of <em>H19</em> while silencing of <em>Igf2</em>. The maternal <em>Igf2</em> silencing is due to enhancer-mediated insulation (the enhancers are located downstream of the <em>H19</em> gene) of <em>Igf2</em> by binding of CTCF to the unmethylated ICR. In the condition of Wilm’s tumour, these imprinting controls are lost, in which the ICR and <em>H19</em> of both paternal and maternal alleles are hypermethylated, resulting in silencing both <em>H19</em> alleles while activating both <em>Igf2</em> alleles. The major role of IGF2 is as a growth-promoting hormone during gestation, while H19 has a role in the negative regulation (or limiting) of body weight and cell proliferation. Thus, the upregulation of growth-promoting <em>Igf2</em> gene and downregulation of growth-restricting <em>H19</em> gene contribute to Wilm’s tumour. In fact, many imprinted genes are involved in cell growth, and loss of imprinting is a common feature of cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Tumour suppressor genes can become aberrantly methylated and therefore silenced in tumour cells. Decitabine is a class of drug called a DNA demethylating or hypomethylating agent, which can be used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. It works by inhibiting an epigenetic regulator protein called DNA methyltransferase. This results in decreasing DNA methylation, because the DNA methyltransferase is no longer active in the presence of decitabine, and therefore methylation marks are diluted after each round of semiconservative DNA replication (Inactivation of DNA methyltransferase causes hypomethylation because of a failure to methylate newly synthesized DNA). Upon removal of repressive methylation marks, tumour supressor genes are reactivated, and then help to stop the cancer cells growing and dividing.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In mammalian systems, <em>de novo</em> DNA methylation is carried out by enzymes called Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b, which give symmetrical methylation at certain CpG pairs. During the sermiconservative DNA replication process, another enzyme called Dnmt1 completes half-methylated sites, but does not methylate unmodified CpGs. Therefore, DNA methylation marks are maintained by the action of Dnmt1, which give rise to enduring effects on the epigenome. A sensitive period in epigenetics is defined as a period of time that the epigenome is undergoing establishment of epigenetic marks, in which is sensitive to environmental factors. Environmental tabulation can influence DNA methylation patterns in the sensitive periods. There are two sensitive periods: gametogenesis and early preimplantation development, in which the epigenetic reprogramming occurs. Treating patients with epigenetic drugs during the sensitive periods would be inadvisable, because environment-induced DNA methylation patterns represent stable epigenetic modifications that alter gene transcription throughout the lifespan of patients, due to mitotically heritable nature of methylation marks.<br /></div>
