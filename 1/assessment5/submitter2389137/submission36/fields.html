    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">If CpG islands are methylated then the gene is usually repressed. In Cancer, there is genome wide DNA hypomethylation leading to increase in expression of oncogenes.So they are more expressed leading to cancers. Also there is DNA methylation in the tumor suppressor genes leading to repression of these protective genes further accentuating the condition. Function of DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements are to maintain genome integrity. At repetitive elements, DNA methylation acts by silencing the repeats thereby preventing transposition and avoiding transcription from strong promoters. When these are disrupted in cancer, there is genome instability. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">H19 is a long non coding RNA and it contains ICR (Imprinting control region) which is differentially methylated according to parental inheritance. The paternal allele is usually methylated whereas, the maternal allele is hypo/unmethylated and there by expressing H19. In case of Igf2, usually the paternal one is expressed and the maternal imprinted.<br /><span>In case of Wilms' tumor cells have shown loss of imprinting of the maternal chromosome. H19 is decreased but Igf2 is overexpressed. Since there is less/no H19 which reduces cell growth and incresed Igf2 which stimulates cell growth, there is tumor formation.</span><span> </span><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA hypomethylating agent. Decitabine acts by inhibiting DNA methyl transferase (DNMT) which is necessary for methylating the target sites. Since the DNA methylation is not passed on to the dividing cells there is loss of methylation of tumor suppressor genes and thereby increasing their expression. Decitabine is used in hematological malignancies especially myelodysplastic syndromes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation could have enduring effects on the epigenome via transgenerational inheritance through the gametes. A sensitive period is one when the effects of experience are very strong. Sensitive periods with regard to epigenetics could be prenatal(gamete formation), perinatal ( zygote, embryo stage, midgestation and during blood cell development). Since there could be Inheritance of phenotypes or gene expression
patterns from parent to offspring by passage
through the germ cells, treating the patients during sensitive periods is not advisable.</div>
