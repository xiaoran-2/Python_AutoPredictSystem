    <h1>Submission 556 from Anon (session_user_id: 264668efe4dac1bf3c06658db6bc1c756c152729)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent,
also known as DNA Methlytransfer Inhibiters (DNMTi), and is used in the
treatment of  MyeloDysplastic Syndromes. Decitabine,
along with other DNMTi's, are incorporated into the DNA when a cell replicates;
once part of the genome, these "nucleoside analogues" bind DNA
Methyltransferases when the DNMT tries to copy the methylation to the daughter
strand at replication. As more DNMTs are bound to the drug the overall level of
DNA methylation in that cell will fall, because the cell is unable to maintain
the aberrant methylation when the cell replicates. This will affect cancer
cells more than normal cells because cancer cells replicate very rapidly.
Ultimately this will have an anti-tumour affect as the hypermethylation, and
therefore silencing, of tumour-suppressor genes is reduced, allowing the cell
to take back control of its cell cycle</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA Methylation in Cancer cells is characterized by two features: genome-wide hypomethylation;
and focused areas of hypermethylation at CpG islands and surrounding
"shores".</p>

<p>In normal cells there is limited methylation at CpG
islands, particularly in promoters with a high CpG density, because methylation
of promoters is correlated with gene-silencing. Cancer forms when hypermethylation
of CpG islands occurs in the promoter of tumour-suppressor genes, silencing the gene; the cell
loses its ability to control its replication, cell death and DNA
repair. Multiple "hits" to the DNA (to both copies of a gene or other
tumour-suppressors) can cause the cell to replicate rapidly, and form a tumour
instead of dying, even with the presence of DNA mistakes. As
the cancer progresses, the levels of methylation in each new daughter cell
increases and the tumour becomes out of control, eventually metastisizing into
surrounding tissues.</p><p>Genome-wide DNA Methylation issues are
due to hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements. A key function
of DNA Methylation in normal cells is to maintain genomic stability by ensuring
the cell doesn't lose or gain chromosomes and to avoid translocations of parts
of chromosomes. </p><p>

</p><p>These aberrations can be caused by long repeats forming
recombinations. Also Transposons
can disrupt the normal functioning of a gene or they can activate neighbouring
genes by inserting themselves with a strong promoter upstream, so it is
important for these to be suppressed through DNA methylation. In
cancer the repetitive regions are not methylated so they can align with
repeats in other chromosomes, forming recombinations, and cause
translocations. If certain intergenic regions are not methylated
they can transpose themselves into other sections of the DNA and disrupt normal
gene function. Hypomethylation also occurs at promotors that are CpG-poor and
so activate oncogenes that are usually silent in somatic cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Loss of imprinting through disruption in the methylation of
the Imprint Control Regions  (ICRs) can
lead to altered gene-expression and therefore either activation of oncogenes,
as in the case of H19/Igf2 cluster, or silencing of tumour-suppressor genes. In
a normal cell the H19/Igf2 ICR is imprinted on the paternal allele but not on
the maternal allele. This means that the unmethylated ICR on the maternal
allele will bind CTCF so the downstream enhancers are blocked from accessing
Igf2 and instead will act on H19. In the paternal, methylated allele CTCF
cannot bind to the ICR (due to the methylation) so the enhancers are free to
activate Igf2 instead of H19. If there is hypermethylation of the maternal ICR
at this locus, CTCF is unable to bind to either strand so no H19 will be
expressed but there will be overexpression of Igf2. Igf2 is a growth-promoting
oncogene and overexpression is associated with Wilm's tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable so it is important
to consider the long-term consequence of any drugs that alter DNA methylation
throughout the system. Drugs that inhibit DNA Methyltransferases will reduce
the levels of DNA methylation in the daughter cells at each replication,
because the cell cannot adequately methylate the daughter DNA strands. Over
time this will lead to epigenetic marks being lost. This is the desired
response in the cells being targeted by the drug but cells across the whole
organism will also be affected to a lesser degree.. In cases such as cancer,
where survival is the main priority, the long-term effects are not always
considered to be as important but these effects should be considered in younger
patients, particularly those who wish to have children. There are two periods
of cell development during which an organism is particular sensitive to
epigenetic changes: during the reprogramming that occurs firstly during early embryonic
development and secondly during germ cell development. It is during these
periods that most existing epigenetic marks are cleared and new epigenetic
marks are established to differentiate cell types. Any disruption during during
germ cell development could have implications for the patient's future
children.</p></div>
