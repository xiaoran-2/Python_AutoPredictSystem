    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normally,CpG islands are mostly unmethylated If methylated it cause gene silencing .for example,the inactive X chromosome shows methylation at CpG island.this action is supposed by 2 mechanisms: the first and most important mechanism is by repressing the chromatin structure as methylated CpG binds to methylated CpG binding protiens which condense the chromatin or act as atranscriptional repression domain,the socend mechanism by prohibit transcriptional factors binding.<br />In cancer, CpG islands are hypermethylated which cause silencing of tumor suppressor genes thus tumor is easly to occur and it is obviously seen when multiple hits or DNA are affected(knudson hypothsis)<br /><span> Normally,intergenic region and repetitive element are methylated: In intergenic region it silence the cryptic promotor(promotor has the reverse way of the traditional promotor and at its same course) which prevent transcriptional interfase.In repititive element methylation silence the repeats which prevent transposition and transcriptional interfase from strong promotors and it also mutate the repeats(metC to T)which prevent transposition and illigimate recompination.<br /></span>In cancer,intergenic regions and repeatitive elements are hypomethylated which cause genomic instability:there are illigimate recombination deletion insertion and reciproical tarnsposition ,activation of repeits and transposition,activation of cryptic promotors and disruption of neibouring genes.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the paternal allele,the imprented controle region (ICR) is methylated which pave the way to the inhancers to act on Igf2 which allow its expression.<br />In the maternal allele,the ICR is unmethylated which allow its cap by CTCF which prevent the inhancers to act on Igf2 which prevent its expression but rather act on H19 and cause its expression.<br />In willms tumor,the maternal allele behave like the paternal allele caused by hypermethylation of the ICR thus,over expression of Igf2 and lack of expression of H19.<br />In cancer,there is over expression of Igf2 (growth promoting gene) and less expression of H19 (growth inhibiting gene) by hypermethylation  of ICR. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is EZH2 inhibitor.<br /> Decitabine cause DNA demethylation as it inhibit EZH2 which lay down a methyle group to histone protiens.<br />EZH2 causes chromosome packaging. in cancer,over activity of EZH2 causes further chromosome packaging which silence genes thus ,tumor supressor gene silenced causes cell growth and cancer.<span> Decitabine inhibit EZH2.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">epigenatic machinary are sensitive to methylated or demethylated DNA and any alteration in DNA methylation  cause alteration in epigenome and there are many examples such as CTCF cap at ICR of <span>H19/Igf2 cluster.</span><br />sensitive periods are the perios of which reprogramming occur.<br />sensitive periods of development areperiods of early emprionic development and premordial germ cell development.<br /> treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable as it is liable easly to change in the epigenome.<br /></div>
