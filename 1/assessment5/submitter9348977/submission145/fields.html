    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer we find DNA methylation is
altered. In normal cells CpG islands are usually hypomethylated. In cancer
cells however we find the opposite to be true with CpG islands more likely to
be hypermethylated. </p>

<p>This disruption of DNA methylation at CpG
islands contributes to cancer because generally CpG islands are found in
promoters of tumour suppressor genes and hypermethylation results in silencing
of the suppressor gene. Due to this and other contributing factors the cancer
cells now have an advantage over other cells and divide more rapidly taking
over instead of dying and cause a tumour.</p>

<p>Most of the genome however, is not made up of
CpG islands but of intergenic regions, repetitive elements and areas which in
normal cells are hypermethylated. This maintains genomic stability.</p>

<p><span>In cancer cells however, these areas are
hypomethylated. This can result in illegitimate recombination between repeats,
activation of repeats and transposition, as well as activation of cryptic
promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes. This genome wide
hypomethylation leads to genomic instability which contributes to cancer.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting can contribute to
cancer. A good example of how this happens can be seen when hypermethylation
occurs at the H19/Igf2 cluster.</p>

<p>In a normal cell the paternal allele is hypermethylated
at the Imprint Control Region (ICR), blocking binding of CTCF an insulator
protein which insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. This silences H19 and
allows enhancers to act on Igf2 leading to its expression.</p>

<p>With the maternal allele however, the ICR is
insulated by CTCF and is not methylated. This allows enhancers to act on H19
allowing expression. Igf2 therefore remains silent.</p>

<p>In the case of Wilm’s tumour we see loss of
imprinting due to hypermethylation of the ICR on the maternal allele. CTCF
binding does not take place. H19 is silenced so enhancers now act on Igf2
leading to its expression. There is now effectively a double dose of Igf2
acting as a growth promoting oncogene which contributes to Wilm’s tumour.</p>

<p><span>Cancer simply put is activation of oncogenes
and inactivation of tumour suppressors. This disruption of imprinting at the
H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer because Igf2 acting as a growth
promoting oncogene is over expressed and H19 which acts as a tumour suppressor
gene is inactivated.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer we see mutations in all types of
epigenetic regulators. Several drugs have been designed that affect these
epigenetic processes a few of which are FDA approved for use in certain types
of cancer. One such FDA approved drug is Decitabine. It is a DNA
methyltransferase inhibitor and is approved for use in myelodysplastic syndrome
which has progressed to acute myeloid leukaemia.</p>

<p>DNA methylation is laid down by
methyltransferases so Decitabine being a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor acts
as a hypomethylating agent. It is incorporated into the DNA upon replication
where it binds to DNA methyltransferases which results in demethylation when
cells divide.</p>

<p><span>This disruption of DNA methylation, from
hypermethylation to hypomethylation, now allows expression of previously
silenced suppressor genes which can then control cell growth. This and the fact
that cancer cells divide more rapidly than normal cells so are more severely
affected has an anti-tumour effect</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic marks which direct DNA methylation
are mitotically heritable. This means drugs which alter DNA methylation will
have effects which last longer than just the period of treatment. The drugs
alter the epigenome and these changes will be passed on during cell division
and need to be actively erased.</p>

<p><span>With this in mind there are sensitive periods
during which it would not be wise to use these types of drugs on patients.
Periods of epigenetic reprogramming are sensitive periods. For example, during
germ cell development and early embryonic development. </span></p><p><span>It is important to
remember that drugs that alter DNA methylation work throughout the body with
every cell potentially being affected in a lasting way. Therefore, their use
should be avoided on young patients or during sensitive periods.</span></p></div>
