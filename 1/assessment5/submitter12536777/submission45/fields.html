    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation forms an important part of the normal cell-regulatory processes that govern gene transcription.   Altered methylation patterns are occur in the DNA of cancer cells. There are two altered patterns : wide areas of global hypomethylation along the genome (it allows the expression of previously quiescent protooncogenes to become active and induce the cell proliferation events ), and localized areas of hypermethylation at certain specific sites, the CpG islands, within the gene promoter regions (silencing through inhibition of transcription) CpG island methylation plays a critical role in the inactivation of tumour suppressor genes during the development of cancer.. CpG islands are protected from methylation in normal cells, Abnormal patterns of DNA  methylation (CpG island hypermethylation)  are observed in cancers: the vast majority of methylated CpG's do in fact reside within repetitive elements. Hypermethylation of CpG islands  in the promoter regions of several genes, including  tumor suppressor genes, results in the subsequent failure to express their functional proteins and enability to suppress cell proliferation. Hypermethylated promoters are almost always transcriptionally silent, packaged into a chromatin structure resistant to nucleases, and enriched in hypoacetylated core histones. One of the main roles of DNA methylation in  intergenic regions is to repress the expression of potentially harmful genetic elements
In normal cells methylation of repetitive sequences prevents genomic instability .Moreover, transposable elements cannot be activated in a methylated environment. In cancer cells, global hypomethylation occur in repetitive elements triggers genomic instability as result of   aberrant transcription initiations . Concomitant activation of transposons may lead to gene disruption. Several studies have demonstratedthat the degree of hypomethylation correlates with disease progression</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprinted genes are monoallelically expressed according to the parent of origin and are critical for proper placental and embryonic development. Disruption of methylation patterns at imprinted loci resulting in loss of imprinting (LOI) may lead to serious imprinting disorders.Hyper- and hypomethylation at the IGF2-H19 imprinting control region (ICR) result in reciprocal changes in IGF2-H19 expression and the two contrasting growth disorders, Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) and Silver–Russell syndrome (SRS). 
 On H19/Igf2 locus we can see the methylation only on the paternal allele at the ICR, it leads to silencing of the H19 (CTCF complex does not bind to the paternal allele due to the methylation). maternal allele, bounded by The CTCF complex and the downstream enhancers act on H19 , drive expression of Igf2 as a result.
  LOI in WT involves activation of the normally silent maternal allele of the insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF2) gene, silencing of the normally active maternal allele of the H19 gene, upstream of the maternal copy of H19. Recently, the transcription factor CTCF, which binds to the H19 DMR, has been implicated in the maintenance of H19 and IGF2 imprinting.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The   reactions during epigenetic processes are susceptible to chemical intervention (open to drug treatment) in a way that genetic mutations are not. 
Decitabine (DAC)  has DNA-demethylated effec and this drug used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia and  potential activity in solid tumors.    Cells in the presence of DAC incorporate it into DNA during replication and RNA during transcription. This incorporation of DAC into DNA or RNA inhibits methyltransferase thereby causing demethylation in that sequence. cell cycle analysis detect that  DAC mainly caused an increase of cells in G2/M.
DNA methyltransferase inhibitors and have shown substantial potency in reactivating epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor genes in vitro.
Anti-tumor effect: epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division. Due to this effect, the cancer cells  do not return
,if once erased. It will  stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is a particularly attractive form of regulation to target in treatments because it can be manipulated once, and enduring effects are ensured as the DNA methyltransferase enzymes preserve methyl marks during mitosis. However, these global interventions may interfere with ordinary functioning of the system, especially during critical periods periods of
time where extensive epigenetic reprogramming occurs. In particular, it would be inadvisable to prescribe these treatments to pregnant mothers (including a few months before conception) as a lot of reprogramming happens in early child development as well as during the formation of gametes</div>
