    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value">CpG islands can often be found in the promoter region and under normal state, are usually free of DNA methylation as the region is actively being transcribed. However, methylation patterns are disrupted in cancer where promoter CpG islands can become hypermethylated, thereby causing the silencing of the underlying gene. This disruption contributes to cancer as the silencing of tumour suppressor genes via hypermethylation ultimately allows the cancerous cell to continue to proliferate and spread much faster than a healthy cell.<br /><br />Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are generally methylated in healthy cells to maintain genomic stability. However, methylation patterns are disrupted in cancer and these regions can become hypomethylated. As a result, this disruption contributes to cancer by decreasing genomic stability and can be seen in the illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and their transposition, as well as activation cryptic promoters which can disrupt neighboring genes that would otherwise be inactive. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the healthy state, the imprinting control region (ICR) of the paternal allele is methylated. This allows the downstream enhancers to act on the <em>Igf2 </em>promoter so Igf2 is expressed from the paternal allele. In contrast, the ICR of the maternal allele is not methylated, allowing CTCF to bind the insulator element which thereby allows the downstream enhancers to act on the <em>H19 </em>promoter so H19 is expressed from the maternal allele. As a result, <em>Igf2 </em>is transcriptionally silent and is not expressed from the maternal allele.<em></em><br /><br />In Wilm's tumour, imprinting is disrupted and the ICR of the maternal allele is hypermethylated (the same methylation pattern as the paternal allele). This results in the expression of Igf2 from both the maternal and paternal alleles. The overexpression of the growth-promoting Igf2 contributes to cancer as the affected cell will undergo unregulated growth and proliferation.<em></em></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is an epigenetic inhibitor that acts as a DNA-demethylating agent or categorized as a DNMT inhibitor (DNMTi) and may be used to treat cancer by irreversibly inhibiting DNA methyltransferases. Specifically, Decitabine acts as a nucleoside analog and is incorporated into the DNA. When DNMT binds to Decitabine it is permanently bound and can no longer function to pass on the methylation mark to the daughter cells. Decitabine is division dependent - it prevents the mitotic heritability of methylation patterns and thus possesses an anti-tumour effect. Because tumours replicate much more rapidly than normal cells, they will be much more severely effected.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic alterations (such as DNA methylation patterns) are mitotically heritable and are passed on during cell division. Such alterations, as a result of a drug, can thus have lasting effects even after the drug treatment period has concluded.<br /><br />Epignetic drugs should avoid being used when treating patients undergoing sensitive periods of epigenetic regulation. Such periods are times of when epigenetic marks are still be cleared or set-down and there disruption may have a lasting impact on their germ cells. These periods include the preimplantation of an embryo and during the production of the primordial germ cells. By extension, the pre-pubescent age is still a sensitive period as germ cells are still undergoing maturation as epigenetic marks are still being laid down.<br /><br />Treating these patients (pregnant women and pre-pubescent children) is inadvisable as such epigenetic drugs may disrupt the epigenetic regulation of their germ cells.</div>
