    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Cancer cells show an increase in the methylation (hypermethylation) at CpG islands and a genome wide decrease in methylation (hypomethylation). Both type of changes in DNA methylation progresses with time.<br />Hypermethylation of CpG islands can cause the silencing of tumour suppressor genes, which will increase the tumor growth.<br />The hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repeats will cause genetic instability. The results of this instabliity are (more) mutations and possible activation of oncogenes. <br /><br />Details of the genetic instability:<br />The methylation of repetitive elements prevents the activation and transpositions of repeats. These activations and transpositions can cause the silencing or activition of other genes. Also recombination in 'not correct'  regions (e.g. between different chromosomes) is prevented, because the repeats are in heterochromatine and recombinations with a repeat on a different chromosome is prevented.<br />The methylation of intergenic regions prevent the activation of cryptic promotors. So demethylation can cause the activation of oncogenes or disrupt the expression of other genes.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The ICR (imprint control region) of the maternal allele is not methylated and the CTCF protein can bind to the ICR. The binding of this protein prevents the activation of the IGF2 gene by upstream enhancers. The  ICR of the paternal allele is methylated and the CTCF protein can not bind to the ICR. Upstream enhancers can activate the IFG2 gene. <br />In Wilm's tumour the ICR of the maternal allele is methylated so it has the same expression as the paternal allele. More IGF2 is produced and this protein is a growth promoter, which can cause tumours. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) and has effect on the DNA methylation. Decitabine irreversible bind DNMT, so the methylation of the DNA is reduced and DNA demethylation can occur. <br />Demethylation of CpG islands can activate tumour suppressor genes and 'fight' the tumor.<br />Decitabine is a nucleoside analog that has to be incorporated into the DNA to be effective. So cell division is necessary for activating the effect of decitabine. This is probably the reason that cancer cells (with high division rates) are impacted by the drug and no (or minor) effects on normal tissue.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation changes are mitotically heritable because the DNA methylation pattern is preserved during cell devision. The enzyme DNMT1 will methylate the other demethylated half of <span>hemimethylated DNA. So changes that are the result of epigenetic drugs can last beyond the period of drug treatment.<br />In the sensitive periods of the human development the epigenetics marks of the cells are changed and in these periods epigenetic drugs can have big (negative) effects. <br />The sensitive periods are during the early embryonic development  and during the primordial germ cell development. Changes in the epigenetic marks during these periods can have big effects on the developing embryo in treated pregnant woman or on the future children of the treated person.<br />So treating pregnant woman or children with epigenetic drugs would be inadvisable.</span></div>
