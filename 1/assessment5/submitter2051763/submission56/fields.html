    <div class="field-value">In exploring how cancer may be caused, it is important to realize that cancer IS ALWAYS A GENETIC DISEASE.  DNA methylation which is common in turning genes on or off is done when methyl groups or acetyl groups attach themselves to DNA chains and change the chemical reactions that are possible but do it differently than actually changing the DNA sequence. CpG islands occur generally at the transcription start site of genes.  It appears that silencing CGI promoters occurs after dense CpG methylation, which in turn helps regulate gene activity.  In cancer, however, this DNA methlyation is disrupted.  Said in another way methylation occurs at CpG islands in cancer but not at intergenic regions, repetitive elements nor CpG islands seen in normal cells.  The intrinsic nature of these reactions means that genetic processes are then susceptible to chemical intervention.  In Cancer's Epicenter written recently in The Economist (Apr 7th 2012) it was explained that these reactions are consequently susceptible to chemical intervention in a way that genetic mutations are not.  They are open to drug treatment.  Methylation can cause overactivity which silences tumor suppressor genes that stop the uncontrolled cell growth which causes Cancer.  Apparently,when treating lymphoma cells, for example, with an inhibitor, histone overmethlyation declined  as did tumor cells.  If epigenetic regulators can be inhibited it has been shown that a transcription factor involved in the expression of human genes can be blocked, noteworthy as any factor involved in gene expression which is is in error can cause cancer.   Stop this factor and cancer can be successfully fought.  Maybe.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div><br /></div>DECITABINE is one of the drugs that affect epigenetic processes.  The Economist article,  "Cancer's epicenter" describes the drug as a class of DNA methlytransferase inhibitor; therefore DNA would have little methylation. And, consequently,  this drug would be great in treating or limiting any deformed blood cells formed by the bone marrow.  This incidentally ls called Myelogenous Leukemia.  When Decitabine is used, the anti tumor effect reactivates epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor genes.  If tumor suppressor genes are reactivated there should be less tumors (cancer) and the anti-tumor ability is realized.<div><br /><div><br /></div></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>DNA methylation  can have enduring effects on the genome. And, remarkably these effects occur without DNA sequence changes. Consequently, drugs that have this effect can be used once and long lasting effects can happen as the DNA methyltransferase enzymes preserve the methyl marks initially caused in epigenetic formation.  Genetic sequencing of DNA is not effected.  These interventions may interfere with  times that extensive epigenetic reprogramming occurs so caution should be advised using these drugs during pregnancy and times around pregnancy.  These periods are called "sensitive periods of development"   As much of epigenetic reprograming occurs during this period of child development perhaps drug treatment during  s should probably not be used and caution should prevail.  Genetic abnormalities always need to be avoided.  Further, genetic abnormalities can be avoided by simple changes in the timing of the drugs.</span><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"> Methylation of  CpG islands is part of the parental imprint.  The paternal allele in germ cells are established during spermatogenesis.  Methylation imprints inherited from the parents are first erased in the male germ line in an early fetal state, established only later during spermatogonial differentiation.  This genomic imprinting is the epigenetic phenomenon by which certain genes are expressed in a parent of origin specific manner.  If the allele is inherited from the father is imprinted, it is silenced, and only the allele from the mother is expressed.  If the allele from the mother is imprinted then only the allele from the father is expressed.  Cancers, such as that found in a tumor found in the kidneys of children (Wilms tumor) has imprinting which is disrupted.  The H19 gene is expressed exclusively on one parental allele in imprinting and is only transcribed from the maternal  inherited allele.   The paternal allele is not expressed.  Specifically the hypermethylation of the the H19 promoter on the paternal allele allows expression of the paternal allele  IGF2.  Disrupting the imprinting at H19/ IGF2 contributes to cancer.  Hypermethylation occurs and both strands get expressed.  Consequently, the system gets twice the amount of Igfe, no dose of H19.<i></i></div>
