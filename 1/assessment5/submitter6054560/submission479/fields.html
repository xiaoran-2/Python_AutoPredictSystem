    <div class="field-value"><div>DNAmethylation in CpG dinucleotids, plays a key role in the control of gene activity and nuclear architecture. These CpG sites are not randomly distributed in the genome; CpG rich regions, known as CpG islands, are often associated with the regulatory region of many genes and are usually unmethylated in normal cells. This unmethylated state corresponds to the capacity of the CpG island of its associated genes transcribed in the presence of some transcriptional activators. However, there is a subset of CpG islands that are highly methylated in normal tissues, and often associated with tissue-specific genes, genes with genetic fingerprint and genes undergo inactivation of the X chromosome in females. Furtheremore, repetitive genomic sequences are also very methylated to protect DNA integrity (preventing chromosomal instability).</div><div><br /></div><div>Epigenetic alteration is an important feature in cancer. In normal tissue, methylation of a gene is mainly localized to the coding region,(CpG-poor). In contrast, the promoter region of the gene is unmethylated, despite a high density of CpG islands in the region. A Tumoral tissue shows "methylation imbalance" where genome-wide hypomethylation is accompanied by localized hypermethylation and an increase in expression of DNA methyltransferase: hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes and hypomethylation of oncogenes.</div><div>This loss is accomplished primarily through DNA hypomethylation of repetitive sequences and demethylation of bodies of the gene (coding regions and introns). Global DNA hypomethylation contributes to the origin of cancer cells through the generation of chromosomal instability, reactivation of transposable elements and loss of genetic fingerprinting. Most importantly, and is known as "DNA mathylation Paradox": is increase DNA CpG methylation  in the promoter CpG islands of many tumors supresor genes, inactivating these anti-cancer protein.</div><div> Disrup DNA methylation in intragenic region or repetitive elements leads to chromosome estability, and change the expression due to  loss of imprinting and reactivation of transposable elements.<br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Disorders in DNA methylation: silencing, hypermethylation CpG islands (as tumor suppressor genes), hypermethylation of CpG sets, Genome-wide hypomethylation (hypomethylation in oncogenes)  are some epigenome alterations that cause phenotypic changes (plasticity). These patterns are capable of transmission, inherited in cell division, persisted in genes(imprinting) or been reversible in front of some stimuli ( Drug therapy, for instance, or in a negative scenario, chemoresistance oncocells)</div><div><br /></div><div>Sensitive period is a maturational stage in lifespan, or embryonic stage , with intense metabolic activity during is especially sensitive to certain environmental stimuli or teratogenics factors. Senstive periods are: primordial germ cells development to the production of mature gametes and Preimpantation and early postimplantation period. Both active remodelling the epigenome. So, to treat a patient in a sensitive period would be inadvisable because little changes, drugs, experiments or alterations in the enviroment during these periods can induce enormous changes in the epigenome. In fact, experiments during sensitive periods of development influence DNA methylation patterns of several genes. These experience-induced DNA methylation patterns represent stable epigenetic modifications that alter gene transcription throughout the lifespan. </div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>Igf2 is  expressed on the maternal chromosome and is encoded Igfr2 receptor (Insulin-like Growth Factor 2 Receptor). When the receptor is in excess, joins Igf2. It exists in the second intron of this gene CpG island subjected to imprint. Under normal imprinting, gene promoter is active on the maternal chromosome and CpG island is methylated. Oposite,on  the paternal chromosome, the promoter is methylated CpG island. So,  in the first case the gene is expressed, while in the second the antisense RNA is expressed from gene CpG island.</div><div><br /></div><div> Loss of imprinting (LOI) of IGF2/H19 locus has been associated with tumorigenesis. In Wilms' tumour, imprinted expression of IGF2 is commonly relaxed resulting in maternal allele expression This is associated with increased methylation and reduced expression from the maternal copy of the tightly linked H19 locus.</div><div><br /></div><div> LOI of IGF2  is involved in neoplastic transformation. Patients with Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS) express both IGF2 alleles and are predisposed to several cancers</div><div>The mechanisms and methylation events underliyng  the LOI at H19 and IGF2 vary from tumour, however, maternal allele methylation is commonly acquired at sequences that include the H19 promoter and IGF2enhancer blocker which can simultaneously silenceH19 and activate IGF2 on the maternal chromosome</div></div>

    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:

        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
