    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><span>A CpG island is a aproximately 1000-kb stretch of DNA with GC content greater tan 50%,  and it occupy near 60% of human gene promoters. In normal tissue CpG islands show an hypomethylated pattern. In cancer cell genome CpG islands in promoter regions are highly hypermethilated. This hypermethylation silence tumor suppressor genes, which promotes progession of tumorigenesis. Moreover hypermethylation of other classes of genes as transcriptions factors, for example, can indirectly lead to tumorigenesis. This specific hypermethylation in CpG islands contrast with the genome wide DNA hypomethylation.  Normallly, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are heavily methylated. In cancer, those regions changes to hypomethylated, which conduce to Genomic Instability, through unstable transposition, deletions, insertions ,illegal recombination and activing cryptic promoters. </span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methyltransfereasa transfer a methyl group to DNA (methylation). Inhibition of methylations is a mechanism that could reduce tumorigenesis. Decitabine is a inhibitor of DNA methyltransferasa.  Low doses of decitabine, one of the four drugs targeting enzymatic epigenetic approved for FDA, could decrease  hypermethylation, by binding irreversiblely DNA methyltransfereasa. Decitabine is used in Myelodysplastic syndrome.</p><p><span> </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Unlike mutation, epigenetic changes are reversible. However once they are not reversed are mitotically  heritable. Then this is why drugs that alter  methylation have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment. Moreover this kind of drugs has unpredictable outcome during  sensitive periods. Sensitive periods are critical periods (early embryonic development and germ cell development) in which epigenetic marks are clearance and resetting ; those periods are highly susceptible to be altered with drugs or other external agents,  in a irreversible way, with consequences in next generations. For these reason it should consider seriously sensitive periods in pregnant women and younger patients.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Hypermethylation in cancer cells of Imprinted Control Regions (ICRs) lead a loss of imprinted. Genes that’s should be displaying monoallelic,  end up becoming either expressed from  both parental alleles or silent from both parental alleles. Many of the genes that are imprinted are involved in growth. Interestingly, hypomethylations can also occurred in cancer.  One example to explain hypermethylation in ICRs is the H19/Igf2 cluster. In this case, ICRs is unmethylated on the maternal allele, and methylated in paternal alle.  Normally CTCF will bind the unmethylated region in mother allele, and then enhacers localized  downstream and on H19, while Igf2 will be silent in this mother allele. In contrast, the paternal methylated ICR, and therefore CTCF can not bind, then theenhacers can act on Igf2. Pathologically, as happen in Wilm´s tomour, maternal ICRs is methyalated as it´s in paternal allele, which end up in double dose of Igf2. As Igf2 is a growth promoting, it contribute to tumorigenesis.</span></div>
