    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation - basic comonent of s everal epigenetic
phenomena – usually inversly correlates with gene expression at the promoter
regions, but CpG islands are exceptions. In general CpG islands are in the
promoters of tumor supressor genes. By the methylation of these CpG islands the
tumor supressor genes can be silenced. As the DNA methylation is mitotically
heritable, and epimutations are rapily selected, it is really effective.</p><p>In a normal cell the repetitive and intergenic regions of the DNA are hypermethylated, but in cancer they become hypomethilated. This hypomethylation leads to genetic instability. </p><p><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The common feature of cancer cells is the loss of imprinting, so the genes that should be displaying mono allelic expression, no longer show this „parent-of-origin-specific” expression. For Igf2H19, ICR is methylated on the paternal allele, and unmethylated on the maternal allele. CTCF binds the unmethylated (maternal) ICR, so enhancers act on H19, but Igf2 is silent. CTCF does not bind methylated ICR (paternal), so Igf2 is expressed. If the maternal allele is hypermethylated, it will also expresses Igf2, which is a growth promoter gene. The double dose of Igf2 causes Wilm’s tumor.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is DNA
methyltransferase inhibitor. ByDNA demethylating reactivates
epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor genes in vitro.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div><br /></div><div>DNA methylation is the basics of several epigenetic phenomena. It is involved in imprinting, X chromosome inactivation, etc.. It  is mitotically heritable, so changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. After that they do not return. It could be a way to stop cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.</div><div>To apply this kind of therapy the so called sensitive periods must be considered.  Epigenetic marks need to be cleared between generations. The epigenetic reprogramming has two waves, the pre-implantation period and the primordial germ cell development. During sensitive periods the effect can be unpredictable.</div><div><br /></div></div>
