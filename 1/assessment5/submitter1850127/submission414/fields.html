    <h1>Submission 414 from Anon (session_user_id: 183dbc39ced8f1faef8511ae864a579eb855dba1)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine (aka Dacogen) is a DNA-demethylating agent. It inhibits DNA methyltransferase which in effect leads to less DNA methylation (DNA hypomethylation) in the cell. The reason this may have an anti-tumor effect is that there are so-called tumor suppressor genes; genes which encode protein products which inhibit uncontrolled proliferation of cells that would lead to tumors. In a cancer patient, hypermethylation may lead to those tumor suppressor genes being methylated as thus silenced. Decitabine works against that effect.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at CpG islands is associated with the silencing of genes. Normally tumor surpressor genes are not silenced while oncogenes should be silenced by DNA methylation. In cancer CpG islands in promoter regions frequently become hypermethylated, leading to non-silencing (activation) of oncogenes.<br /><br />DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements prevents the transcription machinery from transcribing DNA which has no particular purpose. Transcribing useless DNA would be a waste of the cells finite resources. Therefore methylation of intergenic reasons and repetitive elements will prevent such a waste of resources.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In Wilm's tumor patients there is frequently a bipaternal epigenotype with the H19 gene being inactive and IGF2 being active on both alleles. The result of an over-expression of IGF2 and under-expression of H19. In plain words, there is too much growth-promoter and too little growth limitation, leading to uncontrolled growth of the tissue.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation patterns are mitotically heritable. That means that a change in the DNA methylation pattern which is caused by a drug will remain permanent in all cells in the treated tissue as those cells devide and the daughter cells (in that case the tumor cells) inherit the changed methylation pattern.<br /><br />A sensitive period is a time period during which DNA methylation is reset and re-programmed. Two typical sensitive periods are gametogenesis and the time right after fertilization.<br /><br />The treatment of patients with a drug that manipulates DNA methylation during sensitive periods is inadvisable because it would not only affect the actual patient who is being treated but also its offspring if DNA methylation patters in gametes or in an embryo are changed.<br /><br /></div>
