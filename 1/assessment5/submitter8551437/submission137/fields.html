    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at CpG islands can lead to gene silencing via MeCP proteins that help bind up the DNA into heterochromatin or, less commonly, methylated CpGs can directly block transcription factor binding and alter gene expression. In normal DNA, the CpG islands are largely unmethylated throughout the genome. <br /><br />However, cancer is characterized by aberrant hypermethylation of CpG islands. Tumor suppressor genes are especially likely to be hypermethylated, and this contributes to cancer by promoting cell growth. Less commonly, CpG poor promoters may be hypomethylated resulting in activation of oncogenes that likewise promote cell growth.<br /><br />In contrast, CpGs in intergenic regions and repetitive elements are typically methylated in normal DNA. The associated formation of heterochromatin leads to genomic stability. The tightly packed heterochromatin blocks RNA polymerase from accessing alternate transcription start sites, silences repeats, and defends against chromosomal translocations. Methylation is mutagenic, so it may even help to protect against repetitive elements by breaking them up over time.<br /><br />In cancer, we typically see genome-wide hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements. This leads to activation of cryptic promoters, activation of repetitive elements, and genomic instability which can contribute to cancer. For example, translocations may result in the activation of oncogenes or lead to loss of function in tumor suppressor genes. Cryptic promoters may enhance transcription of oncogenes.<br /><br />Finally, the role of DNA methylation in cancer is context dependent. Some tumors may be driven by CpG island hypermethylation and some may be driven by genomic instability. Additionally, the effects of aberrant methylation in cancer may be stage specific such as in early vs. late tumorigenesis.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The paternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated at the ICR and H19 promoter. Methylation on the ICR prevents CTCF binding which allows methylation to spread into the H19 promoter. This allows the downstream enhancers to access and activate the Igf2 gene. The maternal allele is unmethylated at both the ICR and the H19 promoter. This allows CTCF insulator protein to bind the ICR and blocks the enhancers from accessing Igf2, so Igf2 is not expressed from the maternal allele. Further, this results in the enhancers acting upon H19 instead of Igf2. <br /><br />In childhood tumors like Wilm's tumor, we see mutation or epigenetic disruption at the ICR of the H19/Igf2 cluster on the maternal allele causing it to behave like a paternal allele. Igf2 gets produced from both alleles causing an excess of growth promotion. Additionally, loss of function of the upstream Cdkn1c gene that is normally expressed from the maternal allele can exacerbate the situation.<br /><br />We can see a similar excess growth promotion contribution to cancer from the H19/Igf2 cluster when the maternal allele is hypermethylated and thus behaving like a paternal allele. In this case Igf2 is acting as an oncogene.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. More specifically, it is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi). The compound consists of nucleoside analogues that incorporate themselves into DNA upon replication and then irreversibly bind DNMT. This reduces the amount of methylation passed to daughter cells and is, therefore, replication dependent. The effects of Decitabine are dose dependent. In a large dose it has a toxic, nonspecific effect. At a lower dose it has an anti-neoplastic effect while minimizing side-effects on normal cells. While the mechanisms of action have not been fully elucidated, Decitabine primarily appears to have an anti-timor effect by inhibiting DNMT and thus reducing hypermethylation commonly found at tumor suppressor genes. Decitibane is<span> used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes (hematological, i.e., blood disorders), the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. These appear to be tumor suppressor dependent malignancies, which is consistent with Decitabine's role in reducing CGI methylation of tumor suppressor genes.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic mark that is mitotically heritable. Drugs that alter DNA methylation could have enduring effects on the epigenome that last beyond the period of drug treatment--potentially for the remaining life of the organism--because the alterations to DNA methylation would get passed on to daughter cells.<br /><br />Sensitive periods refer to periods of extensive epigenetic reprogramming. Mammals have two major sensitive periods: primordial germ cell (PGC) development and early embryonic stem cell (ESC) development. Researchers such as David Barker have also argued that there appears to be windows of epigenetic sensitivity to environment, albeit to a lesser degree than PGCs and ESCs, until age 2.<br /><br />Treating patients with drugs that alter DNA methylation during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because epigenetic disruptions during these periods could cause disastrous epigenome wide dysregulation. Treating pre-puberty males, for instance, could lead to incomplete clearing of epigenetic marks and disrupt imprinting in spermatogenesis. Treating pregnant women could be even more disastrous since not only could it affect her child, but it could also affect her grandchildren since PGCs are already present in the fetus. It could possibly even be fatal to the fetus by disrupting cell differentiation or affecting gene dosage.</div>
