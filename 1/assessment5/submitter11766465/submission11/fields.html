    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>In a normal cell, CpG islands are unmethylated in general and the introns, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated. </div><div>In constrast, in a cancer cell the CpG islands are more likely to be methylated than in a normal cell and the rest of the genome included the introns, the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements are hypomethylated.</div><div>The DNA methylation is associated with silencing. In cancer cells, we observe CpG island hypermethylation precisely in the promoter of tumour supressor genes which leads to their silencing. DNA methylation is mitotically heritable so it's a very effective to maintain tumour supressor genes silenced. </div><div>In a normal cell, the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements are silenced in order to maintain genomic stability. In early stages of tumogenesis, we observe a genome-wide hypomethylation. The hypomethylation leads to the decompaction of chromatin in these regions and then genomic instability (illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoter, disruption of neighboring genes).</div><span class="_wysihtml5-temp"></span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>One of the really common features of cancer cells is the loss of imprinting. </div><div>In deed, genes that should be displaying monoallelic parent-of-origin-specific expression, no longer show this imprint of expression but rather they become either expressed from both parental alleles or silent from both parental alleles. </div><div>It's probably because lots of imprinted genes are involved in growth (promotion or repression).</div><div>For example, we have hypermethylation of the H19/Igf2 cluster.</div><div>In a normal cell, this cluster is paternally imprinted which means that the ICR on the paternal allele is methylated whereas the maternal ICR is not. The methylation of ICR on the paternal allele prevents the fixation of the insulalor protein CTCF which leads to the expression of the Igf2 gene. In contrary, on the maternal allele, the lack of methylation on the ICR enable the fixation of CTCF. The Igf2 is the insulated from the enhancers who by default will interact with H19.</div><div>In a cancer cell, we have an hypermethylation of the H19/Igf2 cluster, the two allele behave like a paternal allele. This leads to an overexpression of Igf2, which is a growth promoter gene and the silencing of H19. This phenomena is associated with Wilm's tumor.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating or hypomethylation agent. Its hypomethylation activity is du its ability to inhibit DNA methyltransferase.</div><div>Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect by reducing the methylation level of DNA particulary in the CpG island of tumor-supressor genes "whose job is to stop the uncontrolled cell growth that causes cancer". -(Cancer’s epicentre)</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable so it's a very effective to pass epigenetic changes from a cell to its "daughter and granddaughter cells". It might be a way to "stop cancer without having to kill all its cells" -(Cancer’s epicentre)</div><div>There are two extremely sensitive periods for the human epigenome : the early development and the primordial germ development. That why we should be concern about giving those kind of treatment to younger patient particulary those that are developping germ cells because the epigenetic machinery is very sensitive to the environment during the epigenetic reprogramming.</div></div>
