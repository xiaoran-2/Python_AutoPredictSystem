    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Loss of imprinting can also contribute to the cancer We can take as an example imprinting</div><div>control region (ICR) H19/igf2 cluster in human chromosome 11.</div><div>In paternal allele the ICR is methylated  and it blocks binding insulator protein CTCF.</div><div>Without CTCF DNA methylation extends to H19 promoter an silences H19. But because of this</div><div>near enhancers  can access igf2 to activate it, igf2 is expressed. </div><div>In maternal allele ICR is not methylated and CTCF insulator protein binds to the ICR,</div><div>H19 is expressed and near enhancers acts on H19 not igf2. Because of this ig2 is silent.</div><div><br /></div><div>In case of loss of imprinting ICR in matternal allele is hypermethylated and both igf2</div><div>(paternal and maternal) are expressed. This way igf2 is over expressed.</div><div>Because igf2 is a growth promoting gene it leads to the tumour named Wilm's tumour.</div><div>Wilm's tumor is a kidneys cancer that typically take place  in children.</div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Since epigenetic changes are reversible there is hope that drugs targeting epigenetic machinery</div><div>can help with cancer. One of them is Decitabine.</div><div>It belongs to the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors class (DNMTi). Decitabine is US FDA approved</div><div>for Myelodysplastic syndrom. There are trials for other tumours though.  </div><div><br /></div><div>Generaly speaking when DMNT is incorporated to the DNA the inhibitor irreversibly binds DNMT.</div><div>Therefore it is dependent on replication. There is hope that it will be stronger effect on cancer cells</div><div>vs normal cells since cancerous cells replicate faster. The idea is to use the drug for cancers when</div><div>hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes are observable. Demethylating agent should decrease the amount of DNA</div><div>methylation and reverse 'epi-mutation' pattern of cancer growth.</div><div>The problem is what will happen in normal cells after introducing demethylating agent - side effects.</div><div>I understand it is not obvious yet in long term. But using this method for older patients can improve/prolong</div><div>life before long term side effects will be detectible.</div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>In many type of cancer there is observed alteration of DNA methylation.</div><div>As a example can be shown tumour suppressor gene with CpG islands.</div><div>CpG islands  are regions with a high frequency of CpG sites.</div><div>Many genes in mammalian genomes have CpG islands which are a promoter</div><div>regions (start of the gene). In normal cell usually  CpG island is unmethylated.</div><div>In cancer we observe in tumour suppressor genes that CpG islands can be hypermethylated</div><div>which leads to silencing of promoter and this way silence gene itself.</div><div>Since this is tumor suppressor gene as a consequence cell is loosing ability to control</div><div>tumours growth.</div><div><br /></div><div>Other epigenetic phenomenon detected with relation to cancer is hypomethylation of repetitive</div><div>elements and intergenic regions. In normal cell these elements are usually methylated.</div><div>Hypomethylation of repeats and intergenic intervals lead to genomic instability:</div><div>illegitimate recombination between repeats, deletion, insertion,...</div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Dr Stephen Baylin and his group at Johnson Hopkins School of Medicine used combination</div><div>of histone-deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine in advance lung cancer. They observed</div><div>slowing down of tumour growth. But also they observed very interesting lasting effect of the treatment.</div><div>Some of the participants of the trial did not have special response to the treatment itself</div><div>but they showed very good reaction to the standard chemotherapeutic drugs. You can speculate</div><div>that epigenetic treatment somehow changed the tumour cells stable way that made them more prone</div><div>to the regular therapy. Generally speaking alternations to epigenetic function can have lasting</div><div>effects since epigenetic changes are heritable during cell division. When the epigenetic mark is removed</div><div>it should not appear in the next generations of cells. Also if mark is added it should stay in all</div><div>new daughter cells. </div><div>The problem could appear in the epi-genetically sensitive periods though. They are two sensitive</div><div>periods for epigenetic marks: germ cell development  and early embryonic development.</div><div>In these periods epigenetics marks are cleared and back established to restore totipotency between generations.</div><div>Using epigenetic drugs in these periods can disturb epigenetic reprogramming between generations.</div><div>They are some examples of problems occurring when sensitive periods are disrupted:</div><div>assisted reproductive technologies, cloning, somatic cell reprogramming.</div><div><br /></div></div>
