    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is laid down by DNMT3 and DNMT3b in mammals. CpGs are clustered into a GpG island generally at the gene promoters; these islands tend to be protected from methylation but when methylation occurs it results in silencing of the gene expression, so it's considered as an inactivating epigenetic mark. In cancer, the global level of methylation decreases as a normal tissue goes through being a metastatic tissue, however CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated causing gene silencing and inactivation of tumour suppressing genes as well as giving cancer cells a particular "competitive advantage" over the surrounding ones, so cells that have this epimutation can divide more quickly and have a longer lifetime than the others. Due to the fact that CpG island hypermethylation is strongly associated with tumour suppressor genes silencing and it's the most common type of hypermethylation found in cancer cells, it can be used as a biomarker in diagnose, prognosis and monitoring of the disease. <br />In the other hand, while there has been observed that in cancer there's an hypermethylation of the CpG islands, the rest of the genome presents a global hypomethylation. The genome-wide hypomethylation consequences depend on the location that is being affected; repeats are considered as the most relevant and CpG poor promoters have been related with oncogene activation. A normal level of methylation in repeats and intergenic regions helps to keep genomic stability, so when demethylation happens, it can lead to instability problems like ilegitimate recombination between repeats causing deletions, translocations and insertions resulting in an abnormal kariotype. Activation of repeats and transposition may disrupt the coding region of a gene and it can also activate the neighbouring genes. <br />The implication of these concepts play a very important role in the effectiveness of epigenetic therapy in cancerous tumours with such etiology. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>The monoallelic expression of imprinted genes is controlled by ICRs and it's mechanism of action depends on each cluster. The </span>H19 / Igf2 cluster is found on chromosome 11 and it's controlled by an enhancer blocker. In normal individuals this cluster is paternally imprinted. When the ICR is unmethylated in the maternal allele, it's bound by the CTCF protein which insulates Igf2 from the downstream enhancers so they are free to act on H19 activating it's expression on the maternal allele; however in the paternal allele, because of the methylation CTCF can no longer bind, and the enhancers act on Igf2; so Igf2 should only be expressed on the paternal allele and H19 remains silenced. This cluster along with Kcnq1 are disrupted in Beckwith Widemann Syndrome which is known as an overgrowth syndrome causing predisposition to embryonic or childhood tumours like Wilm's kidney tumour. This imprinted disorder result from various abnormalities (mutation, deletion, UPD) in which the maternal allele acts like the paternal leading to a loss of the maternally expressed Cdkn1 tumour suppressor and an upregulation of Igf2 oncogene. The tumour suppressor expression loss and the overexpression of Igf2 oncogene generate a cancer predisposition in this patients. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine or Dacogen<span>® is part of the DNA demethylating agents and it's used as an anti-cancer chemotherapy drug as a treatment for myelodysplasic syndromes. An increase of DNA methylation can lead to a blockage of the tumour suppressor genes expression, so cell division becomes unregulated and it promotes cancer. Decatibine mechanism of action is by interfering with the methylation of the DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase, restoring the growth restricting genes function so the cell overgrowth gets controlled. Also, this drug acts as an antimetabolite; when this substance is incorporated into the cell's metabolism, it causes an interaction with multiple cell receptors causing a cytotoxic effect in the cell leading to apoptosis. This is meant to cause the death of cancerous rapidly dividing cells avoiding the cancer to keep growing and spreading to surrounding tissues. <br /><br /></span><span>National Cancer Institute.

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Due to the fact that DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark and epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable, the drug induced epigenetic changes are passed from mother cells to daughter cells and then granddaughter cells, so the effects can be seen through various cell generations even without the active use of the drug. <br />During a sensitive period, environmental changes like diet and chemical exposure including the use of drugs, are going to have the biggest effect on the epigenetic control. This sensitive periods of exposure occur during the establishment of epigenetic marks rather that during it's maintenance, so it happens during early development in pre-implantation and post-implantation periods and at the primordial germ cell development all the way through to the production of mature eggs and sperm. Both of these periods of active remodelling of the epigenome, involve a removal and laying down of epigenetic marks through different places in the entire genome. Also, in tissue-specific differentiation for each particular organ, there are small time windows in which these particular organs have as well very sensitive periods. Alterations on the epigenetic reprogramming result in epigenetic abnormalities, particularly aberrant imprinting so treating patients during this periods is strongly contraindicated. </div>
