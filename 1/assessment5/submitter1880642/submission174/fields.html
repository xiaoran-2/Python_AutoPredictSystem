    <div class="field-value">Normally DNA CpG islands are not methylated because methylation at CpG islands leads to silencing of gene expression. However, there are several exceptions when DNA methylation normally occurs. For example, during X chromosome inactivation in mammalian females. Besides, in normal cells DNA methylation also occurs at intergenic regions and repetitive elements. The functions of DNA methylation at intergenic regions is to maintain genomic integrity and some silencing of gene expression. Similar functions of DNA methylation occurs at repetitive elements.<br /><br />On the contrary, in cancer the situation is different. DNA CpG islands and neighboring 2kb areas around these islands (CpG islands shores) tend to be methylated while intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be non methylated. In cancer hypermethylation of CpG islands is frequently occurs in tumor suppression genes and leads to silencing of these genes expression. However, some CpG islands, that normally methylated, became hypomethylation in cancer. As a result the genes associated with these CpG islands become active. Besides, changes in DNA methylation (hypo- or hypermethylation) at imprint control regions (ICRs) can disrupt genomic imprinting. This leads to changes in parent-of-origin genes expression. In cancer DNA methylation also changes at intergenic regions and repetitive elements. Here hypomethylation leads to genomic instability, i.e illegitimate recombination between repeats, their activation and transposition.<br /><pre></pre><pre><br /></pre><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normally on the paternal allele an imprint control region (ICR) within H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated. Here methylation spreads to promoter of H19 gene and silences its expression. The methylated ICR cannot react with an insulator protein CTCF and thus cannot prevent the enchancers from reacting with Igf2 gene and allow this gene to be expressed. On the maternal allele the situation is different. Here the ICR is unmethylated and CTCF can bind to this region. Because of this binding, CTCF prevents the enhancers from reaction with Igf2. Thus, Igf2 cannot be expressed from the maternal allele.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumor an overexpression of Igf2 occurs. This is due to lost of parent-of-origin imprinting. Here hypermethylation of the ICR occurs on the maternal allele. So CTCF cannot bind to the ICR on the maternal allele anymore and cannot prevent the enhancers to react with Igf2 on the maternal allele. This leads to the expression of Igf2 from both paternal and maternal alleles and double the amount of Igf2 product within cancer cell as compared to normal one. Because the product of Igf2 is promoting growth, this leads to uncontrolled cell proliferation and development of a tumor.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">A few of anti-cancer drugs which affect epigenetic status of DNA are on the market. One of such drugs is Decitabine, a DNA-demethylating agent which is used in treating of myelodysplastic syndromes. The possible impact of Decitabine on cancer seems to decrease DNA methylation and hence to normalize expression of the genes that can be silenced due to DNA hypermetylation. Often tumor suppression genes are silenced because of DNA methylation of their promoter CpG islands. When unmethylated because of Decitabine action these genes can restore their expression and tumor suppressing function.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mechanism that regulates gene expression. Being established in early development, DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and maintained in future generations of cells. However, there are two sensitive periods in the development of a mammalian organism when DNA methylation is erased. These periods includes pre-impantation period of early embryonic development and the period of primordial germ cells development. Treating patients during this periods may has unpredictable consequences. For example, after the blastocyst stage when epigenetic marks are re-established in cell lineage specific manner, the substances altering DNA methylation may disrupt normal establishment of epigenetic marks. Besides, there are sensitive periods in the development of a particular organ when DNA methylation is erased and re-established. Altering of DNA methylation during this time may change normal epigenetic pattern of that particular organ and can seriously disrupt development of that organ or the whole organism. That is why treating pregnant women with DNA methylation altering drugs would be inadvisable.<br /><br /></div>
