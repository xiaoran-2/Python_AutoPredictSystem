    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Two representative aberrations in epigenetic control seen in
cancer are locus specific DNA hypermethylation (such as, at the CpG islands and
CpG island shores of tumour suppressor genes) and genome-wide DNA
hypomethylation (such as, at the repetitive elements and the intergenic regions).</p>

<p>CpG islands found in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes are
usually kept free of methylation in normal cells. However, they are hypermethylated
in cancer, which leads to the silence of tumour suppressors. Since DNA
methylation is mitotically heritable, silencing tumour suppressors are going to
allow that particular cell to have a competitive advantage over the others in
the surrounding tissues, then over a period of time, the cells that have this
epimutation are more likely to divide more rapidly, or to not die as much, and,
therefore, they will take over. And this contributes to cancer eventually.</p>

<p><span>The repetitive elements and the intergenic regions are methylated
in normal cells, so as to keep the genomic stability. But in cancer, these
regions tend to become hypomethylated. Hypomethylation of repeats/ intergenic
intervals may lead to illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of
repeats and transposition and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to
neighbouring genes. All these factors caused genomic instability and resulted
in cancer with time.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Given that lots of genes that are imprinted are involved in
growth, the hypermethylation or hypomethylation of imprint control regions (ICR)
are widely spread in cancer. Let’s take the insulator element (one type of ICR)
of H19/Igf2 cluster as an example. The maternally expressed H19 gene and
paternally expressed Igf2 gene share enhancers and their reciprocal imprinting
is governed by a CTCF-dependent insulator that is located between the genes. In
normal cells, it's methylated on the paternal allele, CTCF can’t bind this ICR and
the enhancers can act on Igf2 which will be expressed. Whereas, it’s
unmethylated on the maternal allele, CTCF will binds this ICR and the enhancers
will act on H19 leading to the silence of Igf2. However, the imprinting at the
H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour by hypermethylating of the ICR
on the maternal allele, leads to the overexpression of Igf2. Since Igf2 is
growth promoting, disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster will contribute
to cancer in the end.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer is related to DNA methylation abnormalities which lead to
activation of oncogenes or inactivation of tumour suppressors. Decitabine
belongs to DNA-demethylating agents. It could remove the DNA methylation at the CpG islands of
tumour suppressor genes, and thus activate the tumour suppressors. Therefore,
for patients with hypermethylation of the tumour suppressor genes, Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect by reducing the CpG
island <span>hypermethylation.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation belongs to one of the heritable epigenetic
mechanisms. Some RNA molecules (like miRNA or piRNA) may mediate the
transgenerational epigenetic inheritance through the gametes and help to
establish those marks differently when they're being established post
implantation. And the difference between transgenerational epigenetic
inheritance by the gametes and something that's established much later means we
can discriminate between when the most critical periods are in development. And
therefore, we can give the best advice in terms of health. Sensitive periods<span> are the periods of pre-implantation development and germ cell
development, and also the periods of epigenetic reprogramming: the clearing and
resetting of epigenetic marks. Since epigenetic changes are passed on during
cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively
erased, it’s inadvisable to treat patients during sensitive periods.</span></p></div>
