    <h1>Submission 32 from Anon (session_user_id: a665f0efc24723dfc142c4caf9ef80b8d6802fea)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA
methylation is an heritable epigentic mark, meaning it is retained during
mitosis. The enzyme DNMT1 binds hemimethylated DNA and  fills in the missing methylation marks at the
new synthesized DNA strand during replication. Therefore alterations in the epigenome in cancer cells that have been established during drug treatment will be retained in the
progressing cancer. By chance this epigenetic alteration in methylation pattern won't be lethal in the first place but
may make the cancer cell and its daughter cells more vulnerable to chemotherapy
even long after epigenetic drug treatment. </p>

<p>But there
are sensitive periods in development where epigenetic drugs should be avoided.
These sensitive periods are periods of epigenetic remodelling during primordial
germ cell development (oocyte maturation in young woman) and early
embryogenesis (from fertilization to blastocyst in early pregnancy), when most
epigenetic marks are actively removed and set new. At these sensitive periods
the environment / drugs can easily alter the epigenetic state and alterations may
have adverse effects on a patients offspring, because of alterations in imprinting
gene methylation etc.. Therefore treatment of children
and patients who wish to have children would be inadvisable, because of
potential adverse epigenetic alterations in their germ cells. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor. DNMT inhibitors are nucleoside analogs that are incorporated into the DNA and bind irreversibly to DNMTs, like DNMT1. DNMT1 is essential to maintain DNA methylation marks during mitosis, therefore DNMTi's are replication dependent. Inhibition of DNMT1 leads to hypomethylation in daughter cells, because methylation marks at newly synthesized DNA strands during cell replication can not be set by DNMT1. Decitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome, a haematological malignancy that is highly dependent on tumor suppressor gene hypermethylation, like other cancers. Hypermethylation of tumor suppressors leads to their inactivation and out of control cell growth. Due to drug treatment these hypermethylated regions can not be retained and tumor suppressor activation may be restored, taking care of normal cell growth. Althrough a clear mechanism of action is still unclear, other drug targets are imaginable.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> Imprinted genes are often
involved in cell growth, because it needs to be tightly controlled during all
stages of development. Otherwise uncontrolled cell growth happens, like we see
in tumors. Alterations
in imprinted control regions (like the H19/Igf2 ICR) that lead to overexpression
of growth promoting genes or loss of expression of growth restricting genes
is a common early event in cancer development.</p>

<p>Igf2/H19 is
an imprinted region, where DNA methylation occurs on the paternal CTCF binding
site between Igf2 and H19, thereby inhibiting CTCF binding. CTCF is an insulter
protein, insulting Igf2 from downstream enhancers. Without CTCF binding on the
paternal allele, methylation spreads to the H19 promotor and enhancers can
access Igf2 to activate gene expression.  The maternal allele is unmethylated at the
CTCF binding site. CTCF can bind, thereby insulting downstream enhancers to
reach Igf2 but enforcing H19 expression. </p>

<p>In Willm’s
tumor methylation occurs on both the maternal and paternal allele. CTCF cannot
bind to ether allele and Igf2 is expressed from both alleles, leading to a
double dose of Igf2 compared to normal cells. Igf2 is a growth promoting gene, which in cooperation with inhibition of tumor supressor genes is favourable for cancer development.<br /></p><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic alterations in cancer cells can be divided in genome-wide hypomethylation, including intergenic regions and repetetive elements, and locus specific hypermethylation at CpG islands. DNA methylation is a repressive epigenetic mark, therefore 
hypomethylation indicates active regions and hypermethylation leads to 
gene silencing.<br /><br />In general CpG islands are hypomethylated in normal tissue and are often found in promotor regions of tumor suppressor genes, thus activating them and maintaining normal cell growth. Hypermethylation of CpG island in cancer cells is often associated with tumor suppressor gene silencing, so no growth restriction can occur anymore, leading to excessive tumor growth. <br /><br />On the other hand, repetetive and intergenic regions are highly methylated in normal tissue to silence their activity and maintain genome stability. In cancer these regions are more likely to be demethylated and so activated. Activated repetetive and intergenic elements lead to genome instability with potential illegitimate recombination at repetetive elements with similarity to other regions in the genome and to activation of cryptic promotors by activated repeats and transposons. All these may lead to a altered karyotype (with chromosome insertion, deletion or translocation) with altered gene expression pattern, often found in cancer cells. All these alterations may lead to silencing of tumor suppressor genes or to an activation of oncogenes, both needed for cancer formation.<br /><br />Both epigenetic alterations can be favourable to cancer cell development, beeing one hit of several needed for cancer cell establishment. Both are found to progress with tumor growth and malignancy and both are found to some extent in all cancers, althrough specific epigenetic alterations may be stage specific in some cancers.<br /><br /><br /></div>
