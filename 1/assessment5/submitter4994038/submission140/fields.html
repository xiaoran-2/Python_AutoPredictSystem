DNA. DNA methylation is needed in normal development, and plays an important
role for epigenetic gene regulation of diseases, like cancer. DNA methylation
at the 5 position of cytosine can reduce gene expression. The epigenome of
cancer will display alterations when compared to a normal genome. Changes in
DNA methylation will include genome-wide loss and a gain of DNA methylation;
causing genomic instability and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted
genes and can silence tumour suppressor genes. </p><p><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">These genes normally</span>
</p><p>control the cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair and this occurs by
hypermethylation of the promoter CpG islands. CpG islands are hypomethylated
and the intergenic regions, introns and repetitive elements are hypermethylated.
There tends to be a reversal in this pattern in cancer; this can lead to
problems as tumour suppressor genes can be silenced, allowing the cell to
divide more rapidly and grow into a tumour. </p><p><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">In primordial germ cells,</span>
</p><p>the greatest loss of methylation is observed in introns, intergenic regions and
repeats, also in exons and promoters. Nucleosomes are enriched in exons
compared to introns- the majority of DNA methylation occurs in intragenic or
intergenic regions; the majority of methylated CGIs are associated with genes,
and 32% of all methylated CGIs are intergenic. </p><p>
<span>In cancer, genomic hypomethylation can lead to genomic instability and
activation of oncogenes. This can affect repetitive sequences, imprinted genes
and genes involved with invasion and metastases- tumour suppressor genes are
silenced and hypermethylated. Tumours seem to accumulate higher levels of DNA
methylation in tumour progression- and these defined alterations are used as
biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction of therapy response for
types of cancers. </span><br /></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p><span>In
diploid organisms, somatic cells possess 2 copies of the genome. Each autosomal
gene is represented by two copies or alleles with one copy from each parent at
fertilisation. H19 is a gene for a long noncoding RNA and has a role in cell
proliferation and negative regulation/limit of body weight. The H19 gene is
expressed exclusively on one parental allele, from the maternally inherited
allele; the paternal H19 allele is not expressed. Hyper- and hypomethylation at
the IGF2-H19 imprinting control region result in changes in expression and 2
different disorders. The ICR at IGF2 and H19 is normally methylated on the
paternal allele; methylation is excluded from the maternal allele by the
binding of CTCF.  The CTCF complex wont
bind to the paternal allele because of the methyl marks, that silence the H19
gene as the enhancers drive the expression of Igf2. In a normal cell you observe
a normal dose of H19 from the mother and Igf2 from the paternal, but when ICR
becomes hypermethylated, both strands appear of paternal origin and both are
expressed, treating the cell to a double dose of growth promoting Igf2- Wilm’s
tumour. Hyper-proliferation is one indication of cancer.  </span></p><p><span>Lecture Notes</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;

    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a drug that
belongs to a class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors and can contribute to
the hypomethylation of DNA. This is beneficial in treating a condition named myelodysplastic
syndrome (conditions in which the bone marrow can produce deformed blood
cells)- this syndrome is a precursor to acute myelogenous leukaemia.(Kantarjian, 2006). Decitabine, the anti-tumour effect is linked to the re-activation of silenced
tumour suppressor genes, induced by hypomethylation. It does this by inhibiting
DNA methyltransferase- it can be incorporated into DNA strands. </span></p><p>Economist article</p><p>Kantarjian H, Issa JP, Rosenfeld CS et al. (April 2006).

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.

    <div class="field-value"><span>DNA
methyltransferase enzymes preserve methyl marks in mitosis. DNA methylation is
used as a form of regulation in treatments as it can be manipulated and due to
the effects of the DNA methyltransferase enzymes. These interventions can interfere
with ordinary functions, particularly in critical periods, periods where
extensive epigenetic reprogramming can occur. It is inadvisable to prescribe these
treatments to pregnant mothers (even a few months before conception) as
reprogramming is key in early child development, and in the formation of male
and female gametes.<br /><br />Economist Article<br />Lecture notes</span></div>
