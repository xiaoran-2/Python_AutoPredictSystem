    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>In general, in a normal cell, we have a hypomethylated
GpG island and a genome methylated in the repetitive elements, through the
intergenic regions and in the introns of genes.  In a cancer cell the GpG islands are more
likely to be methylated then in a normal cell, and the rest of the genome are,
in general, hypomethylated. Therefore, there is a reciprocal cross of the DNA
methylation between the normal and the cancer cells.</span></p><p>The CpG island hypermethylation are most
observed on the promoters of tumor suppressor genes causing the silencing of those
genes by locking in a silent inactive state that is mitotically heritable.  The GpG island hypermethylation and consequent
epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes allow the cell to divide more
rapidly, outcompete its neighboring cells, and grow into a tumor. The genome
hypomethylation is associated with grater genomic instability. This instability
increase the probability of copying errors to occur, such as deletions,
insertions and translocations in the chromosomes. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The H19/Igf2 locus in a normal cell has a
methylated paternal allele at the ICR and in consequence of this methylation
the CTCF complex does not bind to this allele, which leads to silencing of the
H19 gene and the enhancer acting on increase the expression of Igf2. Also in a
normal cell, the maternal allele has no methylation, allowing the CTCF complex
to bind and leading the enhancer to act on the H19 gene as a result. Therefore,
it is possible to observe a normal expression in both Igf2 and H19 proteins
defined from the paternal and maternal strand respectively, characterizing the
normal imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster. </span></p><p><span>If this
imprinting is disrupted, with ICR hypermethylation, both strands appears to be
of paternal origin resulting in an Igf2 overexpression as well as no expression
of H19. The Igf2 is a growth promoting protein and this expression pattern, resulted
from the disrupted imprinted at the H19/Igf2 cluster, contributes to cancer and
is associated with Wilm’s tumor.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, which means that this drug acts
inhibiting the DNA methyltransferase leading to a hypomethylation of the DNA. Tumors
seem to accumulate higher levels of DNA methylation during tumor progression,
especially in the GpG islands on the promoters of tumor suppressor genes. Therefore,
by inducing hypometylation the Decitabine can cause a reactivation of this epigenetically
silenced tumor suppressor genes.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Epigenetic
changes, such </span>as altering DNA methylation, are passed during cell division to daughter
and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased by the use of epigenetic
drugs. Once erased, they do not return. However, the epigenetic changes caused
by the use of such drugs do not occur only on cancer cells, but genome-wide,
and may interfere with functioning of the normal cells, especially during
sensitive periods when intensive epigenetic reprogramming is occurring. The
most known sensitive periods are in child early development (during early gestation
and even a few month before conception) and during the germ cells development
(formation of both female and male gametes). Therefore using drugs that cause epigenetic alteration on patients
during such periods would be inadvisable as it could cause serious side effects
in all other non-tumor tissues. </p></div>
