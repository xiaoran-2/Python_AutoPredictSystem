    <h1>Submission 299 from Anon (session_user_id: f9ae5aceed31136e0b86e6cb392128acf24ccdb0)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the DNA-demethylating or DNA methyltransferase inhibitor class which are nucleoside analogues which irreversible bind DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA, therefore are replication dependent. This affects cancer cells more severely because they replicate more rapidly. Decitabine and other drugs in it class kill cancer cells at low doses by causing DNA methylation in most cases. It is hypothesized that they might also work through other mechanisms. Decitabine is of use in myelodisplastic syndromes which are characterized by CpG islands hypermethylation particular in tumor supressor genes, when the hypermethylation is counteracted then the tumor supression genes can be expressed appropriately.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">This is because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable as explained by Dr Baylin 'epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased'. The sensitive period refers to the time when the epigenetic marks are being established or reprogrammed this happens in germ cell development and during early embryonic development  (blastocyst stage). Treating patients during germ cell development could be inadvisable because it is a period that is highly regulated and altering DNA methylation particularly in those patients with cancer in early life could lead to germ cell abnormalities.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal tissues, CpG islands are hypomethylated while the genome in general is methylated in the repetitive elements, intergenic regions and in gene's introns. In cancer, the CpG islands become hypermethylated generally in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes, this silences tumor suppressor genes which in turn facilitates tumor growth. The hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements was the first epigenetic abnormality found and occur to some extent in every tumor. The hypomethylation in the repetitive elements leads to genomic instability which in turn promotes illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes. Hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters can result in activation of genes such as the R-RAS in gastric cancer or PTEN in glioma.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The imprint control region in the Igf 2 paternal allele is methylated which leads to the enhancers bypassing H19 and act on Igf2 which leads to Igf2 expression. On the other hand the maternal allele is unmethylated which leads to binding to CTCF insulatro to the imprint control region leading to enhancers working on the H19 which is then expressed, while Igf2 is silenced. In Wilm's tumor there is hypermethylation of the imprint control region on the maternal allele as well which leads to expression of Igf2 giving a double dose of Igf2. Since Igf2 is a growth promoter it leads to the appearance of tumors.</div>
