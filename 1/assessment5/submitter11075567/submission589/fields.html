    <h1>Submission 589 from Anon (session_user_id: 75e45889f958ae14aaad65445bcef2b1019068cf)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the class of inhibitors known as Azanucleosides. Decitabine, along with its sister compound 5-Azacitidine, are the foundation for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes(MDS). Decitabine is a deoxycytidine analong in which the usual C5 Carbon found in the pyrimidine ring of nucleotides is replaced with a nitrogen atom. This replacement causes the covalent entrapment and there by the inactivation of DNA methylating enzymes such as DNMTs. The depleetion of DNMT activity causes a reduction of DNA methylation (hypometylation).  After multiple exposure to Decitabine , the abnormal methylation of the CpG islands is reversed. This leads to the decondensation of chromatin, allowing the re-expression of silenced genes and production of tumor suppressor proteins. It is believed this hypomethylation, followed by the re-ecpression of key tumpr suppressors, is what brings about the clincal results.<br />PMID 20551943<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Generally, CpG islands are not methylated and found often in the promotor regions of tumor suppressor genes. In many cancers, it has been seen that these CpG islands are hypermethylated. This hypermetylation leads to the inactivation of nearby tumor suppressing proteins, which over time becomes more methylated. On the other hand, in regular cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated,  in order to help maintain genomic stability. In cancer, these regions are hypomethylated, more commonly in repeats, and lead to genomic instability or activation/transposition of various genes. Hypomethylation of CpG islands is also an element in cancer, since this lack of methylation leads to the activation of oncogenes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"> <br />In epigentics, a senstive period is a time of epigenetic reprogramming, where epigentic marks that have layed out are removed and finally re-established. These senstitive periods can be influenced by environmental factors.<br />During development, reprogramming occurs pre-implantation and again during primordial germ cell development. Since epigentic marks are genetlically heritable, treatment with drugs during these sensitive periods could have detrimental effects on the epigenetic state of certain genes. As has been shown in the case of the Agouti mice, treatment with certain substances can lead to hyper or hypo methylation.   </div>
