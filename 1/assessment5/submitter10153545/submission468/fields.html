    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><ul><li><p>Describe
	the normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.</p>
</li></ul><p>CpG
islands are found in about 60% of promoters and are usually kept free
of methylation independent of the activity state of
the associated promoter(s)/gene(s)<br /></p>
<ul><li><p>Describe
	how DNA methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.</p>
</li></ul><p>
In
cancer cells promoter CpG islands and shores tend to
become hypermethylated. This  hypermethylation tends to increase as the cancer
progresses</p>
<ul><li>
<p>
	Explain
	how disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to
	cancer.</p>
</li></ul><p>The island hypermethylation can
silence associated
tumour suppressor genes. These genes protect a cell from
one step on the path to cancer.
They often have
a damping or repressive effect on the regulation of the cell cycle or
promote apoptosis,
so
their silencing encourages a cancerous state.<br /></p>
<ul><li><p>Describe
	the normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and
	repetitive elements.</p>
</li></ul><p>CpGs
in these regions are normally heavily methylated so that the DNA is
heterochromatinised. This makes the DNA stable and prevents
recombination between repeats as well as their transposition which
could be damaging.<br /></p>
<ul><li><p>Describe
	how DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is
	disrupted in cancer.</p>
</li></ul><p>Increasing
hypomethylation of repeats and intergenic intervals occurs as cancer
progresses. There is also hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters.<br /></p>
<p>
 
</p>
<ul><li>
<p>
	Explain
	how disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and
	repetitive elements contributes to cancer.</p>
</li></ul><p>Hypomethylation of
repeats in intergenic intervals contributes to cancer by causing
genomic instability as it leads to removal of the heterochromatin
state which allows illegitimate recombination between repeats as well
as their activation and transposition. Hypomethylation and subsequent
loss of the heterochromatin state of intergenic
regions can also
cause activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes. Also, hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters can
result in activation of genes such as oncogenes.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li><p>Describe
	the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this
	determines Igf2 expression status.</p>
</li></ul><p>
The
paternal allele imprint control region (ICR) is methylated so the
CTCF protien cannot bind to it and so does not insulate Igf2 from the
enhancers so Igf2 is expressed instead of H19</p>
<ul><li>
<p>
	Describe
	the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this
	determines Igf2 expression status.</p>
</li></ul><p>
The
maternal allele ICR is unmethylated so the CTCF protien binds to it
and so insulates Igf2 from the enhancers so Igf2 is not expressed.
Instead the enhancers act on H19, which is expressed.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>
	Describe
	how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s
	tumour.</p>
</li></ul><p>
In
Wilm’s tumour you get hypermethylation at the ICR on the maternal
allele as well, so the maternal allele ends up also expressing Igf2.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>
	Explain
	how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to
	cancer.</p>
</li></ul><p>
<span>As
both paternal and maternal alleles are expressing Igf2 in  Wilm’s
tumour, you get a double dose of Igf2 compared to a normal cell. Igf2
is growth promoting and so contributes to the cancer.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>
<p>
	Identify
	the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.</p>
</li></ul><p>
Decitabine
is
a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor
(DNMT
inhibitor)
It
hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferases</p>
<ul><li>
<p>
	Describe
	the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.</p>
</li></ul><p>
<span>It
hypomethylates DNA in replicating
cells,
ie it causes a decrease in DNA methylation.</span></p>
<ul><li>
<p>
	Describe
	how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.</p>
</li></ul><p>
<span>In
some cancers excessive methylation of
CpG islands can silence tumor
suppressor genes
which
contributes to the growth and
survival of the cancer.
Hypomethylating agents like Decitabine
decrease DNA methylation and so
may disrupt these patterns (reactivate tumor suppressor genes).</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li><p>Describe
	how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
	epigenome.</p>
</li></ul><p>
DNA
methylation is mitotically heritable. This means if a cells DNA
methylation state is changed then that cells daughter cells will
inherit those changes and so on down the line, hence enduring.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>
	Define
	what is meant by a sensitive period.</p>
</li></ul><p>
These
are periods when epigenetic reprogramming is taking place in cells. 
</p>
<ul><li>
<p>
	Identify
	sensitive periods of development.</p>
</li></ul><p>
The
sensatve periods are during primordial
germ cell development and the pre-implantation period  of early
embryonic development 
</p>
<ul><li>
<p>
	Explain
	why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.</p>
</li></ul><p>During
these periods epigenetic
reprogramming is taking place. This involves clearing of epigenetic
marks and reprogramming of imprinted genes in germ cell development
and clearing of epigenetic marks and reprogramming in early embryonic
development. Disruption of epigenetic reprogramming with drugs that
affect the epigenetic machinery at these times would have major and
disastruous effects on any resulting organism.</p></div>
