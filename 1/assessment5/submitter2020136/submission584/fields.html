    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The global level of DNA methylation
decreases as tissue progresses from normal to metastatic, but methylation at
some CpG-islands becomes denser. </p><p>In most normal cells CpG-islands are
unmethylated or hypomethylated. </p><p>CpG islands are more likely to be
methylated (not all) in cancerous cells, and recently it has been discovered
the CpG island shores are also hypermethylated in cancer. </p><p>Disruption of DNA methylation at CpG
islands contributes to cancer through the activation of oncogenes or
inactivation of tumour suppressors.</p><p><span>Methylation of CpG islands in the
promoter of tumour suppressor gene, can silence the gene or lock it in an
inactive state due to the mitotic heritability of epigenetic marks. This occurs
frequently in human cancers and has been found to occur in all cases of cancer.  Tumour suppressor
hypermethylation is often more frequent than genetic mutations.  CGI hypermethylation varies between tumour
types.</span></p><p>The majority of DNA in cells is
composed not of CpG islands but intergenic regions, and in most normal cells
intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated.</p><p>Intergenic regions, introns and
repetitive elements are hypomethylated in cancer cells. Hypomethylation of
intergenic regions has historically been the earliest epigenetic abnormality
found in cancer patients, and is found to some extent in all cancers.
Hypomethylation of intergenic regions occurs most commonly at repeats, and is
rarer elsewhere (e.g. CpG poor promoters).</p><p>Hypomethylation of repeats and
intergenic intervals contributes to genomic instability. This leads to
illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and
transposition, and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to
neighbouring genes.</p><p>

</p><p><span>Hypomethylation can activate repeats,
which means they can make copies of themselves and transpose themselves
elsewhere in the genome. This may disrupt a gene or possibly activate a
neighbouring gene. Illegitimate recombination can also occur as deletions or
insertions, and in general contributes to genomic instability.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprint control region of the
paternal allele is methylated in a normal cell. CTCF cannot bind to the imprint
control region and insulate Igf2, and Igf2 is therefore expressed while H19 is
silenced.</p><p>The imprint control region of the
maternal allele is unmethylated in a normal cell. This allows CTCF to bind the
insulator element. The downstream enhancers will act on H19 and Igf2 will not
be expressed.</p><p>In Wilm’s tumour, the imprint control
region in both the maternal and paternal allele is methylated, resulting in
expression of Igf2 from both alleles. The growth promoting Igf2 is now
expressed at twice the level of a normal cell.</p><p><span>Alterations in DNA methylation (hypo-
or hypermethylation) at ICRs can result in the loss of expression of growth
restricting genes and over expression of growth promoting genes. In cancer
cells there is a switch from parent of origin specific expression of imprinted
genes to a state in which both alleles of the gene are expressed or silenced.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is DNA-demythylating agent.</p><p>Decitabine hypomethylates DNA by
inhibiting DNA methyltransferase.  </p><p><span>Demethylation of CpG
islands in the promotors of tumour suppressors can activate the tumour suppressors.
CpG islands are more likely to be methylated in cancerous cells. </span><br /></p><p><span><br /></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic marks such as DNA
methylation are mitotically heritable and are transmitted between successive
generations of cells until they are actively erased.</p><p>Sensitive periods are periods of
epigenetic reprogramming where epigenetic marks are cleared and reset. These
periods are sensitive to environmental signals.</p><p>The periods of pre-implantation and
germ cell development are sensitive periods.</p><p><span>Epigenetic marks are being actively
set and reset during this time which makes DNA more susceptible to epigenetic
reprogramming in general. Small environmental signals could therefore have an effect
on a wide number of genes. For example, key developmental genes could easily
become epigenetically silenced and have a dramatic impact on cell viability.
Further, because epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable, any epigenetic abnormality
acquired during a sensitive would likely be maintained in all future cells
derived from the original affected cell.</span></p></div>
