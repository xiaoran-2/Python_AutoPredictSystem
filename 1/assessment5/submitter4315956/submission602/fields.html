    <div class="field-value">In cancer, the DNA is hypermethylated in CpG islands and hypomethylated in intergenic and repetitive regions.<br /><br />The CpG islands are common in promotor sequences. Usually they are unmethylated, however they are methylated in inactive X chromosome and in some silenced genes. The methylation led to silencing by formation of a repressive chromatin structure or by prohibition of transcription factor binding. Cancer causes hypermethylation in CpG islands, and this can silence tumour suppressor genes, which favours the cancer development. The identity of  hypermethylated CpGs islands varies by tumour type, then this can be used for diagnosis, prognosis and monitor tumour.<br /><br />The DNA methylation in intergenic regions is important to silence cryptic transcription start sites. Instead, the <span>repetitive elements methylatyon prevents transposition and ilegitimate recombination. Cancer causes genome-wide hypomethylation of intergenic and repetitive regions, which causes genomic instability and can generate deletion, insertion or reciprocal translocation. The hypomethylation is in all tumour types tested and progresses with tumorigenicity.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The <i>H19/Igf2</i> cluster is imprinting regulated. In the paternal allele, the Imprint Control Region (ICR) is methylated. The methylation spreads to <i>H19</i> promoter, silencing it expression. Consequently, the downstream enhancers can access and active <i>Igf2</i>, an oncogene (growth promoting).<br /><br />In the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated and can be coated by CTCF. It is an insulator protein that insulates <i>Igf2</i> from downstream enhancers. Therefore, the maternal allele usually doesn't express the <i>Igf2</i> gene and only <i>H19</i> gene is expressed. <br /><br />One common early event in the cancer development (often seen in pre-neoplastic tissue) is the methylation of <i>H19/Igf2 </i>cluster ICR. How the ICR become methylated in both allele (pattern like paternal allele), both ICR can't be coated and there are overexpression of <i>Igf2, </i>an oncogene that can favour the tumorigenicity.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
