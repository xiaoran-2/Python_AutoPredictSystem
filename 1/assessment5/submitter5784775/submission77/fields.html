    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands can have a methyl group added to the 5' carbons of the cytosines  These CpG islands normally become methylated as a person ages.  These CpG islands are sometimes imbedded in tumor suppressor genes. They are normally hypomethylated in healthy cells, allowing the tumor suppressor genes to be active.  In some cancers these regions become hypermethylated.  The areas around these CpG islands, the CpG island shores, can also become hypermethylated.  Hypermethylation can contribute to cancers by silencing the tumor suppressor genes.  This silencing can be more common than mutations in some cancers.  Examples of cancers in which CpG islands can be methylated include a retinoblastoma, a type of colorectal cancer, some breast cancers, and a type of glioma.  </p><p>In healthy cells intergenic regions and repetitive elements are often hypermethylated.  They can become hypomethylated in cancers.  This can contribute to cancer by causing genomic instability and oncogene activation. Genomic instability can be caused by repeats being activated and making copies of themselves. They can move about the genome causing chromosome deletions, reciprocal translocations, and insertions. In some cases oncogenes can become activated due to this genomic instability. Examples include the activation of the R-RAS gene in gastric cancer and the production of microRNAs that target tumor suppressor genes in certain gliomas.    </p><p>CpG methylation can vary with tumor type and also with the aggressiveness of a tumor.  Methylation of CpG islands can therefore be used as biomarkers for diagnosis of the type of cancer a person has.  They can also be used to give a prognosis of a patient because a greater degree of hypermethylation can lead to increased tumorgenicity and a poorer prognosis.  CpG island methylation can also be used to monitor the progress of a patients disease.   </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The Igf2 and H19 genes are found on chromosome 11.  In paternal genes of healthy cells the imprint control region is methylated.  This prevents an insulator protein - CTCF - from bonding.  This in turns allows enhancers to activate and the Igf2 gene.  This gene is a growth promoter. </p><p>In maternal genes the imprint control region is not methylated, allowing the CTCF insulator protein to bind to this gene.  This insulator protein prevents enhancers from operating on the Igf2 gene.  The H19 gene, which is downstream from the enhancer is now unmethylated, allowing that gene to be active. This H19 gene is a tumor suppressor.  In healthy cells this results in one growth promoter gene and one tumor suppressor gene to be activated, resulting in normal growth.    </p><p>Wilm's tumor is childhood tumor of the kidney. In a patient with Wilm's tumor the imprint control region and the H19 genes are methylated on both the maternal the paternal chromosomes.  This results in a double dose of Igf2, a growth promoter, and lack of expression of H19 a tumor suppressor. Double doses of a growth promoters can not only lead to Wilm's tumor but other forms a cancer as well.        </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. It is used in for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome.   DNA methyltransferases are nucleoside analogues.  They irreversibly bond to DNA methyltransferases after they are incorporated into DNA. The function of these drugs is replication dependent so they will have greater effect on faster growing tissue like tumors than on other tissues.  The drug is not tumor specific however, so it can have toxic effects on fast growing cells found, for example, in hair follicles and the lining of the small intestine.   </p><p>Decitabine is used at relatively lower does where its antineoplastic effects is greatest and its toxic effects are kept to a minimum. Its mechanism of action is unclear.  it is thought that in hematological malignancies like myelodysplastic syndrome the disease is dependent on tumor suppressor gene hypermethylation. A DNA methyltransferase inhibitor may help prevent this hypermethylation       </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can have lasting effects on a genome because it is mitotically heritable. Treating patients with drugs that effect methylation will not only have an effect on the cells present at the time of drug administration but also effect any cells they produce.  Standard cancer chemotherapy can effect cells in the patient at the time of drug delivery but not any future cells.   </p><p>Methylation is most prevalent during two phases of life,  These are known as sensitive periods. These two periods are early in embryonic development and during germ cell development. In these sensitive periods much of the previous DNA methylation is cleared and then new patterns of methylation are created.  </p><p>Giving patients drugs that effect DNA during sensitive periods will effect the methylation in any of a patient's cells and could effect any portion of a patient's epigenome.  This could have adverse effects on development in an embryo and be passed on to future generations if it effects methylation in germ cells.  Giving a pregnant woman drugs that effect DNA methylation could effect three generations; herself, the offspring she is carrying, and any progeny of that offspring.     </p></div>
