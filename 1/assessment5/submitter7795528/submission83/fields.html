    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>DNA methylation at CpG islands indicates that the promoter of the corresponding gene is turned off. This is what is found in cancer at tumor suppressor genes, in contrast to the situation which holds in normal cells, where tumor suppressor genes are turned on.  On the other hand, the normal hypermethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements, which turn these off, contributes to genetic stability.  Cancerous cells are found to be hypomethylated in the intergenic regions and repetitive elements, which unsurprisingly leads to unstable genetic behavior, one of the hallmarks of cancer. For example, the repetitive elements can now propagate, perhaps disrupting the functions of important genes.</div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div><div>Normal cells may exhibit “imprinting,” whereby methylation marks turn off expression of either the maternal or paternal alleles of a particular gene. The Igf2 gene is normally maternally imprinted, so only the paternal gene is turned on.  In cancerous cells imprinting may be disrupted at the ICR (imprinting control region) so that imprinting is lost.  In the case of Wilm’s tumor, loss of imprinting leads to overexpression of the gene’s insulin-like growth factor, stimulating growth of tumor cells.</div></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, that is, it acts to counter and reduce DNA methylation at CpG island sites.  In cancerous cells helpful genes such as tumor suppressors have been turned off by such methylation marks.  Removing these marks means that when such a cell divides mitotically, the daughter cells now have their tumor suppressor genes active.  Furthermore, subsequent rounds of chemotherapy show “unexpectedly good reaction,” possibly because the drug alters tumor cells in such a way as to make them more susceptible to chemotherapy.[1]</div><div><br /></div><div>[1] “Cancer's epicentre.”, The Economist  (2012, 7th April.)</div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Epigenetic marks are mitotically inheritable, that is, during cell duplication they are more or less faithfully copied.  Thus the alteration of DNA methylation by drugs affects not only the treated cell, but its ancestors: a drug’s effects persist over generations. Development features several “sensitive periods,” windows of time during which the cell’s epigenetic marks are reset.  These sensitive periods are the during the development of the primordial germ cells (the sperm and eggs in males and females, respectively); and the pre- and post-implantation periods of embryonic development. It is known that serious disease conditions such Prader-Willi and Angelman syndrome are the result of disruption of methylation marks (in these cases, imprinting marks) during the primordial germ cell development sensitive period.  Thus it might be expected that treating patients with DNA methylation drugs during these periods might well have serious unintended consequences outside of the targeted genes.</div><div><br /></div></div>
