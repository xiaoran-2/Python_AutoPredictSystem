    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation refers to the addition of a
methyl (CH3) group to the cytosine or guanine nucleotides. This methyl group
may be added to the fifth carbon atom of the "Cytosine" base or the
sixth nitrogen atom of the "Guanine"  base.</span></p><p>This modification of the DNA alters the
genes expressed in cells when they divide and differentiate from embryonic
stem cells into cells of a particular tissue. </p><p>A CpG island are clusters of dinucleotides
often found at promoters of genes. Al though CpG islands have a high occurrence
of Cytosine and Guanine, CpG islands tend to be protected from DNA methylation.
DNA methylation of CpG islands will result in silencing of the gene expression.</p><p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements  of a gene are usually methylated. This is done
in order to maintain genomic stability. So that during transcription of the
gene there will be less mistakes (transpositions, transcriptional interference
of illegitimate recombination’s) because mistakes will lead to genomic
instability.<br /></p><p><span>In cancer often the CpG  islands undergo hypermethylation, adding DNA
methylation to the CpG islands. Because DNA methylation of CpG islangs results
in silencing of gene expression, this will make a cell function different than
before. The DNA methylation can be passed on to daughter cells during cell
division, which will give more cells that function different than before.</span></p><p>











</p><p><span>In cancer often the Intergenic regions and repetitive
elements undergo hypomethylation, removing DNA methylation of the Intergenic
regions and repetitive elements. The Intergenic regions and repetitive elements
 are methylated to keep genomic stability,
if the methylation is removed this will make the cells genomic instable. Because
during transcription there is a lot more gene to transcribe the when Intergenic
regions and repetitive elements  are
methylated which will increase the change of mistakes.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Around the H19/Igf2 locus ordinarily there
is methylation of the paternal allele at the ICR, and no methylation for the
maternal allele. </p>

<p>The CTCF complex binds to the allele on the
maternal strand and the downstream enhancers act on H19 as a result. </p>

<p>The CTCF complex does not bind to the
paternal allele due to the methyl marks, which leads to silencing of the H19
gene as the enhancers instead drive expression of Igf2. </p>

<p>In a regular cell there will be a normal
dose of both H19 from the maternal allele and Igf2 from the paternal allele. </p>

<span>When ICR becomes hypermethylated, as in Wilm's
tumour,  a cell will have two dose of Igf2,
which is growth promoting, from maternal and paternal allele and no dose of H19.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine Is DNA-demethylating agent using
DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi).</p>

<p>DNMT inhibitors cause hypomethylation,
removing DNA methylation, of promoters of genes which often are at dinucleotides
often found at CpG islands. </p>

<span>By removing DNA methylation that was created by
the cancer the silenced gene expression can return an so help create new
correct cells and help destroy the cancer cells.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a good point to target
drugs to because, if the methylation of the gene is removed or added it will be
preserved in cell division in to daughter cells the methylation change will
stay intack.</p>

<p><span>Periods of time where extensive epigenetic
reprogramming occurs are sensitive periods. The sensitive periods are  ‘early child development, from fertilized egg
till blastocyst’ and ‘Primordial Germ Cell and Germ Cell development. ’</span></p>

<p><span>So it would be  inadvisable to prescribe these drugs to
pregnant woman, or woman that are trying to get pregnant.  Because that will mean the drug are given in
the sensitive periods and will affect the development of the child.</span></p></div>
