    <div class="field-value"><div>The way cancer impacts DNA is strongly connected to the interaction between methylation and CpG island.<br />CpG islands are clusters of CpG  dinucleotides found mostly at genes promoters regions. The specificity of CpG islands is that they are mostly protected from having methyl groups added  so methylation doesn't normally occur at these regions. There are  some exemptions where methyl groups at CpG islands can be found and this occurrence is automatically associated with gene expression silencing. These are found at particular times  in different cell types during dynamic methylation processes like X inactivation.<br /><br /></div><div>Because it is normal that the CpG islands regions in a normal, stable cell are not accompanied by methyl groups, their occurrence can be a strong suggestion that we are dealing with negative changes and so this is true for cells affected by cancer: CpG islands are very often found in promoters of tumour suppression genes so if CpG island methylation silences expression of theses genes, this will mean that a cell wont be able to activate those genes and thus will lose its defence mechanism against tumour. This is an example of an epigenetic silencing that may be one of the contributors to cancer growth.<br /></div><br /><div>Vast majority of genome does not consist of CpG islands but rather of so called intergenic regions. In these regions you can also find CpG dinucleotides (not entire islands) and in these intervals, the CpGs tend to be methylated in a normal cell. When looking at cancer cells, the CpGs are always hypomethylated (lack methyl groups) at intergenic regions and specifically at repeats. As a result we end up with large regions that are unstable because of they're hypomethylated status leaves them open, and thus susceptible to illegitimate recombinations and transpositions and activation of neighbouring promoters which may disturb transcriptional mechanisms.</div><div><div><br /><br /><br /></div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The expression of an allele of the Igf2 gene<span> depends on its parental origin.<br />When the paternal allele is methylated, the CTCF insulator protein can't bind to the imprinting region, leaving it open to enhancers that promote Igf2's expression.<br /></span>We call it imprinted expression of Igf2. The methylation can now spread to the H19  promoter (at CpG island) to <span>silence it.<br /><br /></span><div>On maternal alleles the imprinted control regions are unmethylated and the H19  RNA is produced. Now the CTCF protein can bind and insulate the Igf2, protecting it from the enhancers so they target the H19 promoter instead, causing it to express. As a result we  have the loss of imprinting and  the imprint control region hypermethylation.<div><br /></div>The loss of imprinting is seen in Wilm's tumour meaning overexpressed growth promoting genes with simultaneous loss of tumour suppressing genes.</div><div><div>The Igf2 remains silent for the maternal  allele (lack of expression), whilst on the methylated paternal allele we see enhanced expression of Igf2.</div><div> <br /></div><div>Loosing imprinting due to hypermethylation  of the imprint control region on the maternal allele mans the expression of Igf2. Unlike in healthy cells we end up with double the amount  of Igf2 which leads to abnormal growth.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div><span></span><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to a class of drugs called DNA-demethylating agents. This means that it works against DNA methyl transferases by inhibiting their action.<br />These drugs act by getting incorporated into DNA itself and by trapping the DNMT proteins by binding them and preventing their release after replication - in the daughter strands. This effect is irreversible and means that the  mechanisms of methyl groups transfers will be inhibited.<br /><br />The successful use of drugs like Decitabine is dependent on cell division and in particular where the hypermethylation of tumour suppressing genes (were growth promoting genes are oevrexpressed) occurs.  As cancer cells divide more rapidly, introducing such  agent will slow down the cellular division and therefore tumour development. This is why demethylating drugs seem to be most effctive in treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The hallmark of epigenetic changes is that they can be passed on via cellular division to next generations of cells. This could mean that even if during therapy with epigenetic drugs, designed to inhibit methylation we don't see the desired results- as in cases with solid tumours, the epigenetic effect, that the drug had on the DNA can be sustained in the form of inhibition of the growth promoting genes. This could slow down the growth of a tumour thus giving the time advantage to the chemotherapeutics. Now they can act on a tumour that's not as resistant and as progressive.</p><p>It is very important to remember that every cancer starts with just one affected cell and a rare event that has downstream consequences. Interfering with epigenetic mechanisms during sensitive periods of development, like in childhood, when germ cells are still developing, could be considered as an insulting environmental hit. It isn't therefore advised to treat young patients with epigenetic drugs that may have an impact on processes crucial for normal cell division. These drugs will affect every cell in the body and we want the growth promoters to be active in the cells of a body that's growing.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p> <br /></p><p><br /></p><p> <br /></p><p><br /></p><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><div><br /></div></div>
