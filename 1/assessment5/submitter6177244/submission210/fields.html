    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at CpG islands is an inactive epigenetic mark,associated with silencing of genes and also involved in X chromosome inactivation. Inheritable property of DNA methylation ensures the genomic stability.<br /> In a cancer cell CpG islands found in promoter regions are more likely to be hypermethylated than in normal cell. <br />The hypermethylation at CpG islands in promoter region resulted in silencing of tumor suppressing genes,controlling of cell cycle,apoptosis and DNA repair mechanisms which resulted in conversion on normal cell into cancer cell,metastasis and immortality of cells.<br />Hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters are associated with activation of potent oncogene R-RAS in gastric cancer and miR21 which results in glioma.<br />The function of DNA methylation at intergenic regions is to maintain genomic integrity.<br /> The function of DNA methylation at repetitive elements is to maintain genomic stability by carrying out silencing of repeats to prevent transposition and transcriptional interference from strong promoters.It may also prevents illegitimate recombination.<br />Intergenic regions and repetitive elements in a cancer cell found to be hypomethylated.In normal cell intergenic regions and repetitive are methylated.<br />Hypomethylation of repetitive elements can cause the illegitimate recombination of chromosomes which shares the genetically similar regions.The repeats can also be activated because of hypomethylation may results into activation of neighboring genes.  <br />Hypomethylation at intergenic regions cause insertion,deletion or reciprocal translocation of chromosomes.<br />In general hypomethylation of repetitive elements/intergenic regions can cause genomic instability and cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">On the paternal allele imprint control region in H19/Igf2 gene is methylated.CTCF can no longer bind and CTCF is not binding and there is no insulator action then the enhancers are free to act on Igf2 and promote Igf2 expresion from paternal allele.<br />On the maternal allele imprint control region in H19/Igf2 unmethylated. So when this imprint control is unmethylated it is bound by insulator protein called CTCF results in inactivation of Igf2 gene expression.<br />In uniparental disomy,you have two paternal like alleles and loss of maternal like allele.That means you get too much Igf2 gene expression which in fact is growth promoting gene and you will get no Cdkn1c expression which is tumor suppressing gene. And that's how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to class DNA methyltransferase inhibitors.<br />They are all nucleoside analogs.So decetabine get incorporated into the DNA upon replication and then, when the DNA methyltransferase 1 comes along to bind that nucleotide to copy the methylation to the daughter strand, that DNMT1 is bound irreversibly by decitabine and it can no longer be released. Because of decitabine after replication DNMT1 will not be able to methylate (addition of methyl group) daughter strands leads to DNA demethylation.<br />The action of decitabine is dependent,it is only active during cell replication.So this means that cancer cells which are dividing much more rapidly than other normal cells will be more severely affected because they are replicating more.<br /> </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a cell if parental strand is unmethylated and by using drugs if we add methyl groups to parental strand then after replication daughter strand will also be methylated. DNMT1 recognizes the hemi-methylated strands and add methyl groups to newly formed strands.So as the cell replicates this methylation mark is conserved in newly formed cells.<br />Sensitive periods are the periods during which epigenetic marks are being established. It means that in this period reprogramming and resetting of epigenetic marks takes place.<br />Epigenetic marks are removed during primordial germ cell development and these marks are also removed after formation of zygote i.e. during pre-implantation development period. After implantation of embryo resetting of epigenetic marks takes place.Epigenetic reprogramming <span> also happens at particular time points for cell differentiation to take place.</span><br />During sensitive periods epigenetic marks can be changed in response to changing diet, environment, drugs etc. So if we treat the patients during sensitive periods it would change the epigenetic marks for example addition of alcohol in diet during pregnancy of mice can cause DNA nethylation. And once the epigenetic marks are established they are maintained maintained because of their mitotically heritable property.Hence the drugs that alter the DNA methylation have the effects beyond the drug treatment.<br /> </div>
