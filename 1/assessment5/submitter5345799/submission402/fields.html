    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are normally hypomethylated. They are often found in promoters of genes, and these genes are thus allowed to be active, rather than inhibited by methylation. In cancer cells, CpG islands are usually hypermethylated. This can contribute to reducing gene expression. If gene expression of tumor supressor genes is reduced due to this hypermethylation, this can contribute to causing cancer. This is similar to having a mutation in a tumor supresssor as one of the "hits" causing a cancer, but here the tumor supressor's DNA sequence may still be unaltered but its expression is reduced due to the methylation. Retinoblastoma and BRCA1 are both examples of tumor supressors shown to be hypermethylated with resulting reduced activity in particular cancers (retinoblastoma and breast cancer respectively). <br /><br />In contrast, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated normally. This functions to reduce the activity of transposable elements, one of the major components of the repetive sequence portion of the genome. In cancer cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated. This can lead to transposable elements becoming more active. This can contribute to causing cancer by having them land in the coding region of a tumor supressor, or by having their promoter land near to a proto-oncogene, activating it. Additionally, hypomethylated repetitive sequences are involved in non-homologous recombination at a higher rate than properly methylated repetitive sequences. This contributes to the increased genomic instability characteristic of cancer cells, translocations in particular.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">On paternal chromosomes there is methylation in the Igf2 ICR, which prevents the insulator CTCF from binding to the DNA. Without this insulator, enhancers downstream from H19 are able to enhance Igf2 transcription. Thus Igf2 is transcriptionally active and expressed on the paternal chromosome.<br /><br />Maternal chromosomes have no methylation of H19, and so the insulator CTCF binds the DNA, and the enhancers downstream from H19 act on H19 instead of on Igf2. Thus Maternal Igf2 is not transcriptionally active (though H19 is).<br /><br />In Wilm's tumor, there is hypermethylation of this region, which effectively converts the maternal chromosome into another paternal one, that is, methylation in this region blocks CTCF allowing the nearby enhancers to act on Igf2, and so maternal Igf2 is transcriptionally active. This means there are two active copies of Igf2 instead of 1. This contributes to cancer because Igf2 is a growth factor, stimulating mitosis and acting here as an oncogene because it now has 200% of normal expression levels.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyl transferase inhibitor (DNMTi). This means it reduces the activity of DNMT enzymes. They are actually base analogs, incorporated into DNA during replication, which are able to bind the DMNT enzymes. This means they can reduce DMNT activity, and thus reduce methylation, though they do so in a replication-dependant manner. This can have an anti-tumor effect because methylation of tumor supressors is an important part of tumorigenisis in many cases. Less active DNMT means less methylation of tumor supressors and thus more normal tumor supressor activity. Also cancer cells are potentially more susceptible to the DNMTi than a normal cell because of their faster rate of replication, analogous to how many traditional chemotherapy agents attack all replicating cells and thus effect cancer cells the most.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. Maintenance methylation enzymes recognize hemi-methylated DNA that results when methylated DNA is replicated, and adds methylation marks to the newly synthesized strand, converting hemi-methylated DNA to methylated DNA. This can continue indefinitely through many generations of mitosis. <br /><br />Sensitive periods are times when epigenetic marks are being laid down, or erased and laid down anew. This includes early embryonic development and primordial germ cell development. Treating patients during sensitive periods with these drugs would be inadvisable, because it could interfere with normal epigenetic programming, of imprinted genes for example. Thus treating pregnant women, and women who may become pregnant while under the effects of these drugs would be inadvisable because it could have harmful effects on the epigenetic state of the growing embryo. </div>
