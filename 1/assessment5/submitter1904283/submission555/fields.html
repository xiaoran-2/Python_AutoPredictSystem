    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is associated with the formation of a repressive chromatin structure in a normal cell.It almost exclusively occurs at CpG dinucleotides.It is the basis for different epigenetic phenomena such as genomic imprinting ,inactivation of the X chromosome and heterochromatin formation.But most of the CpG islands in a normal cell usually remains unmethylated.<br />In cancer ,we observe a lot of epigenetic disruptions that lead to genomic instability including disrupted DNA methylation.CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated in cancer.This change occurs very frequently, almost in every tumour that has been studied.DNA methylation is an alternative to genetic mutation, to silence tumour suppressor genes in cancer.Recognised DNA methylation can be one of the hits in the Knudson hypothesis which states cancer is the result of multiple hits to DNA.<br />Hypermethylation of the CpG's in cancer is, more frequent than mutations.The identity of the CGI's varies by tumour type and as CGI methylation progresses with time, the amount of hypermethylation increases.So methylation profiles and the amount of the methylation genome-wide may help us to identify different kinds of tumours.<br />Repetitive elements are patterns of DNA that occur in multiple copies throughout the genome.They may cut and paste or copy and paste themselves throughout the genome leading to genomic instability, we usually keep them silent in normal cells by methylating them , but in a cancer cell we observe decreased methylation -hypomethylation in repetetive elements, and as a result increased genomic instability by their mutagenic effects.<br />An intergenic region is a stretch of DNA sequences located between genes considered as Noncoding DNA.In healthy cells.In normal cells, they are repressed through methylation to prevent illegitimate combinations and structural anomalies.But in cancer cells they remain hypomethylated that contributes to genomic instability.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a drug that inhibits the function of DNMT enzymes that are responsible for maintenance of the DNA methylation.It is a nucleoside analogue, irreversibly binds DNMT's after they are incorporated into DNA, therefore their function is replication-dependent , it causes demethylation by diluting out the DNA through repetitive divisions.This means cancer cells that are dividing rapidly will be severely affected from decitabine.It is very effective for tumours that are showing hypermethylation predominantly in their methylation profiles because we inhibit DNMT's.Predominant example and major clinical use for Decitabine are some hematological malignancies including MDS-Myelodysplastic Syndromes and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML).Diluting out the hypermethylation from such regions for example tumour suppressor genes, will be resulted with the decrease of the autonomy of tumor cell which is correlated with good prognosis, preferable course of the disease.Of course, this is the total effect of the drug, the effect of the drug might change with the type of the tumor.<i></i></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Genomic imprinting is the epigenetic phenomenon by which certain genes are expressed in a parent-of-origin-specific manner.<span><br />Imprinting of the H19/Igf2 cluster chromosome 11 occurs normally by the mechanism of enhancer blocking.H19 gene's Imprint Control Region(ICR) is methylated in paternal allele that blocks an insulator protein called CTCF from binding its ICR and allows enhancers to act on Igf2 ,and Igf2 is being expressed from paternal allele.In maternal allele CTCF binds to the ICR and it blocks maternal transcription of Igf2 by insulating the gene from enhancers,so enhancers work on H19 and it is expressed by maternal allele.<br />In the case of Wilm's tumor ,a kidney tumor mostly seen in children ,caused by maternal allele behaving like the paternal due to various abnormalities such as mutations in DNA, uniparental disomy or epigenetic disruptions.Since both alleles act like the paternal there is overdose of the Igf2 which is an oncogene,a growth promoting gene ,that causes cell autonomy any uncontrolled cell division which are the properties of the cancer cells.Oncogene activation is one of the hallmark events in cancer.<br />Loss of imprinting in H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer by loss of expression of growth restricting genes and overexpression of growth promoting genes (Igf2).</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation and possibly other epigenetic phenomenas might cause some unwanted outcomes for future generations and even for the individual who takes an epigenetic drug for a malignant disease.There are two epigenetically sensitive periods throughout development when epigenetic reprogramming occur ;primordial germ cell development and early embryonic development.During these periods, epigenetic marks throughout the genome ,in general ,has been cleared and resetted.So the genome and the epigenome is susceptible for possible mistakes and disruptions if we alter with this process.<br />Treating patients with epigenetic drugs during one of these sensitive periods, for example , during premordial germ cell development ,will effect future generations with possible disruptions epigenetically , this may cause developmental disorders ,infertility , imprinting disorders ,even mutations in the genome due to instability ,so we must not advice to treat patients who are younger ,possibly at child-bearing age to be treated with epigenetic drugs.Also with the early embryonic phase ,we must not advise pregnant woman to use these medications during early pregnancy in order to not altering with epigenetic reprogramming.But with the elder patients ,we are more comfortable to use these medications in their favour ,because these medications increase the survival ,and they are not as epigenetically sensitive.</div>
