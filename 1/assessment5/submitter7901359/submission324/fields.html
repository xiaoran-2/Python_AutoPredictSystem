    <div class="field-value">The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is the regulation of gene expression. CpG islands influence local chromatin structure and is involved in the regulation of gene activity. Silencing of CpG island promoters is achieved through dense CpG methylation or polycomb recruitment.
In normal cells CpG islands are hypomethylated at gene promoters, destabilizing nucleosomes and attracting proteins that create a transcriptionally permissive chromatin state. However at the intergenic regions and repetitive elements, the CpG islands are hypermethylated contributing to their silencing. 
In cancer cells is just the opposite, CpG islands are hypermthylated at promoters and hypomethylated at intergenic region and repetitive elements.  As a consequence, in cancer cells the expression of some essential genes that regulates the cell growth, like tumour suppressor genes may be silenced. Therefore cells can be divided without control originating tumours.  On the other hand hypomethylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements allow the expression of transposable elements contributing to genomic instability causing mutations, DNA rearrangements with deletions, insertions and translocations. All these, might also affect to genes that control direct or indirectly the cell growth and therefore contributing to the disease.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">H19 codes for a long noncoding RNA that has a role in the regulation of cell proliferation and body weight. H19 is only transcribed from the maternally inherited allele.
Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2) is one of three protein hormones that share structural similarity to insulin. It is believed to be a major fetal growth factor. IGF-2 is only transcribed from the paternally inherited allele.
In cells the imprinting control region (ICR) of the H19/Igf2 locus is only methylated in the paternal allele. 
The CTCF complex, that forms an unusual DNA structure through the zinc finger domain of the protein, binds to the ICR of the maternal allele allowing downstream enhancers of H19 activated his transcription.
The CTCF complex cannot bind the ICR of the paternal allele because is methylated, which silence the H19 gene, but instead the enhancers activate the expression of Igf2.
In Wilm’s tumour both H19/Igf2 locus alleles are methylated at the ICR. One of the reasons could be that both came from the father. In these circumstances there is not expression of H19 and an overexpression of IGF-2. This may cause a dysregulation of cell growth and cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a type of DNA-demethylating agent, specifically a class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. It therefore contributes to the hypomethylation of DNA.
Decitabine is indicated for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.
The anti-tumour effect of Decitabine has been attributed to its hypomethylating activity that triggers the expression of tumour suppressor genes that were silenced epigenetically by hipermethylation.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">A combination of a histone-deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine (DNA methyltransferase inhibitor and cytotoxic), slowed the rate of tumour growth in people with advanced lung cancer. The reason is that the  epigenetic changes induced by these drugs may pass to daughter and granddaughter cells.
Treatments with drugs modifying the epigenetic marks may be quite risky during sensitive periods where general epigenetic changes occur. These sensitive periods are during pregnancy, since there are a lot of epigenetic programming in early child development. Also it might be important throughout the formation of gametes, both ovules and sperm.</div>
