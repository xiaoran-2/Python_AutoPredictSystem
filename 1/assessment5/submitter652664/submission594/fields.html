    <h1>Submission 594 from Anon (session_user_id: e254dae7f938206ebd41872174cdf6fbd3395286)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a type of
drug known as DNA methyltransferase
inhibitor. Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue, it
is incorporated in to DNA and binds irreversibly to DMNTs when DMNT tries to
copy methylation to the daughter DNA strand of hemi-methylated DNA. This
prevents the DNMT molecule from further methylation. </p>

<p>The DNA of tumors show hypermethylation of CpG islands, home to many tumor suppressor genes. What
Decitabine does is to “reactivate” these tumor suppressor genes. Decitabine is replication dependent; its effects increase with replication as more daughter strands are affected by Decitabine. Because
tumor cells replicate so quickly, DNA is copied many times. This means an increase in Decitabine effect leading to more demethylation. This leads to an increased chance that tumor suppressor genes are unmethylated in newer strands of DNA within the same tumor cell or in newer tumor daughter
cells and an overall anti-tumor effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The difference in methylation between normal cells and
cancer cells include the hypermethylation of CpG islands and CpG island shores and
the hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements in cancer. </p>

<p> The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is
to silence the promoters of genes, leading to downregulation or complete
silencing of gene or genes affected by the promoter. In the case of cancer, DNA
methylation is increased at CpG islands and at neighboring bases known as CpG island shores. This contributes to cancer as tumor
suppressor genes are silenced.</p>

<p> The normal function of DNA methylation at intergenic
regions and repetitive elements is to maintain genomic stability. In cancer,
DNA methylation is decreased at intergenic regions and repetitive elements. This
causes genomic instability in that illegitimate combinations of repeats are
created and repeats and transposons are activated. The activation of repeats
and transposons causes the jumping of those transposon into genes and
disrupting them or causes the jump out of position and activation of cryptic
promoters. A combination of the disruption of genes and the activation of
cryptic promoters, which may activate oncogenes, is an outcome of genomic
instability and found in cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer, disruption of
imprinting causes cancer in that alterations
in DNA methylation (either hypermethylation or hypomethylation) at ICRs can result in loss of expression of growth-restricting
genes or overexpression of growth-promoting genes.</p>

<p>For H19/Igf2
cluster, there is a difference between the alleles of the ICR inherited by
parents. The maternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster has an unmethylated ICR. This
lack of methylation of the ICR allows CTCF to bind to it. The binding of CTCF insulates
against action on the Igf2 gene and forces enhancers to act upon H19, causing
expression of H19. In the paternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster, there is methylation of the ICR, meaning CTCF cannot bind onto the ICR. The lack of
binding of CTCF means enhancers can act upon Igf2, giving rise to
expression of Igf2. </p>

<p>For H19/Igf2, hypermethylation disrupts imprinting by methylating
the maternal ICR. Because the maternal allele is now methylated, the maternal
allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster blocks the binding of CTCF. This
hypermethylation causes the maternal allele to be similar to paternal
allele, both now causing Igf2 expression. This leads to a double dose of
Igf2, a growth promoter, and leads to increased growth associated with Wilm’s Tumor. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The effects of altering DNA methylation can be
seen in metastable epialleles, epigenetic states established in early development and heritable for the organism's lifetime.
In mice, the Agouti promoter being unmethylated leads to constitutive expression
of the Agouti gene and correlation with obesity and diabetes. </p>

<p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation can affect
beyond the period of treatment, particularly in periods known as sensitive
periods. These sensitive periods are times that epigenetic marks
are cleared and reset. They are pre-implantation to early
post-implantation and primordial germ cell development to mature gamete
production. The effect of methylation on sensitive periods in Agouti mice
models show that methyl donors consumed by a mother during early development or preconception (PGC development) can epigenetically alter the outcome of the offspring. In the case
of feeding folate to a wild-type pregnant mother bred with a male Agouti
yellow mouse, it led to more pseudo-Agouti offspring and less Agouti
offspring.</p>

<p>It is inadvisable to treat patients with DNA
methylation drugs during sensitive periods of pre-implantation to
post-implantation, conception to placental implantation, in pregnant females
and during primordial germ cell development, beginning to end of puberty, in
both genders. It could lead to inheritance of transgenerational
epigenetic effects. </p></div>
