    <h1>Submission 333 from Anon (session_user_id: 545cc0c7f5cf3a147b06b5bb3f87a3b6d38e2b77)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a member of one of the classes of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. Hence, it contributes to the hypomethylation of DNA. Decitabine is being used to treat myelodysplatic syndrome - a specific condition in which the bone marrow produces deformed blood cells, a precursor of acute myelogenous leukemia. With respect to Decitabine, the anti­tumour effect is linked with reactivation of epigenetically silenced tumor supressor genes, and this is induced by the hypothemylation.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell, the CpG islands are hypomethylated, whereas the intergeneic regions, viz., the introns and repetitive elements are hypermethylated. In a cancer cell, a reverse pattern is observed normally, viz., CpG islands are more likely to be hypermethylated, and the intergeneic regions are hypomethylated. Therefore, for the CpG islands, this disruption leads to problems. This might cause silencing of tumor suppressor genes in the cell. Following this, the cell divides more rapidly, out-competing neighboring cells, and thus growing into a tumour. For the intergenic regions and repetitive elements, normal hypermethylation at these sites is associated with greater genomic stability. Whereas, hypomethylation at these sites can be associated with cancerous growth. And this leads to copying errors such as deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations in the chromosomes.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a cell around the H19/Igf2 cluster, we see the methylation of the paternal allele at the ICR. Due to the methyl marks, the CTCF complex does not bind to the paternal allele , which leads to silencing of the H19 gene as the enhancers drive expression of Igf2. Whereas, for the maternal allele we do not see any methylation. The CTCF complex binds to the allele on the maternal strand resulting in the downstream enhancers to act on H19.  Thus, in a normal cell, a normal dose of both Igf2 from paternal strand, and H19 from maternal strand can be found. However, in case of Wilm's tumour, disruption occurs - and this ICR becomes hypermethylated. Under such a situation, both strands appear to be of paternal origin and get expressed as such. That is, the cell gets a double dose of Igf2 and no dose of H19. Igf2 being growth promoting, a double dose of it leads to cancer.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation will have enduring effects on the epigenome as the DNA methyltransferase enzymes preserve methyl marks during mitosis. These are global interventions and may interfere with ordinary functioning of the system, especially during critical periods. Critical periods are those periods of time where extensive epigenetic reprogramming occurs. Specifically,  during pregnancy - as<br />a lot of epigenetic reprogramming happens in early child development period as well as during the formation of gametes - both male and female. Thus, it would not be advisable to prescribe these treatments during critical periods.<br /><br /><br /></div>
