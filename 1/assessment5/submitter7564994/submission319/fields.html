    <div class="field-value"> DNA methylation is one
of the most important functional alterations that accurse in epigenetics. In
general where DNA methylation is found transcription factors of the cell cannot
bind due to the methyl groups that block this connection.  Therefor it is
vital for this phenomenon to take place in  specific chromosomal departments meaning that
any differention from normal may lead to a tone of epigenetic problems such as
cancer. 

<p>DNA methylation is
typically found on and closely around the CpG island clusters some hundreds
base pairs upstream of almost every gene. Its normal function is to control
gene expression. Essentially when CpG islands are extensively methylated this
usually leads to the genes under expression or even the specific genes
silencing. <span><br />
Cancer is situation where a lot of genetic and
epigenetic abnormalities are present. Overall CpG islands tend to be over
methylated in cancer leading to silencing of genes, especially those genes that
lead to cell death signaling however in the case of oncogenes (genes that
promote cell growth) CpG islands are demethylated leading to cell proliferation
and high cell division rate. In this manner we can assume that in cancer most
oncogenes are upregulated contributing to the cells indefinite survival in
contrast to genes that control the cells apoptosis path where CpG islands
methylation is abundantly present.</span></p>

<p><span><br /><span>As for the repetitive elements and the
intergenic regions these are positions that are normally found methylated in
the genome. This is logical for these regions are found throughout the genes
and must be methylated to not allow elements to bind in the middle of genes
disrupting its transcriptional control. In an opposite manner of CpG islands, these
regions are methylated in the normal genome but unmethylated in cancer so as to
disrupt the cells stability by allowing recombination’s and silencing where not
needed.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>ICR methylation is
another important aspect in epigenetics. In the case of imprinted genes there
is a pattern that determines which allele will be expressed for the specific
gene. (The paternal or maternal) In the case of the H19/Igf2 cluster it is
predetermined by methylation patterns on the ICR region of the paternal allele
that the H19 gene must be transcribed by the maternally derived chromosome in
contrast to the Igf2 gene that must be transcribed by the paternal allele
solely. This happens because when the ICR region is methylated CTCF complex
cannot be recruited leading to the silencing of the H19 gene but expression of
Igf2. When this pattern is disrupted by methylation on both ICRs we have 100%
silencing of the H19 gene and double expression of the Igf2 gene since both
patterns are now similar and paternal like. This leads to over expression of
Igf2 a growth promoting gene that will eventually turn the normal cell to a
cancer cell. This is a commonly found as an early event and is described as Wilm’s
tumor.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug
that is on the market and is used to treat cancer through altering the
epigenetic state in the patient’s cells. Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating
agent witch is sold as Dacogen by Eisai, a Japanese company and is used to
treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous
leukaemia.This agents antitumor effect is accomplished through demethylating
methylated apartments in the genome that suppress tumor growth and are
abnormally methylated so as to prolong the cells lifespan. This demethylation proses
can lead to expression of cell death signals that will eventually lead to
natural cell apoptosis and further tumor anti-growth and thus<span> stop the uncontrolled cell growth
that causes cancer.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Altering DNA
methylation patterns may lead to differentiation of the chromosomal
architecture, recombination and also silencing of vital to the cells survival
genes. Epigenetic changes that happen during chemotherapy with a drug that
alters the epigenetic state are passed on during cell division to daughter and
granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they
do not return. This is how these drugs tend to survive beyond the period of
treatment. When assuming an epigenetic drug it is vital to be very careful of
the exact timing of the treatment so as to avoid any sensitive epigenetic
periods. The most important period of life which has the biggest impact on the
epigenome is that of primordial gem cell development. Therefor it is highly
inadvisable to treat a pregnant woman with such a drug in this period for not only
will the effect of the drug affect the patient but it will also have
devastating effects on her carrying child and her grandchildren for
 during primordial germ cell development we can find the highest rate of
epigenetic reprograming. In addition the preimplantation period is also a
sensitive state when epigenetic drug treatment is inadvisable.</span></div>
