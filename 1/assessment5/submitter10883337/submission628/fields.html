    <div class="field-value">   A so much common epigenetic event that occurs in cancer cells is the hypermethylation of specific CpG islands. CpG islands are normally found unmethylated, but tumour supressor genes (TSG) can be epigenetically silenced because the CpG islands which are methylated in cancer are frequently found in TSG promoters. If this silencing occurs, each cancer cell will inherit this feature, since methylations is mitotically heritable. Cells with this epimutation have advantages that allow them to keep dividing and growing up. It's important to say that epimutations are reversible, so there is the possibility to remove them and try to defeat cancer. Each CpG island wich is hypermethylated can be associated with a particular feature of the cancer, as weel as the capacity to do metastasis, for example. <br />   Another epigenetic event we frequently find in cancer cells' DNA is hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements that are methylated in normal cells. This progressive hypomethylation leads to reduction of the genomic stability sustained by the methylation of this regions, so the happening of deletion, insertion and translocation is favored. This situation also leads to activation of repeats, which have the capacity to make copies of themselves and jump around the genome, disrupting the DNA sequence. At last, the hypomethylation of the genome can lead to activation of promotors that lead to transcriptional aberrations. Hyper and hypomethylation are just a little bit of so much things that can occur epigenetically in cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">   The imprinted control region (ICR) of the Igf2H19 cluster is generally found unmethylated in the maternal allele and methylated in the paternal allele. This way, what happens in the maternal allele is that CTCF binds the ICR allowing the enhancers act on H19 rather than on Igf2, and so Igf2 becomes silenced. In contrast, on the paternal allele CTCF can't' inhibit the Igf2 expression because the ICR is methylated and CTCF can't bind it. Therefore, Igf2 is a monoallelic expression gene and a imprinted gene, since is expressed just on paternal allele. <br />   If the Igf2H19 ICR found on the maternal allele is hypermethylated, Igf2 will be expressed, then there will be a double dose of Igf2, wich is a gene associated with growth promoting. So, this cell has now a hyperexpressed oncogene, that is associated with a cancer type called Wilm's tumour.<br />   We need to remember that ICRs can be found hyper or hypomethylated in cancer, depending on their status in normal cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a drug that belongs to the class of the DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitors (DNMTi) and is used to treat haematological cancer, like myelodysplastic syndromes. Decitabine's mechanism is still unclear, but it reduces the DNA methylation. We know that DNA methylation is associated with silencing of tumour supressor genes and activating of oncogenes through epigenetic mechanisms (hypermethylation of CpG islands, for example), so Decitabine's use can defeat cancer or make it grow  more slowly.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that alter DNA epigenetically represents a very nice strategy to fight against cancer, because epigenetic hallmarks are mitotically heritable, i.e., all the cells originated from a treated cell will have the same epigenetic features, keeping this effect along the time. However, DNA has sensitive periods, like the early development and the primordial germ cells development, i.e., periods of reduction of the epigenetic marks, and is inadvisable use epigenetic drugs at this moments, because this practice can lead abnormal epigenetic marks development.</div>
