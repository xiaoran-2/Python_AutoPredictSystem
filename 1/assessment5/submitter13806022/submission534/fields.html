    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>CpG island
do not tend to be metilated, in general the CpG island is protected from
methylation. In cancer cells the same CpG island can be hypermetilated, and
silencing gene expression.  The CpG
island hypermethylation is very important in cancer and have a poor prognostic
outcome for myelodysplastic syndrome.</span></p>

<p><span>In
intergenic regions and repetitive elements, the DNA is methylated. It is
importante to protect the DNA from mutations, but in cancer cells  demethylation can occurs in this regions, and
this can contribute to cancer because we can have a lot of mutation, mainly
with some repetitive elements that can change to another place in genome.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>H19/Igf2 is
a linked cluster of imprinted genes, where we have the imprinted control region
in the middle ,which is controlled by an enhance blocking.  On maternal allele the imprint control region
is unmethylated, but is methylated on paternal allele (paternal imprinting). </span></p>

<p><span>The
maternal imprint control region unmethylated is bound by a insulator protein
called CTCF, it allows to the enhance act on H19,  but prevents Igf2 is produced on maternal
allele, it is happen because of chromatin looping.</span></p>

<p><span>In paternal
allele, the imprint control region is methylated, CTCF can not bind, so the
enhancer is free to act on Igf2 and it is produced on paternal allele. So we
have Igf2 only being produced on paternal allele. But if the imprint control
region on maternal allele is hypermethylated 
we have Igf2 being produced much more and it is growth promoting, so is
a oncogene. It is happen on Wilm’s tumour.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine
is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor drug. It is not specific for tumor cells
and act in all cells, but it is division dependent so act more in cancer cells
because divide much more rapidly than most other cells.</p>

<p><span>The drug
gets incorporated into the DNA upon replication, so DNA methyltransferase bind irreversibly
and copy the methylation to the daughter strand. It is important on DNA
demethylation we can see in cancer cells,in CPG island for example.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetics
alterations are deeply involved in cancer cells. DNA methylation or
demethylation can be passed through cells proliferation,. If it happen
alteration on DNA methylation this is passed to daughter cells. Some drugs acts
on epigenetics alterations we have seen in cancer cells. These drugs alter some
of epigenetics alterations to reverse them.</p>

<p><span>But this
drugs can not be used in sensitive period, when the epigenetics marks are
removed and any change in epigenetic marks can be dangerous.  The sensitive periods are pre implantation and
generation of the sperm and the eggs.</span></p></div>
