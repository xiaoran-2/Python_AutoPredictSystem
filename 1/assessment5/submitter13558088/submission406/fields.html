    <div class="field-value"><p><span>-      
</span>CpG islands or
CG islands (CGIs) are short stretch of DNA in which the frequency of the CG
sequence is higher than other regions. CpG
islands have been shown to co-localise with the promoters. In normal cells, CpG
islands preceding gene promoters are generally unmethylated, allowing gene
transcription while other individual CpG dinucleotides throughout the genome tend
to be methylated. Normally, when a CpG island in the promoter region of a gene
is methylated, expression of the gene is repressed (it is turned off).</p>

<p><span>-      
</span>Disruption of DNA
methylation is a typical hallmark of cancer. The "normal" CpG
methylation profile is often inverted in cells that become tumorigenic. Cancer
cells show genome-wide (global) hypomethylation and site-specific CpG island
promoter hypermethylation. Indeed, CpG islands may be strongly methylated. As a
result, transcription of many genes gets blocked, and aberrant transcription
may occur from incorrect transcription start sites. </p>

<p><span>-      
</span>In malignant
cells, CpG islands preceding tumor suppressor gene promoters are often
hypermethylated, while CpG methylation of oncogene promoter regions and
parasitic repeat sequences is often decreased. This contributes to cancer. </p>

<p><span>-      
</span>In normal cells,
DNA methylation in intergenic region and repetitive sequences prevents genomic
instability and, again, spurious transcription initiations. The CpG poor
regions found in repetitive elements within the intergenic and intronic regions
of the genome are methylated and thereby maintain a closed chromatin structure.</p>

<p><span>-      
</span><span>Cancer cells
exhibit hypomethylation of intergenic regions that normally comprise the
majority of a cell’s methyl-cytosine content. Consequently, transposable
elements may become active and contribute to the genomic instability and gene
disruption observed in cancer cells</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>- On the paternal allele, methylation
of the imprint control region (ICR) represses the H19 expression and prevents
the attachment of the CTCF protein and the enhancers can activate Igf2
promoters, thereby triggering the Igf2 genes.</p><p>- The ICR on the maternal
chromosome is unmethylated, which enables the zinc-finger protein CTCF to bind
to the ICR. CTCF has a chromatin insulator function as it prevents the action
of enhancers on the promoter of IGF2. However, the enhancers can interact with
the H19 promoter, and H19 is active. Thus, H19 is expressed from the maternal
allele and IGF2 from the paternal allele. </p><p><span>- Aberrant imprinting of the
IGF2 gene plays a role in Wilms tumour. The
maternal chromosome reverses to a paternal epigenotype, with a paternal pattern
of methylation of the H19 promoter, IGF2 turned on, and H19 turned off. </span></p><p>
























</p><p><span>- The expression pattern
becomes paternal for both alleles with an increase expression in IGF2 peptide,
causing over proliferation. The down regulation of H19 may also account. Indeed
the overexpression of H19 RNA in nephroblastoma cell line was found to arrest
its growth. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>- Decitabine belongs to the
category of chemotherapy called antimetabolites. Decitabine is also classified
as a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. It is a deoxyribonucleoside (cytidine
analog).  </p>

<p> </p>

<p>- During DNA replication,
DNMT1, the most abundant DNA methyltransferases binds to and methylates the
cytosines CpG dinucleotides of the daughter strand of newly replicated DNA
thereby preserving the parental methylation pattern When incorporated into
newly synthesized DNA, decitabine works by demethylation or interfering with
the methylation of DNA by covalently link DNMT1 to DNA, effectively preventing
DNMT1 from methylating DNA, causing DNA hypomethylation. </p>

<p> </p>

<p><span>- Cancer cells are replicating
more that normal cells in the body and therefore are more affected. The levels
of DNMT are often increased in various cancer tissues and cell lines, which may
partially account for the hypermethylation of promoter CpG-rich regions of
tumor suppressor genes in a variety of malignancies.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic drugs affect the
epigenome by acting on the chemical changes regulating gene expression. Indeed,
those drugs affect how cells read genes instead of being caused by changes in
the DNA. Methylation of DNA is a common epigenetic signaling tool that cells
use to lock genes in the "off" position. Epigenetic changes are
passed on during cell division until they are actively erased. When erased they
do not return. </p>

<p><span>- A sensitive period is a
period in which environmental signals affect the structure and function of the
genome. These epigenetic processes seem to be ideal mechanisms for how early
life environments may influence life-long health.  Epigenetic changes that happen during
sensitive period could be passed down from parent to child, one generation
after the next (‘transgenerational epigenetic inheritance’)</span></p>

<p><span>- Early life is an especially
sensitive period of development, DNA-methylation influences the pattern of
several genes, and therefore affects our epigenome. As DNA methylation patterns
represent stable epigenetic modifications that alter gene transcription
throughout the lifespan and promote specific behavioral outcomes, it is
preferable to avoid treating young patients with epigenetic drugs. </span></p></div>
