    <h1>Submission 119 from Anon (session_user_id: 5f5588da64b0962984896e50b2cb2993b4e6c0dd)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells CpG islands are hypomethylated to increase the stability of the genome due to silencing of genes, whereas in cancer cells CpG islands are more likely to be methylated.</p><p>CGI hypermethylation leads to the silencing of tumour suppressors, as CpG islands are found in promoters of tumour suppressor genes. This methylation can be inherited through mitosis, giving the daughter cells a competitive advantage over the surrounding cells leading to tumour formation.</p><p>In normal cells the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated to maintain stability of the genome. This prevents the repetitive elements from transposing elsewhere in the genome as well as preventing illegitimate chromosome recombination.</p><p>In cancer cells the intergenic regions and repetitive elements become hypomethylated so they are no longer suppressed. Hypomethylation can lead to illegitimate recombination. This results when regions of the repetitive elements of chromosomes match up (where the 2 chromosomes would not normally match up) due to lack of methylation and lack of heterochromatin structure. This allows the two chromosomes to crossover where they should not be able to.</p><p>Transposons can cause cancer by disrupting tumour suppressor genes if they insert themselves in it thereby silencing it. Illegitimate crossover could result in gene deletion and if this was the deletion  of a tumour suppressor then the cell could become cancerous.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The paternal ICR is methylated and CTCF will not bind the insulator. this allow enhacers to act on Igf2 which leads to their expression</p><p>The maternal ICR is unmethylated so CTCF will bind the insulator. This means the enhancers act on H19 and Igf2 remains silent</p><p>Wilm's tumour is due to hypermethyation of the maternal ICR leading to its silencing. Both alleles act like the paternal allele, resulting in a double dose of Igf2.</p><p>The double dose of Igf2 (which is a growth promoting factor) means that the cell grows more rapidly than the surround cells which gives it a competitive advantage. This allows it to outcompete the surround tissue and form a tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNMTi drug (DNA methyltransferase inhibitor)</p><p>Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue so becomes incorporated into the DNA when replication occurs. When DNMT arrives to add a methyl group to the DNA, it is bound irreversibly to the DNA. </p><p>At low drug doses this results in DNA demethylation as the tumour suppressor methylation cannot be maintained and the cell consequently dies. DNMT is active during cell division so the drug only works on dividing cells so is therefore more toxic to cancer cells because they are actively dividing. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable so will be present after cell division. This is due to DNMT1 which is able to recognise hemi-methylated DNA and restore the methylation pattern to the other strand post cell division.</p><p>A sensitive period is a time period there the genome is cleared of epigenetic marks so environmental condtions would have a greater effect on the epigenetic mechanisms.</p><p>Sensitive periods are during primordial germ cell development up to mature gamete production and the pre-implantation to post implantation period. </p><p>Treating patients during these periods could have long term consequences because multiple generations could be affected. This is because the treatment could affect the germ cells during sensitive periods where their DNA is being cleared of epigenetic marks and then being reset. If these germ cells are altered during this period then the gametes will be irreversibly altered as well.</p></div>
