    <div class="field-value">In normal cells, the observed epigenetic state consists of  CpG islands hypomethylation and genome-wide hypermethylation. In cancer cells is observed the opposite: - CpG island hypermethylation and genome-wide hypomethylation.<br />The CpG island methylation is related to the silencing of gene expression. In cancer cells is observed CpG island hypermethylation  upstream of tumor supressor genes, resulting in uncontrolled cell division.<br />Also in normal cells, the DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements ensure genomic stability, however, in cancer cells, hypomethylation is observed in these regions causing genomic instability due to illegitimate recombination between repeats, transpositions (known by play  a mutagenic role) and cryptic promoter activation.<br /><br />___<br />References: Week 7 - video lectures.<br />-<span>Translated from Portuguese with the help of Google <span>translator.</span></span><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The loss of imprinting that results in activation of an oncogene or causes growth promoter be overexpressed may result in cancer.<br />Taking as an example the H19/Igf2 cluster, we have an imprinting mechanism that works through enhancer blocking. The H19/Igf2 cluster is located in chromosome 11 and undergoes paternal imprinting.<br /><br />In cluster H19/Igf2:<br />-The Igf2 gene is upstream of ICR, H19 and enhancers;<br />-The enhancers has more affinity with the Igf2 promoter.<br /><br />Under normal conditions, the ICR, on the maternal allele is not methylated, allowing the CTCF binds to DNA and insulates Igf2 from enhancers.<br />In the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated and the methylation spreads until the H19's promoter, allowing the enhancers to access Igf2.<br /><br />When the ICR, in maternal allele is hypermethylated, occurs the loss of imprinting, CTCF can not binds to DNA and the enhancers access the Igf2. Igf2 is an oncogene, yours overexpression may results in Wilm's tumor.<br /><br />___<br />References: Week 4 and Week 7 - video lectures.<br />-<span>Translated from Portuguese with the help of Google translator.</span><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The Decitabine acts in cancer treatment as a hypomethylating agent. Decitabine is an epigenetic inhibitor analogous to cytosine nucleoside and reduces the DNA Methyltransferase activity and, consequently, DNA Methylation is decreased.<br />Decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) is incorporated to DNA, when the DNMT binds to  5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine becomes inactive and is degraded.<br />Aberrant DNA methylation causes cancer by silence genes that acts as tumor supressors, the decitanibe has a anti-tumour effect by reducing the abnormal DNA methylation.<br />__<br />References:<br />The Economist (2015-08-14) – Cancer's epicentre.<br /><br />Wikipedia (2015-08-14) - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decitabine">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decitabine</a><br /><br />J Clin Oncol. 2011 Feb 10; 29(5): 516–523 - Hypomethylating Agents and Other Novel Strategies in Myelodysplastic Syndromes.<br /><br />Int.

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that alter the DNA methylation may have effects after the treatment, because a hypomethylating agent (for sample) reduces the DNA methylation and this resultant epigenetic state of cells will be mitotically inherited by daughter cells, thus, the DNA methylation will be progressively diluted by the subsequents divisions.<br />Sensitive periods are those that occurs establishment of epigenetic marks  as the PGC maturation, cellular differentiation and gametogenesis.<br />The treatment with hypomethylating agents it would not recommended on the early development when is in pre-implantation period, because it is the period where genomic regions as the IAPs are kept methylated. The same occurs on gametogenesis when epigenetic marks are established.<br />When the cells are differentiating and acquiring your identity also is a sensitive period, because when the cell is differentiated your epigenetic state will be established, the subsequent cell divisions inherit the epigenetic state of parent cells, hypomethylating agents can disrupt this epigenetic state and activate oncogenes, transposons and cryptic promoters.<br /><br />__<br />References:<br />The economist (15/08/2015)- Cancer’s epicentre<br />Biochimie 94 (2012) 2219e2230 - Epigenomics of cancer e emerging new concepts<br /><br />Week 4 an 5 lectures.<br /><br />-Translated from Portuguese with the help of Google translator.<br /></div>
