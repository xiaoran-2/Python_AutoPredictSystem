    <div class="field-value"><p>Altered methylation patterns are known to occur in the DNA of cancer cells. Two patterns have been observed: wide areas of global hypomethylation along the genome, and localized areas of hypermethylation at certain specific sites, the CpG islands, within the gene promoter regions.</p><p>Based on these patterns, several theories have emerged to implicate DNA methylation mechanisms in carcinogenesis. In fundamental genetic models of cancer, the amplification of protooncogenes, or the silencing of tumor suppressor genes, disrupts the balance that normally controls cell proliferation and drives it through the succession of events leading to full malignant status. Thus, in theory, decreased methylation, and hence relief of transcriptional silencing, may allow the expression of previously quiescent protooncogenes to become active and induce the cell proliferation events. Alternatively, increased methylation at previously unmethylated sites, such as the promoter regions of a tumor suppressor gene, may result in their silencing through inhibition of transcription and their inability to suppress cell proliferation.</p><p>Abnormal methylation patterns can also indirectly affect gene activity with the disruption of the transcription–translation process by increasing the probability for a mutational event to take place and reducing overall chromosomal stability, resulting in the manufacture of a dysfunctional protein product. Methylated cytosine has a greater propensity to undergo spontaneous deamination and the formation of thymine. If this does occurs on a tumor suppressor gene, then a point mutation develops and loss of control of cell proliferation can occur.</p><p><strong>References</strong></p><div><div>1. <span>Hanahan D, Weinberg RA.

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>

    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;

    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;

    <div class="field-value">The <i>H19/IGFf2</i><span> locus belongs to a large imprinted domain located on human chromosome 11p15.5 (homologue to mouse distal chromosome 7). The </span><i>H19</i><span> gene is expressed from the maternal allele, while </span><i>IGF2</i><span> is paternally expressed. Natural antisense transcripts and intergenic transcription have been involved in many aspects of eukaryotic gene expression, including genomic imprinting and RNA interference. However, apart from the identification of some </span><i>IGF2</i><span> antisense transcripts, few data are available on that topic at the </span><i>H19/IGF2</i><span> locus. We identify here a novel transcriptional activity at both the human and the mouse </span><i>H19/IGF2</i><span>imprinted loci. This activity occurs antisense to the </span><i>H19</i><span> gene and has the potential to produce a single 120-kb transcript that we called the </span><i>91H</i><span> RNA. This nuclear and short-lived RNA is not imprinted in mouse but is expressed predominantly from the maternal allele in both mice and humans within the </span><i>H19</i><span> gene region. Moreover, the transcript is stabilized in breast cancer cells and overexpressed in human breast tumors.

    <div class="field-value"><b>Drugs' effects on Epigenetics</b><br />It's now understood that widely-consumed drugs affect epigenetic processes to potentially induce adverse drug reactions. One example is valproic acid - a component of Depakote, a drug used to treat conditions ranging from depression to epilepsy, even autism. It was recently established that the compound is a direct inhibitor of histone deacetylease - an enzyme crucial to epigenetic regulation of the genome. As a result of increased histone acetylation induced by valproic acid, changes in genomic DNA methylation were observed as well.<br />Some specific examples of side-effects with likely epigenetic substrates are listed below<br /><br /><b>SSRIs:</b> altered chromatin structure, gene expression<br /><b>Methylphenidate:</b> altered gene expression, synaptic plasticity<br /><b>ß-Blockers:</b> hyperglycemia, diabetes, insomnia, depression<br /><b>COX-2 Inhibitors (NSAIDs): </b>increased cardiovascular mortality risk<br /><b>Valproic Acid: </b>inhibits histone deacetylase, altered gene expression, skeletal malformation<br /><b>Contraceptives:</b> cancer, osteoporosis, sexual dysfunction<br /><b>                                           Citation:<br /></b><a href="https://drugs-forum.com/forum/local_links.php?action=jump&amp;catid=69&amp;id=11174" title="Link: https://drugs-forum.com/forum/local_links.php?action=jump&amp;catid=69&amp;id=11174">Wang et al.

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:

    <div class="field-value"><span>DNA methylation is an important regulator of gene transcription, and its role in carcinogenesis has been a topic of considerable interest in the last few years. Alterations in DNA methylation are common in a variety of tumors as well as in development. Of all epigenetic modifications, hypermethylation, which represses transcription of the promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes leading to gene silencing, has been most extensively studied. However, global hypomethylation has also been recognized as a cause of oncogenesis. New information concerning the mechanism of methylation and its control has led to the discovery of many regulatory proteins and enzymes. The contribution of dietary folate and methylene terahydrofolate reductase polymorphisms to methylation patterns in normal and cancer tissues is under intense investigation. As methylation occurs early and can be detected in body fluids, it may be of potential use in early detection of tumors and for determining the prognosis. Because DNA methylation is reversible, drugs like 5′-azacytidine, decitabine, and histone deacetylase inhibitors are being used to treat a variety of tumors. Novel demethylating agents such as antisense DNA methyl transferase and small interference RNA are being developed, making the field of DNA methylation wider and more exciting.<br /><b>Reference<br /></b>Partha M.
