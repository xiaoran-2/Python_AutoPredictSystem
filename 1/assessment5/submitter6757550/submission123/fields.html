    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to

    <div class="field-value">CpG sites are DNA regions where cytosina and guanina are near, separated by a phosphate group. CpG islands are regions very rich of CpG sites and this happens in promoter genes.  DNA methylation in CpG islands determines silencing of promoter genes and so these genes don't express. <br />In cancer, CpG islands are hypermethylated and this hypermethylation decreases the expression of oncosuppressor genes and so cancer can develop and grow.The process of hypermethylation of CpG islands increases with age and also cancer,as disease, increases with age.Every type of cancer has a different set of CpG islands hypermethylated:there is a locus specific DNA hypermethylation.<br />In the genoma there are  not only CpG islands but also and above all intergenic regions and repetitive elements.  In cancer cells these regions are hypomethylated. Hypomethylation of repeats/ intergenic intervals leads to genomic instability and abnormal karyotype; deletions,reciprocal translocations and insertions ,because the hypomethylated chromatine  is not densely packaged and lets disruptions and transcriptal aberrations. <br />So,in cancer cells there is hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes and hypomethylation genome-wide that leads to global genomic instability and to increase of tumor development and growth.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprinting: genes show monoallelic parent of origin specific expression (only paternal or maternal) .  In cancer cells  there is loss of imprinting,so cells do not show imprinted genes and this happens because there is hypermethylation of imprint control regions. <br />In cancer,genes are no more imprinted ,due to hypermethylation,so they are expressed from both parental alleles or silent from both parental alleles.<br />In normal cells Igf2H19 is methylated on the paternal allele and is unmethylated on the mathernal allele. The gene is not expressed in the maternal allele,in the paternal allele Igf2 is expressed because of methylation. But when there is methylation also of the maternal allele it results in loss of imprinting,Igf2 is expressed in a double dose and,since Igf2 is growth promoting ,this situation gives origin to cancer and precisely to Wilms tumor, a child cancer ,often congenital.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a new drug approved by FDA ( and also in Italy where I live) to treat a particular type of cancer,the myelodisplastic syndrome.This cancer affect mainly elderly patients,above seventy years of age.<br />If the mechansm of cancer development and growth involves epygenetic changes, then it is possible to treat this cancer with a grug which switches the genes on or off and so changes the expression of that gene.<br />Decitabine belongs to the class of epygenetic inhibitors which work as DNA demethylating agents.The researchers found that in cancer cells there is hypermethilation of CpG islands,regions of genoma rich of promoter genes.This hypermethylation leads to silencing of oncosuppressor genes and to development of cancer. Decitabine acts stopping this mechanism of hypermethylation and acts mainly on dividing cells so mainly on cancer cells which divide the most.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The Economist article describes the research of dr. Stephen Baylin and his group about a combination of drugs ,a histone-deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine,for people with advanced lung cancer.Besides having a good effect for the first time on a solid tumor,these drugs showed to improve the response of the patients to routine chemotherapeutic agents given on them next.<br />It seems that these epygenetic drugs alter the cancer cells in some lasting way.   These drugs belong to the group of demethylators:stopping the hypermethylation in the CpG islands,regions rich of promoter genes,these drugs let the expression of the oncosuppressor gene and stop the cancer growth.Since the epygenetic changes are mithotycally hereditable,these changes are transmitted to all the daughters and grandaughters cells and so on. The population of daughter cells are no more hypermethylated and so are more susceptible to standard therapy.<br />In using epygenetic drugs,researchers must pay attention to some critical period in which this therapy could be dangerous.In fact there are life periods which are more sensible to epygenetic changes,when there is embryonic development and gametes formation.For this reason the use of epygenetic drugs must be considered with caution in the pregnant woman and in young people .<br /></div>
