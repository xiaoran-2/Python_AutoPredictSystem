    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is used in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia. Decitabine is an epigenetic inhibitor that belongs to the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, it's a cytidine analog that inhibits the DNA methyltransferase. It irreversibly binds to DNMT after it is incorporated in the DNA upon replication. Its mechanism of action isn't clearly understood but it results in an demethylation of the DNA and a disruption of epigenetic marks that is division dependent. <br /><br />Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect because if the loss of methylation occurs at the CpGs island shore or the CpGs islands of the promotor of tumor suppressor genes will result in the reexpression of these tumor-suppressor genes (hypermethylation of tumor-suppressor gene is frequent in cancer cells). <br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is one of the epigenetic marks that is passed stably onto the daughter cells via mitosis. If DNA methylation is lost in one cell it will be also in the daughter cells. <br />A sensitive period is a period when the epigenome is sensitive to effect from the environment (when the epigenetic marks are established).<br />There are 2 sensitive periods: the period of the formation of the germline progenitors, i.e., from the formation of the primordial germ cells (PGC) to the production of the ovules or spermatozoides; and the early development of the embryo (preimplantation and early post implantation, when epigenetics marks are established).<br /><br />Treating patients during sensitive periods would not be advisable, because those drugs could affect all the cells and potentially could influence not only the person being treated but the next 2 generations (alterating the establishment of epigenetic marks, imprinted genes...). <br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is altered in cancer.<br />In normal cells, the methylation at the CpGs islands of a promotor are indicative of a tighter chromatin structure and of the gene not being expressed. When the CpGs island are hypomethylated or not methylated, the chromatin is more open, transcription factors can bind it and the gene is expressed.<br />In cancer cells, the genome is widely hypomethylated but there are clusters of hypermethylated DNA at CpGs (CIMP). Depending on the tumor type, the CpGs islands of tumor-suppressor genes are often hypermethylated (leading to their repression) and the CpGs islands of the promotors of oncogenes are often hypomethylated, thus the oncogenes are overexpressed in comparaison to normal cells. <br />The disruption of DNA methylation in cancer hence leads to either or a combination of the activation of CpGs poor gene – for example oncogene – and the repression of tumor suppressor genes (for example BRCA1 or RB), leading to tumor growth. <br /><br /> In normal cells, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated, in these regions, the chromatin is tightely packed, avoiding easy access or activation of the repetitive elements that could contribute to genomic instability. <br />In cancer cells, the genome is widely hypomethylated. The DNA methylation of the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are disrupted in cancer because these regions are hypomethylated. As a result, an increase in genomic instability is seen. There are recombinations between repetitive elements, activation of repeated elements and transposon. These can generate insertions, deletions and translocations of chromosomes or parts of chromosomes. The hypomethylation of repeats will also lead to activation of cryptic promotor and disruptions of neighboring genes. It can lead to the formation of new proteins that will contribute to cancer, expression of oncogenes or repression of tumor suppressor genes.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer as we will see with the H19/Igf2 cluster.<br />In the paternal allele, the ICR (imprinted control region) upstream of the H19 gene is methylated, impeding the binding of the insulator protein CTCF. When CTCF isn't able to bind the methylated ICR (paternal allele), the heterochromatin spread to the neighboring region and DNA methylation spreads to H19 promotor, silencing it. The enhancers downstream of H19 aren't impeded to bind Igf2, and Igf2 gene is expressed.<br /><br />In the maternal allele, the ICR isn't methylated, the insulator CTCF can bind it. As a consequence of CTCF binding, the preferred Igf2 loop for the enhancers isn't accessible, Igf2 isn't expressed, but H19 is accessible to the enhancer and is expressed.<br /><br />in Wilm's tumor, the imprinting H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted because both the paternal and the maternal alleles are hypermethylated at the ICR, CTCF can't bind and Igf2 is accessible on both alleles to the effects of the enhancers resulting in the over expression of Igf2 (2 times more than in normal cells).<br /><br />Igf2 is an oncogene (promote tumor growth), its over expression resulting from the disruption of the imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.<br /><br /></div>
