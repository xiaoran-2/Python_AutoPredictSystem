    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at CpG islands, is found at the promoters of genes and regulates the expression of these genes. In general, when the Cytosines dinucleotides at the promoter of a gene are methylated, the gene cannot be expressed. <b>In normal cells, CpG islands are hypomethylated</b> but <b>the repetitive elements, the intergenic regions and the introns of genes are methylated.</b><br /><br />In Cancer, <b>CpG islands are hypermethylated</b> and these genes are <b>not expressed.</b> The <b>repetitive elements, the intergenic regions and the introns of genes</b> are <b>hypomethylated,</b> <b>they are active and may cause genomic instability. <br /></b><br /><p>In cancer, when the
promoters at the<b> </b><b>CpG
islands of tumor suppressor genes are hypermethylated</b>, the <b>tumor suppressor genes are silenced, the cells can divide more
frequently</b> and
it contributes to cancer. This is due to alterations in all classes of the
epigenetic machinery, including mutations in DNA methyltransferases and the Tet
proteins which remove DNA methylation. DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and it is a very efficient way of gene silencing, mainly tumor suppressor genes.It is why it is selected for. It gives to the cancer cell a competitive advantage over the surrounding cells and it will divide more frequently than the others. <span><br /><br />In a normal cell, <b>the intergenic regions and
the repetitive elements are rmethylated and are not expressed</b>. This contributes to<b> </b><b>genomic stability.</b><br /><br />
In cancer, there is<b> </b><b>hypomethylation in
intergenic regions and repetitive elements. These elements are active and may
cause genomic instability.</b> <br /><br />In cancer, when <b>intergenetic regions and
repetitive elements are hypomethylated, they are active and cause genomic
instability.</b> These elements can <b>align
or misalign and cause illegitimate recombinations. They can also cause aberrant
transcription of neighboring genes. They can be activated, copied, transposed
and cause deletions or insertions with gain or loss of parts of chromosomes. </b>This
is how they contribute to cancer.</span></p>.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the H19/lgf2 cluster, the Imprint Control Region is <b>methylated on the paterna</b>l allele and <b>unmethylated on the maternal</b> allele.<br />On the paternal allele, the Imprint Control Region is methylated, the CTFC insulated element cannot bind to it and the enhancers can act on Igf2.<b> Igf2 is expressed on the paternal allele.</b><br /><br />On the maternal allele, the Imprint Control Region is ummethylated and the CTFC insulated element will bind to it, the enhancers will act on <b>H19 but  igf2 is not expressed on the maternal allele.<br /></b><br />In Wilm's tumor, the Imprint Control Region of the maternal and the paternal alleles <b>are both unmethylated </b>and <b>Igf2 is expressed on both alleles.</b> <br /><br />With the loss of imprinting of the maternal allele, <b>Igf2 is expressed on both alleles</b> and <b>there is a double dose of the insulin-like growyh factor 2 protein</b> which promotes the growth and proliferation of cells. This will contribute to cancer. <br /><br /><b></b></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the <b>DNA methyl transferase inhibitors class and is called a hypomethylizing agent.</b><br /><br />Decitabine is similar to 5-azacytidine and <b>inhibits the DNA methyl transferase DNMT1</b>. It is a <strong>cytosine analog</strong> and substitutes the cytosine component of the CpG which is the target of DNMT1. <b>Decitabine is incorporated into the DNA during replication</b> and prevents DNA methylation of CpG islands by <strong>irreversibly binding DNMT1 which can no longer be released</strong>. <b>The action of Decitabine is dependant on cell division, a cell must divide in a order for Decitabine to work.</b> Cancer cells divide more rapidly than normal cells and they will be more affected than normal cells.<br /><br />Decitabine prevents <b>DNA methylation of the CpG islands on many types of tumor suppressor genes</b> which allows them to be <b>re-expressed and have an anti-tumor effect.</b><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><b>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable </b>and the cancer cells use it as a very good mechanism of tumor suppressor genes silencing. Epigenetic drugs that alter DNA methylation are reversing this process and in the case of <b>Decitabine, the DNA methylation inhibition is passed on during cell division to all the cell future generations. many types of tumor suppressor genes may be re-expressed and prevent cell proliferation.</b><br /><br />A sensitive period is a period of <b>epigenetic reprogramming, which includes big changes in DNA methylation, during primordial germ cell development and embryonic development.</b><br /><br />Sensitive periods of development are the <b>pre-implantation period, the early development period and the primordial germ cell development period.</b><br /><br />Treating patients with <b>DNMT inhibitor drugs during the sensitive periods described above may cause fetal harm</b> <b>because the drug alters DNA methylation.</b> According to the FDA drug label, It is not recommended for use for women during pregnancy or a few months for men and women before trying to have a baby because<b> it may cause fetal harm. </b></div>
