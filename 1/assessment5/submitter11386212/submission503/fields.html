    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normally the CpG islands are hypomethylated however in cancer the CpG islands are hypermethylated especially in the promoter of the tumor suppressor gene to silence it and therefore it is considered one of the hits that contribute to cancer. Normally the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements are hypermethylated however in cancer they are hypomethylated leading to genomic instability which leads to many consequences such as illegitimate recombination between repeats or activation of repeats and transpostion or activation of some promoters and disruption of neighboring genes such as the Avy and the Axin fused allele <br /> </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normally the ICR of the maternal allele is unmethylated so CTFC binds to it so the enhancers will act on H19 and the Igf2 is silenced while the ICR of the paternal allele is methylated so in this case CTFC will not bind so the enhancers will lead finally to the activation and expression of Igf2 <br />With imprinting the ICR will be hypermethylated in the paternal and the maternal allele as well leading to expression of Igf2 on both alleles so we have double dose of Igf2 compared to normal cell and at the same time Igf2 is growth promoting leading to Wilm's tumour <br />Disruption of imprinting whether by hypermethylation or hypomethylation is seen in preneoplastic cells which suggests that this could be early events in tumorgenesis </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor. It is a hypomethylating agent as it hypomethylates the DNA by irreversibly binding to the DNA methyltransferase . It is used for the treatment of Myelodysplastic syndrome <h1><br /></h1></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that alter the DNA methylation such as the DNMT inhibitors tend to have enduring effect on the epigenome as they act on the daughter DNA so they are replication dependant. <br />Sensitive period is the period during which the epigenetic marks are established or reprogrammed and they are during early development and during germ cell development.<br />Treating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable because during those phases the epigenetic marks which are the target in treatment are not stable however they are reprogrammed </div>
