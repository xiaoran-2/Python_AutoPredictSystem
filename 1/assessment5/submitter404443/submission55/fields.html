    <h1>Submission 55 from Anon (session_user_id: 0d2006e289da98dd0144f0e3472c454962a2f7f8)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA-methyltransferase.<br />A tumour my depend on silencing of one or several tumour suppressor genes by methylation of their promoter. During mitosis, DNA-methyltransferase is needed to transfer methylation to newly synthesized DNA strands of daughter cell, thus an inhibitor will reduce existing methylation patterns in the daughter cells and thus Decitabine reduces hypermethylation over time in proliferating cancer cells, thus e.g. reactivating silenced tumour suppressor genes.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Methylation at CpG islands of promoters silences gene expression. Therefore CpG islands are usually hypomethylated. In tumours, general hypermethylation of CpG islands can be observed, often especially evident in CpG islands of promoters of tumour suppressor genes. This supports or is required for tumour growth as these genes, respectively their associated proteins, play key roles in cell reactions against tumours like apoptosis. <br />Repetitive elements are usually hypermethylated for repression. In cancer these regions are hypomethylated, leading to genomic instability and thus higher mutation rate.<br />The methylation patterns of intergenic regions are part of the overall regulation of gene expression. In tumour cells a general hypomethylation can  be observed, leading to a perturbed proteasom and thus loss of growth control.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the paternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster, the CpG island of the imprint control region (ICR) is methylated, as opposed to the maternal allele. The methylation denies docking of the CTCF transcriptional repressor, allowing the transcriptional enhancer in the cluster to enhance expression of IGF2 paternally while keeping IGF2 repressed on the maternal allele.<br />The expression pattern of H19, located downstream of ICR, is precisely opposite: docking of CTCF directs the enhancer effect to H19, which therefore is expressed on the maternal allele fully and repressed on the paternal allele.<br />In a model for Wilm's tumour, also the maternal ICR is methylated. Thus, IGF2 is over expressed, while H19 is completely repressed. Now H19 has a slowing effect on cell growth, while IGF2 is a growth factor. Thus this type of mutation will enhance cell growth.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">As DNA methylation is heritable during mitosis, altering methylation patterns has an enduring effect as the altered methylation patterns are subsequently inherited. However, unspecific drugs affecting methylation at all DNA sites means that it simply disturbs, respectively removes, current methylation patterns. In cases where the problem is that e.g. genes in apoptotic signalling pathways are silenced, so that after removal of methylation the cell simply dies, this is no problem. However, if the cell is supposed to function after the treatment, this will have severe side effects if not being simply debilitating. This is even more so for cells which undergo active methylation to establish enduring, wild type methylation pattern: this methylation process will be severely disturbed and the disturbed pattern will endure because of heritability of methylation patterns. <br />So administration of such a drug is ill advised during periods of methylation pattern establishment which is why such a period is called sensitive.<br />There are two especially sensitive periods during development: pre implantation period and mid-gestation period. In general, whenever cells differentiate, the methylation pattern are changed.<br /><span class="_wysihtml5-temp"></span></div>
