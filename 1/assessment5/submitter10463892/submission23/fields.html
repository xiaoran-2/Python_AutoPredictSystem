    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are usually found at promoters of genes which demarcate the start sites of gene expression. They are usually unmethylated, therefore methylation of these CpG islands results in lack of gene expression due to silencing. The silencing phenomenon is as a result of the chromatin structure being repressed and subsequent lack of binding of transcription factors.<br />In cancer cells, CpG islands are hypermethylated in comparison to normal cells where they are hypomethylated. Since these islands are found at the promoters of tumour suppressor genes, their hypermethylation will consequently result in silencing of these genes leading to the formation of tumours and hence cancer.<br />Conversely, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated.<br />Methylation of intergenic regions serves to maintain the integrity of the genome as studies have shown that cells lacking the enzyme DNA methyl transferase 1 which lays down methylation display abnormal karyotypes such as chromosome deletions, insertions, duplications and so on and this is due to genomic instability. In addition, methylation of intergenic regions serves to silence cryptic transcription start sites which may interfere with the normal transcription of genes. The methylation also silences cryptic splice sites to prevent binding of the splicing machinery thus avoid unwanted splicing of genes.<br />Methylation of repetitive elements also maintains genomic integrity by silencing or mutating to prevent transposition, it prevents illegitimate recombination and silencing these repeat also prevents them from causing transcriptional interference when in the vicinity of strong promoters. <br />In cancer cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated compared to normal cells where they are hypermethylated. This means that genomic integrity will be compromised due to an increase in genomic instability because in this case, there will be abnormal karyotypes, no silencing of cryptic transcription start sites and splice sites, occurrence of transposition, illegitimate recombination and transcriptional interference.  <br /><br /> </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">According to the review article: <i><b>Abramowitz LK, Bartolomei MS. (2012)</b></i>, the H19/Igf2 cluster utilizes the insulator model of imprinting. <br />The paternal allele of this cluster contains an imprint control region (ICR) that is methylated therefore it is paternally imprinted. Downstream of this ICR is the H19 gene whose promoter is also methylated due to spreading of methylation from the ICR. Consequently, this gene is silenced. The insulator protein, CTCF, can not bind to this ICR thus enhancers found downstream can bind to the Igf2 gene that is upstream of the ICR and activate it's expression.<br />Conversely, the ICR on the maternal allele is not methylated therefore CTCF can bind to it and this prevents the binding of downstream enhancers to Igf2 thus it's not expressed. However, the enhancers bind to H19 and activate its expression.<br />In Wilm's tumour, the maternal allele ICR which is usually unmethylated is methylated just like the ICR on the paternal allele resulting in overexpression of the growth promoting gene Igf2. Disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster causes the maternal allele to behave like the paternal allele and uncontrolled expression of the Igf2 oncogene thus causing cancer.   </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyl transferase inhibitor (DNMTi). It is a nucleoside analogue which binds to DNMTs irreversibly after they are incorporated into DNA during replication. Irreversible binding of this drug to DNMTs means the enzymes can not lay down methylation resulting in passive DNA demethylation. This means that with every occurrence of cell division, there is dilution of DNA methylation due to absence of the DNMTs.<br />The hypomethylation caused by Decitabine has an anti-tumour effect but studies have shown that this occurs only when the drug is administered in low doses. At high doses it has a toxic effect. However, the mechanism of action of this drug is yet to be unraveled.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methlation is an epigenetic mark that is mitotically heritable. Hypermethylation of ICRs results in loss of imprinting causing activation of oncogenes whereas genomewide hypomethylation contributes to genomic instability and in some cases activation pf oncogenes. <strong><br /></strong>A sensitive period refers to that point in time when epigenetic reprogramming occurs. During this period, there is clearing of epigenetic marks to restore totipotency and this is followed by resetting of these marks in a lineage specific manner.<br />The sensitive periods of development are during primordial germ cell development and early embryonic development i.e. pre-implantation and post-implantation period.<br />Treating patients during sensitive periods is not advisable because all the cells in the body have the potential to be affected by the drugs used including the germ cells. Therefore the effect of these drugs on these cells needs to be taken into account first. </div>
