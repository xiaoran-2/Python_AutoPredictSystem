    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cells, CpG islands (CGI) are generally <strong>hypo</strong>methylated to allow promoter and associated neighboring gene function to occur. In cancer, CGI may become <strong>hyper</strong>methylated, silencing promoter and subsequent gene expression. If the involved gene's function relates to tumor suppression, errors in cell development may occur or be allowed to survive, contributing to cancer development. <br /><br />In normal cells, intergenic and repetitive elements should be <strong>hyper</strong>methylated to suppress their expression, but they tend to become <strong>hypo</strong>methylated during cancer cell development. The genomic instability that results from the lack of constraint on these elements allows illegitimate recombinations such as translocations to occur, contributing to the accumulation of errors that result in cancer development. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the video 7.3 example, the normal cell state showed that the paternal allele's imprint control region (ICR) was methylated, and the maternal allele's ICR was unmethylated. The paternal allele showed silencing of both the ICR and the H19 gene, which allowed the enhancers to stimulate expression of IGF2. As the maternal ICR was unmethylated, H19 was functional, which resulted in no IGF2 expression. In the Wilm's tumor example, when both maternal and paternal alleles demonstrated methylation of the ICR, H19 was silenced in both, and double the "dose" of IGF2 was expressed. IGF2 is a growth promoting gene, therefore, overexpression contributes to inappropriate growth of cancer cells.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is described in the Economist article as belonging to the DNA-demethylating class of agents, and appears to work by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase, which deposits methyl marks. Inhibition of methylation in a cancer cell may reverse the inappropriate silencing of tumor suppressor genes and other adaptations that the cancer cell may have developed to survive and proliferate, which become mitotically heritable, passing to cancerous daughter cells. The use of decitabine to treat cancer cells may "erase" the inappropriate deposits of methylation that were laid down, and may return the cell to a more normal type of function, including reversal of the "immortal " state.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">If a cancer cell has developed epigenetic marks that influence genes to protect that cell from the effects of chemotherapy, "erasing" these inappropriate marks will permanently leave the cancer cell more vulnerable to destruction by chemotherapy as normal cells are, resulting in a better therapeutic response for the patient. Though this is valuable, caution is required as there are times when attempts to manipulate DNA methylation may have enduring negative effects on the epigenome of normal cells, such as during the sensitive periods of early embryonic and primordial germ cell development. Epigenetic reprogramming normally occurs during these sensitive periods, and introduction of agents that alter DNA methylation could disrupt how appropriate marks, such as those to repetitive elements are laid down, causing unforeseen and potentially harmful changes such as increased genomic instability. For these reasons, treating patients during sensitive periods, such as while pregnant or while germ cells are produced is inadvisable.<br /></div>
