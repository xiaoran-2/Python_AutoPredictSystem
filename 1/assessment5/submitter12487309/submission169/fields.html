    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normally CpG islands use to be hypomethylated which means that they are active. In cancer the CpG islands at certain specific locus (specific for each tumour type) are hypermethylated, and this way tumour supressor genes can be inactivated. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated in a normal cell, but in cancer they are hypomethylated and that leads to a more open chromatin which contributes to genomic instability (making the chromatin accessible for recombinations, deletions, insertions, and activation of promoters).</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Hyper- or hypomethylation of imprint control regions can result in overexpression of growth promoters, or loss of expression of growth restricting genes. Normally the paternal allele is methylated at the imprint control region which leads to expression of Igf2 and the  maternal allele is unmethylated (CTCF can bind here and lead to expression of H19 but not of Igf2).<br />In cancer imprinting can be lost and both alleles will then be methylated and expressing Igf2, promoting growth. This is what happens in Wilm's tumour.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyl transferase inhibitor (DNMTi). It is used in myelodysplastic syndrome when it is progressing to AML, but it might be effective also on other kinds of cancer cells that are heavily methylated. Maybe best effect when combined with other drugs, a synergistic effect. <br />Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue and it is incorporated into DNA upon replication. When methylation should be copied the drug binds to DNMT. This binding is irreversible and inactivates DNMT, thus leading to demethylation. The effect is more pronounced in cells that are rapidly replicating, like cancer cells, but the drug affects the whole body. Best antineoplastic effect is seen at a relatively low dose.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">A cancer cell could have epigenetic marks that promote growth, or that make them less sensitive to growth restriction genes. A drug that alters DNA methylation could change these epigenetic marks back to normal again, and this effect would also be transmitted to daughter cells, making the cells more sensitive to the effects of chemotherapy. Although this could be effective when trying to treat patients with cancer, it is less advisable in children due to the risk of longterm effects. Children are still growing and developing, and while doing so they need to be able to methylate DNA, so that they can lay down appropriate epigenetic marks in different tissues. Childhood, early fetal development and the development of primordial germ cells, are sensitive periods when reprogramming of epigenetic marks are taking place.<br /></div>
