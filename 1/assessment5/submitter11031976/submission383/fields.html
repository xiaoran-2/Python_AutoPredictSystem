    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are mostly unmethylated. DNA methylation of CpG islands is dynamic and mostly associated with inactivation or gene silencing as these CpG clusters tend to be located at the promoter region. The methylated CpG can lead to either chromatin condensation or prevent transcription factor binding leading to inhibition of gene expression. In the former case, the methylated CpG is bound by methylated CpG binding proteins(MeCP) which have a DNA binding domain and transcriptional repression domain. In addition, the MeCP can also attract other proteins to bind to it and cause chromatin condensation.<br />In cancer, the CpG islands are locus specifically hypermethylated. The hypermethylation occurs at the CGI of promoters of tumour suppressor genes leading to their silence causing loss of control of cell-cycle, failure of apoptosis or no DNA repair. But metastasis occurs only when there are multiple hits i.e., the tumour suppressor genes on both alleles have to be silenced in addition to activation of certain oncogenes. For some cancers specific sets or multiple genes need to be silenced by hypermethylation of CGI for all those genes respectively.<br />Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated which lends genomic stability to the cell. In case of tumour cells, these intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated. Methylation prevents the repetitive elements from transpositioning and prevents unwanted recombinations by keeping chromatin condensed. In cancer, hypomethylation of these regions and elements leads to unwanted insertions, deletions and reciprocal translocations occurring randomly genome-wide. meC mutates into T which also checks transposon jumping. And even if transposition occurs, methylation prevents the strong promoters of repetitive elements from causing transcriptional interference of surrounding genes. Thus, disruption of DNA methylation not only leads to activation of oncogenes by hypomethylation of intergenic regions but also causes genomic instability by rendering the repetitive elements devoid of methylation.<br /> </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The H19/Igf2 cluster of genes is paternally imprinted as it is methylated on the paternal chromosome leading to expression of Igf2. The ICR on the paternal allele is methylated making it unavailable to CTCF(the insulator protein) and aiding spread of methylation towards the promoter of H19(lncRNA). So the enhancers located downstream help the expression of Igf2.<br />In case of the maternal allele, the ICR remains unmethylated and therefore, open to binding by CTCF. CTCF bound to ICR insulates Igf2 from the enhancers located downstream. H19 promoter also remains unmethylated and the lncRNA from H19 binds to the enhancers which loop towards it due to unavailability of Igf2. Thus, Igf2 is not expressed from the maternal allele.<br />In case of Wilm's tumour, Igf2 is over-expressed. Either the H19/Igf2 cluster on the maternal allele is completely disrupted by mutation or deletion leading to the maternal allele acting as the paternal one. Or there can be uniparental disomy or two copies of chromosomes from the same parent(in this case the father) causing over expression of Igf2. Igf2 is an oncogene, hence its over-expression due to any of the aforementioned abnormalities which also disrupt the expression of Cdkn1c(tumour suppressor gene), contributes to cancer. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a belongs to the DNMTi(de novo methyl transferase inhibitor) class of epigenetic inhibitors. It is a nucleoside analogue which incorporates itself into the DNA, therefore, when the DNMT comes to bind to the replicating DNA, it is rather irreversibly bound to the DNMTi. This prevents the methyl transferase release and thus, methylation of the daughter strand does not take place. So Decitabine requires a replicating DNA for proper action and DNA replication occurs in multiplying cells. Cancerous cells divide very rapidly and decitabine binds to their DNA inhibiting methylation and further hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes, thus, checking metastasis.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have lasting effects because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and these drugs not only affect the tumourigenic cells but also normal cells. Somatic maintenance is a normal process in adults. So unmethylated DNA inherited by daughter cells can inhibit or activate otherwise, silent genes. Mostly in younger patients the germ cells can be affected as these undergo the sensitive periods of epigenetic reprogamming.<br />Sensitive period can be defined as the time during which active epigenome reprogramming takes place by removal and formation of new epigenetic marks across the whole genome. It is during this that the epigenome is highly susceptible to effects by external environmental factors. The two sensitive periods are during primordial germ cell formation and production of mature oocytes and sperms; and during pre-implantation(fertilization) and early post-implantation. So treating patients with epigenetic drugs during these sensitive periods will have lasting effects through multiple generations to come as these time periods are critical to epigenetic remodelling and laying of marks which are inheritable. These drugs might also interfere with epigenomic reprogamming during organogenesis because there are tissue-specific remodelling that are maintained throughout an individual's life. <br /><br /><br /></div>
