    <div class="field-value">    Epigenetic marks are altered in a variety of ways in cancer.  One way is by changing the level of DNA methylation, either by decreasing the amount of methylation or increasing it.<br />    CpG islands are found in promoters of tumor suppressor genes.  In normal cells, the DNA bases in CpG islands are hypomethylated, meaning that methylation levels are low.  With low methylation, the suppressor genes are expressed and therefore tumor formation is suppressed.  In cancer cells, the epigenetic marks are different.  The bases of the CpG islands are methylated, resulting in a hypermethylated state.  With the addition of methyl groups, the promoter is silenced and the suppressor genes are not expressed.  Because the formation of tumors is no longer suppressed, cell division for tumor formation takes place.  Because epigenetic marks are heritable, the new epigenetic marks will be passed to new tumor cells as the cells divide.<br />    In contrast to CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated in normal cells.  These marks are important for genome stability.  Correct chromosome exchanges occur and transposons do not move or proliferate in the genome.  In cancer cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements become hypomethylated, resulting in the loss of genome stability.  The loss of stability results in mutations such as incorrect exchanges occurring between non-homologous chromosomes as well as movement and proliferation of transposons.  As the genome alterations increase, cancer develops.<br /><br />This answer is based on information in Lecture 7.2.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">    The <em>H19/Igf2 </em>cluster consists of the <em>Igf2</em> gene, an imprint control region (ICR), the <em>H19</em> gene, and two transcription enhancers. <br />    The <em>H19/Igf2 </em>gene cluster of the paternal chromosome 11 is imprinted; the ICR is methylated.  CTCF, an insulator protein, cannot bind to the methylated ICR.  Without the insulator protein in place, the enhancers can interact with the ICR.  This results in expression of <em>Igf2</em>, but not of <em>H19</em>.<br />    The maternal chromosome 11 is not imprinted and therefore lacks the methylation of the ICR.  CTCF can bind to this ICR.  The enhancer regions cannot associate with the ICR when CTCF is in place and instead interact with <em>H19</em>.  <em>H19</em> is expressed to produce a long noncoding RNA molecule; <em> Igf2</em> is not expressed.<br />    In Wilms’ tumor, the ICR on both the paternal and maternal chromosomes is methylated.  This results in the expression of both copies of the <em>Igf2</em> gene, doubling the amount of Igf2 protein that is present.  Igf2 is a growth promoting protein associated with development of Wilms’ tumor.<br /><br />This answer is based on information in Lectures 4.4 and 7.3.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine inhibits DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs).  It is a nucleoside analog. When DNA is replicated during cell division, Decitabine is inserted into the new DNA strand instead of the authentic nucleoside.  When the DNMT comes along to methylate the new DNA strand, it encounters the Decitabine and binds to the analog irreversibly.  As a consequence, the methyl groups, which are the epigenetic marks in this case, are not applied to the new DNA.  Chemicals like Decitabine are most effective in rapidly dividing cells, like cancer cells, because DNA is replicated as part of the division process.  The treated cells would have hypomethylated DNA.  For cancer treatment, chemicals like Decitabine would be most effective against cancers in which hypermethylation of DNA increases tumorgenicity.<br /><br />This answer is based on information in Lecture 7.9.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">    Altering DNA methylation patterns can have lasting effects on the epigenome because epigenetic marks are heritable.  The marks will be passed to daughter cells when the treated tumor cells divide.  <br />    Drugs that alter DNA methylation patterns should not be given during sensitive periods because normal epigenetic reprogramming takes place then. There are two sensitive periods. The first period lasts from formation of a zygote until implantation of the blastocyst.  During this period both DNA methylation and histone marks are removed.  Following implantation, the marks are reapplied, with the process complete by the epiblast stage.  From this point, somatic cells will keep the epigenetic marks. The second period is during formation of the primordial germ cells and gametes.  The marks applied during the first sensitive period are removed during formation of the primodial germ cells and reapplied during formation of the gametes.<br />    Drugs that affect DNA methylation should not be given be given to younger patients because the drugs could affect normal epigenetic reprogramming of primordial germ cells and gametes and, in the event of pregnancy, could interfere with the normal epigenetic reprogramming of the embryo.  <br /><br />This answer is based on information in Lectures 4.1  and 7.9.<br /></div>
