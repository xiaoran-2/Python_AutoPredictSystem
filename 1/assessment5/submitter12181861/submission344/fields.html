    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The global level of methylation in
normal tissue progressively decreases through to a
metastatic tissue whereas the methylation in some CpG islands increases causing in cancer evading growth supressor, sustaining proliferative signaling, resisting cell
death, activating metastase and causing imortallity replication and lost of imprinting. The
methylation can be locus specific causing hypermethylation and so silencing tumor supressor genes or genome wide causing hypomethylation and activation of
repetitive elements. In normal cells there are hypomethylations in some CpG
islands and then activation of tumor supressor genes and hypermethylation in
intergenic regions and repetitive elements causing the silencing of these
elements.In cancer cells there are
hypermethylations in some CpG islands that will block the tumor supressor genes and hypomethylation
in intergenic regions and repetitive elements causing genomic instability by activation of repeats, illegitimate combinations, deletions or insertion and activation of surroundings genes. These methylations being
mitotically heritable pass throw the daughters cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor and causes DNA
demethylation. It is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes,
the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia<span>. The decitabine is a
nuceloside analogue that are incorporat into the DNA upon replication, and
then, when the DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) bind the nucleotide to copy the
methylation to the daughter strand, the DNMTs can’t be release because the
bound is irreversibly. The action of DNMTs inhibitors is replication dependent
and therefore cancer cells that are known by there rapid replication are more severely
affect.  </span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>A feature of cancer cells is the loss of imprinting, genes that should
have imprinted expression pass to express in both parental alleles or silent
from both parental alleles. Imprinted genes are frequentally associate with
growth genes, so alterations in DNA methylation at imprinted control regions (ICRs)
can cause loss of expression of growth restricting genes or overexpression of
growth promoting genes. In normal cells, the ICRs is methylated in paternal
allele and unmethylated in maternal allele. In the maternal allele, the CTCF binds
the insulator element unmethylated and then the enhancers can act in H19 and
the lgf2 will be silent so don’t express. In the paternal allele, the
enhancers can act in lgf2 because the CTCF can’t bind in methylated ICR to
insulate. In cancer cells, where show loss of imprinting, there are
hypermatilation of the ICR in the maternal allele so in the maternal allele
will be also expression of lgf2. Therefore, it will be double dose of lgf2 that
its a growth promoting and its associated with Wilms’’ tumour.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic
alterations like DNA methylation can be mitotically heritable, so can passed
on to daughter cells and last beyond. The sensitive period are the periods that happen
active remodelling of the epigenome where have removal and laying down of
epigenetics marks in the genome and seem to be the most sensitive to changes in
the environment. The two sensitive periods of de development are the primordial
germ cell development and the pre-implantation and early post-implantation
period. Treat young patients with drugs that inhibits the epigenetic machinery
and can effect on germ cells during these periods is complicated because these
drugs are not selective only for cancer cells, they act also in normal cells, therefore  inadvisable in periods where the epigenome is more sensitive to
the environment. </p></div>
