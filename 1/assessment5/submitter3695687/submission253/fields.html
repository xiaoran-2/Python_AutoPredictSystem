    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>

    <div class="field-value"><b>Decitabine</b> (<b>5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, 5-aza-CdR</b>, commercialized as <b>Dacogen</b>) is a nucleoside (cytidine) analog inhibitor of the enzymes collectively known as DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). As such, it is a <b>hypomethylating agent</b>. It contributes to hypomethylation through <b>incorporation</b>, after phosphorylation,<b> into newly synthesized DNA</b>, and so by affecting rapidly dividing cells (cancer cells). DNMT is trapped by a covalent complex with the modified pyrimidine and thus inhibited. Decitabine may also induce <b>proteosomal degradation of DNMT</b>, contributing to effective inhibition of promoter-specific and genomic DNA methylation. DNA demethylation thus results not actively, through removal of DNA methylation marks, but <i>passively</i>, through the dilution of existing methylated DNA by newly synthesized unmethylated DNA. <br />By <b>inhibiting further DNA methylation</b> and<b> reactivating and re-expressing previously silenced tumour suppressor genes</b>, decitabine has an anti-tumour effect. Decitabine is effective in treating myelodysplastic syndromes, acute&amp;chronic myeloid leukaemia and has also been shown to <b>radiosensitize </b>solid tumours (Wang et al, 2013).<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><b>CpG islands</b> are regions of the genome rich in a large number of CpG dinucleotide repeats, between 300 and 3000 base pairs in mammalian genomes. They are located within or near gene promoter sites. While almost all CpG dinucleotides in the genome are normally methylated and thus epigenetically silenced, <b>CpGs within CpG clusters and islands are characteristically unmethylated</b>, an important feature of gene promoters abundant in these dinucleotides that allows them to be <i>expressed </i>(transcription factors can be recruited and transcription is enabled). <br /><b>In cancer</b><b> cells,</b> <b>CpG islands are aberrantly hypermethylated and promoters thus epigenetically silenced</b>. Alongside other genes, <b>tumour suppressor genes</b> will be "turned off" and will not suppress abnormal cell growth and replication, contributing to cancer.<br />In normal mammalian cells, it is estimated that 70-80% of CpG dinucleotides are methylated (Jabbari K, Bernardi G, 2004). <b>DNA hypermethylation and silencing</b> occurs normally and predominantly in intergenic regions and repetitive elements, such as LINEs and SINEs, to sustain genomic integrity. This genomic stability is maintained by not allowing these regions and elements to be transcribed and recombined during meiosis. <b>Genome-wide DNA hypomethylation (hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements)</b> is associated with genomic instability - since <b>the regions can now be transcribed and recombined</b> - and <em>cancer initiation and progression</em>. Global DNA hypomethylation can also lead to loss of imprint and an increased risk of cancer (Hatziapostolou M, Iliopoulos D, 2011).<br />Moreover, global hypomethylation and localised hypermethylation of promoter CpG islands appear to be <i>concomitant </i>in cancer cells (Ushijima, T., 2005).<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">On the <b>paternal allele</b> of the Igf2/H19 cluster, on chromosome 11p15 region, the imprint control region (ICR) - located downstream from Igf2 and upstream of H19 - is methylated&amp;inactivated and does not allow binding of the insulator protein CTCF. Methylation then spreads to H19 promoter, inactivating it. Because of the methylation pattern of ICR and H19, <b>enhancer proteins located downstream of the cluster have access to and activate the promoter of Igf2, an oncogene</b>.<br />On the <b>maternal allele</b>, the ICR is unmethylated and allows binding of CTCF, which <b>protects upstream Igf2 from downstream enhancers</b>. Because of CTCF binding, enhancers will instead activate the promoter of H19, a tumoural suppresor gene.<br />Wilm's tumour can appear in case of <b>imprinting loss at the maternal Igf2 gene</b>&amp;Igf2 biallelic expression, or <b>methylation at the maternal ICR</b> with <b>subsequent methylation of H19 gene</b>&amp;Igf2 biallelic expression, or in case of <b>paternal uniparental disomy/duplication of 11p15 region</b> with overexpression of Igf2. These examples <i>don't include maternal Kcnq1 cluster mutations</i>, since we are <i>not </i>asked about them!<br />Imprinting disruption at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer by invariably affecting the balance between Igf2 production, <b>promoting growth</b>, and H19 production, <b>suppressing growth</b>, with a resultant uncontrollable cell growth&amp;reproduction leading to tumours.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNMT inhibitors can bind DNMTs to DNA and inhibit their ability to methylate CpGs. DNA replication is necessary for DNA to become (de)methylated (in the case of DNMT1). As such, tumours, characterized by <i>aberrantly methylated DNA and an increasing number of rapidly dividing cells</i>, are the target of these inhibitors. Under the influence of these drugs, an increased proportion of the double-stranded DNA becomes hemimethylated and eventually most will become demethylated. These changes are <b>enduring </b>since <b>demethylated DNA is passed down through replication to each new daughter cell and persists as such until cell apoptosis is induced</b>. The modified epigenome is then<i> much more susceptible to chemotherapy and radiotherapy</i>.<br />Sensitive periods are periods when the germline is particularly susceptible to environmental perturbations. These correspond to <b>1)</b> the pre-implantation through early post-implantation period of the zygote and <b>2)</b> the period of primordial germ cells (PGCs) production through the mature sperm and oocytes production. Patients shouldn't be treated during these periods because the drugs can determine epigenetic changes in<b> the fetus (F1 generation)</b> and in <b>the yet unborn children of the F1 generation </b>through PGCs<b> (F2 generation), </b>changes that will become mitotically stable and will be passed down through cell replication.<br /><br /></div>
