    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation often occurs at CpG islands, which are regions of the genome that have a cytosine directly next to a guanine. The methylation on the cytosine can be preserved via DNA methyltransferase, which copies the methylation from the cytosine on a CpG island on one strand to the other. DNA methylation in general suppresses gene transcription and can be removed during epigenetic reprogramming stages, which allows cells to reformat their gene expression. Typically, CpG islands tend to be unmethylated because methylation is mutagenic and increases the probability of a C to T mutation. However, certain critical regions are not demethylated during this process. The inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) are domains that are frequently methylated. If their methylation is disrupted, they become active and inhibit many factors that aid in apoptosis, such as caspases. This can cause the cell to be unable to initiate apoptosis, or initiate apoptosis much less frequently, which causes it to spread in relation to the other, properly methylated cells. This can lead to cancer. Another function of DNA methylation is to repress intergenic regions. These are section of DNA which do not correspond to a gene, and thus if DNA transcription is initiated there it can affect the proper functioning of the cell, by interfering with proper transcription downstream. It also suppresses repetitive elements, which are DNA sequences that appear multiple times throughout the genome. They do this because they express proteins to transfer their sequence and reintegrate it elsewhere in the genome. The intracisternal A particle (IAP) is one such element. This can lead to mutation if the repetitive element is inserted into a coding region of the DNA, which can lead to genomic instability and cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">For the H19/Igf2 cluster, the paternal ICR is imprinted and has DNA methylation. This blocks binding of CTCF, which normally insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers by inhibiting DNA looping that brings them closer together. Without CTCF, Igf2 is upregulated. In addition, the DNA methylation of the ICR spreads downstream to H19 and inhibits it. In the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated, which allows CTCF to bind to it. This prevents the enhancers from interacting with Igf2 as well as prevents the spread of DNA methylation to H19.<br /><br />Wilm's tumor can be caused by the failure of maternal imprinting. This can be caused by a mutation that prevents imprinting, uniparental disomy (meaning two copies of a paternal chromosome are kept instead of one of each), or an epigenetic disruption. Since both chromosomes are paternal, they both have a methylated ICR and thus upregulated Igf2. In addition, a gene called Cdkn1c that is expressed by the maternal allele is downregulated (since there is no maternally imprinted allele). Igf2 is an oncogene, while Cdkn1c is tumor suppressive. This means that growth is upregulated, which can lead to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, so it works to reduce overall levels of DNA methylation. It works by inhibits DNA methyltransferases, which are responsible for methylation of DNA. They need to bind to DNA to do this, so decitabine mimics DNA base and irreversibly binds to DNA methyltransferase. Since many substances in the cell bind to DNA bases, they are toxic in high doses, but at low doses they can be therapeutic. Cancer cells tend to divide more than normal cells, so they likely need to replicate the genome and maintain methylation more than normal cells. In particular, myelodysplastic syndrome may be related to excess CpG methylation, which is copied to daughter strands with DNA methyltransferases. However, the long-term effects are not well-studied yet as these kinds of drugs are typically used for end of life care.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is a critical part of the epigenome and is transferred from parent cell to daughter cell. This happens via DNA methyltransferases; part of their function is to transfer methylation (often cytosine methylation at CpG islands) from the parent strand to the daughter strands of DNA. If the DNA methylation is altered at these islands, the alteration is passed on to the daughter cell. For instance, in asymmetric stem cell division where one daughter cell differentiates and the other does not, this can lead to an overall increased presence of cells with altered DNA methylation. A sensitive period in relation to epigenetics is a time where epigenetic makeup can be changed based on the environment. These are the same periods in which the epigenetic markers are being rewritten - in the development of primordial germ cells to form mature gametes, and the period after fertilization up until the inner cell mass implants to form the blastocyst. Much like how nicotine and alcohol can affect the development of children during their growth periods, drugs to treat patients during sensitive periods can affect the epigenetic makeup of the patients and of their children due to transgenerational effects.</div>
