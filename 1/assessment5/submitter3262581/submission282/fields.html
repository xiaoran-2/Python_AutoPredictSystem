	<b>About references</b>: the assignment does not provide a section for references, so I'm
	putting them here.  The materials used for this assignment were the course materials,
	the <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168"> Economist article “Cancer's
	Epicentre”</a>, and a number of relevant pages in Wikipedia, many linked to from this
	document.
      </p>

      <p>
	To the first question: CpG islands are typically located at or near the promoters of genes.
	In normal tissue, they are typically unmethylated, thus not suppressing the expression of
	the gene (other epigenetic marks may still suppress the expression, however).  In cancer,
	but also in old age, many CpG islands are methylated, thus silencing the expression of the
	gene.  In cancer, this methylation is specific to certain genes.  In typical cases, the gene
	in question is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumour_suppressor_gene">tumour
	suppressor</a>.  The exact location of the methylation varies according to the cancer.  For
	example, breast cancer shows hypermethylation of
	the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRCA1">BRCA1</a> gene, while hypermethylation of
	the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLH1">MLH1</a> gene is typical in colorectal
	cancer.
      </p>

      <p>
	In addition, alterations in the methylation of imprint control regions (ICRs) can result in
	anomalies such as loss of expression of growth-restricting genes or overexpression of
	growth-promoting genes.  This will be discussed more in question 2.
      </p>

      <p>
	Since these modifications are mitotically heritable, they allow a rapid increase in the
	cancerous tissue compared to the non-cancerous tissue.
      </p>

      <p>
	In normal tissue, the intergenic regions, repetitive elements and even
	some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intron">introns</a> are methylated.  This helps
	maintain genetic stability.  In many cancers, methylation in many of these areas is
	disrupted (hypomethylated).  This enables illegitimate recombinations: repeats can recombine
	between different chromosomes, deletions and insertions can occur,
	and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptic_unstable_transcript">cryptic promoters</a>
	can be activated.  Not all of these changes contribute to cancer: the studies of the
	<a href="http://www.epigenome.eu/en/2,48,873">A(vy)</a> and Axin(Fu) genes show activation
	of cryptic promoters without necessarily causing cancer.

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>
	The gene
	cluster <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H19_(gene)">H19</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGF-2">igf2</a>
	is located round 11p15 in the human genome.  From upstream to downstream it consists of Igf2
	(a growth factor),
	an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomic_imprinting#Regulation">imprint control
	region</a> (ICR) and H19 (long non-coding RNA).  Further downstream there are two enhancers.
	In normal tissue, the paternal allele is imprinted at the ICR.  This imprinting spreads
	downstream to the promoter of H19, silencing its expression and allowing the enhancers
	further downstream to express Igf2.
      </p>

      <p>
	The maternal allele is not imprinted.  This allows the downstream enhancers to recruit an
	insulator protein, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTCF">CTCF</a>, which binds to the
	ICR and inhibits the expression of Igf2.  Since the promoter is not methylated, H19 is
	expressed instead.
      </p>

      <p>
	Anomalies in this structure include both alleles expressing the paternal type, typically
	caused by mutations or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniparental_disomy">uniparental
	disomy</a>.  Epigenetic causes are also possible, but rare.  This causes overexpression of
	Igf2.  In combination with loss of methylation of the
	upstream <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDKN1C">Cdkn1c</a> gene, which is a tumour
	suppressor, this can
	cause <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beckwith-Wiedemann_syndrome">Beckwith-Wiedemann
	syndrome</a>, since both changes favour growth.  Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is implicated
	in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilm's_tumour">Wilm's tumour</a>, though many other
	genetic connections have been observed, notably mutation
	of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WT1">WT1</a> in 20% of cases and inactivation
	of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAM123B">WTX</a> in 30% of cases.

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decitabine">Decitabine</a> is
	a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypomethylating_agent">DNA--demethylating agent</a>.
	It inhibits the action of DNA methyltransferases in a non-specific manner.  It works by
	irreversibly binding the DNA methyltransferase, and is replication dependent.  It is used to
	treat advanced stages
	of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelodysplastic_syndrome">myelodysplastic
	syndrome</a> (MDS) that have progressed
	to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_myeloid_leukemia">acute myeloid leukemia</a>
	(AML). The exact mechanism of action is still unclear.  Hypotheses include targeting severe
	hypermethylation of CpG islands, which is typical of myelodysplastic syndrome, and which
	limits the expression
	of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumour_suppressor_gene">tumour suppressor</a>
	genes.
      </p>

      <p>
	Since cancer cells replicate faster than normal cells, the effect is most noticeable there,
	though it is likely that all cell divisions are affected.  This potentially has significant
	long-term side effects, and is presumably one of the reasons why this treatment is applied
	to older patients where other treatment has not shown a positive outcome.  The response is
	usually very good, without the severe side effects of most other cancer therapies.

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">      <p>
	As previously
	mentioned, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypomethylating_agent">DNA-hypomethylating
	agents</a> such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decitabine">decitabine</a>
	and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azacitidine">azacitidine</a> work by altering the
	epigenome.  These actions are mitotically heritable: all daughter cells inherit the
	epigenetic changes.  It is currently a matter of research as to why these hypomethylated
	daughter cells respond better to standard chemotherapy.
      </p>

      <p>
	The action of these agents is non-specific: it affects every cell.  This is of particular
	concern in younger patients who are liable to have children.  There are two “sensitive
	periods” where the epigenome is remodeled, involving temporary far-reaching alterations to
	DNA methylation.  From the point of view of the adult human, the first and most important is
	the development of primordial germ cells through to the production of the gametes.  The
	second period is the period from pre-implantation to the production of
	the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiblast">epiblast</a>, in other words in very
	early pregnancy, a period recognized for sensitivities to other external agents such as
	tobacco and alcohol.  Any external modification of DNA methylation during either of these
	periods could have catastrophic results for the offspring.  For this reason, these agents
	are currently used only on older people.
