    <div class="field-value"><p><span>CpGs cluster into CpG
islands often on promoter genes and are found in about 60% of promoters. In
most cases, DNA methylation of promoter regions is negatively correlated with
gene expression.  CpG islands are the
exceptions. They have a high CpG density and are usually kept free of
methylation. In normal cells there are some exceptions like the x chromosome
silencing. In cancer cells CpG islands on the promoter tend to become
hypermethylated, causing the underlying gene to be silenced. In many cases the
underlying gene is a tumor suppressor gene and thus the methylation of the CpG
island inhibits tumor suppression activity</span></p>

<p><span> ( Hassler and Egger pp1 and lectures 1.5 , 7.2,
7,3)</span></p>

<p></p>

<p>CpGs in intergenic
regions are mutagenic (increase the rate of mutations mainly Cytosine to
Thymine). Thus, by natural selection, the frequency of CpGs in intragenic
regions is less than normal. They are found more frequently on repetitive
regions.</p>

<p>Methylation of intergenic
CpGs maintains genomic stability: It prevents transposition in repeats, silence
repeats to avoid transcriptional inference from strong promoters, it reduce
mutations ( C to G) and may prevent illegitimate recombination. Intragenic
methylation is present in highly expressed genes and it has been speculated
that this may repress transcriptional noise and inhibit antisense transcription.</p>

<p><span>In cancer cells there is
hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repeats (i.e. low level of
methylation). Thus causing <u>genomic instability</u> : increasing the rate of
recombination between repeats, transposition of repeats, mutations, activation
of promoters and disruption of  the
activity of neighboring genes.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><u>Normal
cell expression of lgf2 </u></p>

<p><span>The
imprinting in the H19/lgf2 cluster is done by blocking an enhancer. The H19 and
lgf2 gene share enhancers located downstream. 
An ICR (Imprint control region) is located Between the H19 and lgf2
genes. This ICR is</span>
a CTCF-dependent insulator (see in the diagram w from lecture 7.3
and a similar diagram in Abramowitz and Bartolomei (2012) pp1). In a normal
cell the paternal ICR is methylated whereas the maternal ICR is unmethylated.
Thus in the maternal the insular protein CTCF binds to the ICR and insulate the
lgf2 gene from the enhancers. Thus there is imprinting when the paternal allele
lgf2 and the maternal allele H19 are expressed.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><u>Wilm's tumor </u></p>

<p>In the Wilm's tumor
there is hypermethylation and thus loss of imprinting. The ICR of the maternal
allele is methylated as well and thus the lgf2 gene is expressed in both
alleles.</p>

<p>As the lgf2 is expressed
in both alleles its dose is doubled vs. the dose in a normal cell. As lgf2 is a
growth promoting gene the growth is disrupted. This is associated with a child
kidney tumor called Wilm's tumor.</p>

<p><span>Growth disorders is
common in ICR hypermethylation disrupting imprinting.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine
is an FDA approved medicine for  Myelodysplastic syndrome. </span></p>

<p><b>The drug is from the DNA
methyltransferase inhibitors family. </b></p>

<p><b><span>This family of drugs inhibits
the enzyme DNA methyltransferase. This enzyme is part of the epigenetic
machinery. It binds the methyl group to the second strand in a Hemi methylated
DNA after cell division.  Maintaining
methylation marks in the daughter cell after mitotic replication. </span></b></p>

<p><b><span>Thus inhibiting the DNMT enzyme dilutes
methylation marks pattern after cell division rather than maintaining it. As
cancer cells are dividing more rapidly, the effect is much more dramatic on the
cancer cells.</span></b></p>

<p>Note : In higher doze the DNA
methyltransferase inhibitors have a strong and toxic demethylation effect. In
lower doze (as in Decitabine) , it seems to be effective in killing the cancer with
not as severe side effects (long term effects are still not fully known)</p>

<p><span>The
answer is based mainly lecture 7.9 , 1.5.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span><b>Dr. Baylin speculates that the
epigenetic drugs altered the tumor cells in some lasting ways that make them
more susceptible to standard chemotherapy (Economist Apr 7 2012). The enduring
effect is as epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable passing to the daughter
and granddaughter cells unless actively erased.</b> <span>Methylation marks are an example to that: after cell division
the Hemi methylated DNA is a substrate to the de novo methyltransferase enzyme
that binds to the methyl group ( see lecture 1.5) </span></span></p><b>

</b>

<p><span>Sensitive
periods are periods of excessive epigenetic reprograming.  Epigenetic reprograming takes place throughout
development. However there are two periods in which excessive reprograming
takes place:  During primordial germ cell
development and in early development. If we disrupt the epigenetic processes in
these periods we take the risk of disorders and as epigenetic marks are
mitotically heritable might be for the whole life of the patient. Thus it would
not be recommended to use epigenetic drugs like decitabine in these periods.<span class="_wysihtml5-temp-placeholder"></span></span></p></div>
