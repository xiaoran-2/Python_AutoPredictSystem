    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value">CpG islands exist in both intergenic regions and promoter regions. Normally CpG islands in promoter regions are not methylated, except in the case of X-inactivation and cancer. Non-promoter CpG islands are commonly found in transposable elements such as retrotransposons and intracisternal A particles (IAP's), These are genomic parasites that are relics of ancient viral infection and are capable of translocation with or without replication. CpG island methylation of transposons silences them and prevents them from translocating to actively transcribed genes. <br />In cancer global hypomethylation with local CpG island hypermethyation is observed. <br />Since greater than 50% of promoter region contain CpG islands, in cancer these can become methylated which leads to silencing of the gene, if this gene is a tumour suppressor then this can contribute to the aetiology of cancer. <br />In cancer  intergenic regions are methylated which affects overall chromatin structure by condensing intergenic regions into heterochromatin. Because methylation often spreads, this means that surrounding functioning genes can be silenced, leading to further progression of a cancer state. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The imprint control region of the paternal H19/igf2 cluster is methylated, this prevents CTCF binding and prevents enhancer blocking, thus allowing the gene's enhancers to promote transcription of Igf2.<br />In the maternal allele the imprint control region is unmethylated and this leads to CTCF binding, this then blocks access by the enhancers to the Igf2 exon, so silences Igf2 on the maternal chromosome.<br />If both copies of the Igf2 cluster are imprinted to look like the paternal copy then there is double the wild type dose of Igf2 being expressed. Since Igf2 is growth promoting this can result in uncontrolled proliferation and the development of an oncogenic state. This sort of aberrant methylation whereby the imprint control regions of both maternal and paternal Igf2 clusters are methylated ha been shown to be present inn Wilm's tumour.<br /><span class="_wysihtml5-temp"></span><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The chemotherapeutic drug <span>Decitabine is a DNA-Demethylating agent, a class of drug that removes methylation marks.<br /></span><span>Decitabine removes methylation thereby derepressing repressed tumour suppressors.<br /></span><span>Decitabine can have an anti-tumourigenic effect by returning the epigenetic landscape to a more natural state by decreasing local methylation.</span> <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic changes such as changes in methylation status at a given locus are mitotically heritable - so if a drug were given that altered methylation status then these change can be passed down to daughter cells and all subsequent generations long after the drug has been cleared. <br />A sensitive period is a window of time during which the epigenome is undergoing global change - for example reprogramming between generations and during X-chromosome inactivation.<br />The sensitive periods in mammals are during germ cell development, and after fertilisation, but before implantation of the blastocyst. <br />Aside from the mitotic heritability of epigenetic changes which could affect the health of the individual if they were to be exposed to epigenome-altering drugs during a sensitive period, there is also putative evidence for transgenerational epigenetic inheritance via the gametes at a restricted subset of loci - for example, those metastable epialleles that have formed as a result of an intracisternal A particle translocating into an exon. If drug treatment altered the epigenetic marks associated with such loci, there is a possibility that these changes could be passed down to future generations. </div>
