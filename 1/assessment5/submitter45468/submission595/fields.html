    <div class="field-value">Dinucleotide clusters of CpGs (also known as "CpG Islands" or CGIs) can be found in the promoter and exon regions of almost 40% of mammalian genomes. During normal function, CpG islands tend to be protected from methylation. A large number of experiments have shown that methylation of CpG islands is crucial in a number of important biological function including gene silencing, X-chromosome inactivation, and carcinogenesis. In cancer, CpG islands are observed hypermethylated, in which state they effect gene silencing by forming a repressive chromatin structure and prohibiting gene transcription factors. CpG island methylation contributes to cancer by silencing tumor suppressor genes. CpG island shores, 2kb regions around the CpG islands, are also found to be hypermethylated in cancer. Accumulation of very high frequency of DNA methylation at CpG islands has been called CIMP, for CpG Island methylator phenotype, and is associated with a great number of clinicopathological conditions.<br /><br />Methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes strongly to genome stability and thus proper biological operation of the transcriptional and DNA-regulation machinery. Genome-wide hypomethylation, observed in many types of cancer, causes genome instability as well as oncogene activation (at CpG-poor gene promoter sites), contributing to the further development of cancer. In addition to these specific mechanisms, associated with specific types of cancers, the general deregulation leads to accumulation of insulting factors overwhelming the regulatory and tumor suppressive functionality of cells as well as the appearance of long-range epigenetic silencing or activation associated with cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Disruption of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer by producing an overdose of the growth promoting Igf2, which thus acts as an oncogene. It cause fetal and post-natal overgrowth (incl. macroglossia) and predisposes to embryonic/childhood tumors (for example, Wilm's tumor of the kidney), as part of the Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome.<br /><br />The H19/Igf2 cluster contains the Igf2 gene upstream of the ICR, the H19 promotor and distal downstream enhancers. The normal imprinting pattern is for the paternal allele to be methylated at the ICR, with methylation spreading into the H19 promoter, allowing the downstream enhancers to active Igf2; on the maternal allele a CTCF binds to the ICR and acts as an insulating protein, blocking the downstream enhancers from accessing the Igf2 promoter instead promoting of the expression of the lncRNA H19. The mechanism of imprinting action at the H19/Igf2 cluster is one of enhancer blocking. In Wilm's tumor the imprinting is disrupted and the maternal allele acts as the paternal allele, promoting the Igf2 and producing an overdose of the gene product.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the DNA-demethylase class of epigenetic inhibitors, i.e. enzymes which remove methyl marks laid on the DNA. Decitabine thus <strong>reduces</strong> the extent of DNA methylation. Since cancer is associated with hypermethylation of CpG islands and thus silencing of the tumor suppressor genes, Decitabine can be used to reverse the hypermethylation and re-activate the tumor suppressor machinery of the cells.<strong></strong></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Cancer is a complex process in which multiple genetic and epigenetic factors are disrupted leading to general deregulation of biological function and carcinogenesis. Many of the individual insults that in combination cause cancer often happen separately and are contained by the cell-cycle and gene expression regulation machinery. A large combination of insults, aided by environmental pressure and stress, can overwhelm this machinery and go out of control. Drugs altering DNA methylation and histone acetylation can reverse some of these processes, giving the regulatory machinery a chance to regain control. DNA methylation is a stable mitotically heritable mark, so daughter cells, tumor or otherwise, are likely to inherit, and thus perpetuate, the action of the drug. Some of this action may be the increased susceptibility of the cancer cells to induced cell death by chemotherapy.<br /><br />With respect to epigenetics, a sensitive period is when a large number of epigenetic marks are being cleared or laid down, or epigenetic reprogramming. Such periods are pre-implantation development and germ cell development. It is inadvisable for patients to be treated with epigenetic drugs during sensitive periods because the drugs may cause lasting epigenomic disruption and cause numerous immediate or long-term detrimental effects on the organism.</div>
