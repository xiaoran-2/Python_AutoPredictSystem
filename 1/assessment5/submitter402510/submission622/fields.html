    <div class="field-value">Methylation at CpG islands within promoters leads to silencing of the genes that the promotor targets.  Normally, CpG islands are found to be unmethylated.  But in general, as cancer progresses, CpG islands become hypermethylated.  One way disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands directly contributes to cancer is by silencing tumor suppressor genes and growth suppressing genes.  When a CpG island in the promoter for a tumor suppressor gene becomes methylated, this can lead to runaway or uncontrolled growth of the cell's descendants. <br /><br />In contrast, the CpG's found in intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated.  This is thought to promote genetic stability by preventing illegitimate recombination between repeats and preventing activation of repeats &amp; transposition.  In general, as cancer progresses, these CpG's become hypomethylated, which promotes genetic instability and causes abnormal expression of genes.  When these intergenic regions are hypomethylated, they are unwound and form euchromatin when they should be found as heterochromatin.  This causes these regions to be more likely to be expressed and more likely to be recombinated if they encounter regions with similar sequences.  Cryptic promotors can be be more easily activated in these hypomethylated regions, causing abnormal behavior.  When the repeats are hypomethylated, they are more likely to be activated and can be transposed, causing mutations and aberrant behavior.  This behavior and these mutations promote cancer.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprinting of ICR's usually causes conditional behavior specific to each chromosome.  Normally, one pattern of gene expression is observed in the paternal chromosome and another pattern of gene expression is found in the maternal chromosome.  When both chromosomes exhibit the same behavior for an ICR, this can cause overexpression and underexpression of genes.<br /><br />In the H19/lgf2 cluster, the ICR is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele.  When the ICR is unmethylated, the CTCF insulator will bind, causing the upstream enhancers to be applied to H19, resulting in expression of H19.  When the ICR is methylated on the paternal allele, the enhancers are instead applied to the growth factor Igf2, resulting in its expression.<br /><br />When the ICR is methylated on both alleles, this results in overexpression of Igf2, which is found in Wilm's tumour.  This double dose of Igf2 causes excess growth and contributes to Wilm's tumour in juvenile kidney cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitibine is a DNMTi, which inhibits the action of DNA Methyltransferase.  It's a nucleoside analogue, which is incorporated into DNA on replication.  When DNMT1 binds to decitibine, DNMT1 is irreversibly inhibited.  As more DNMT1 is inhibited, less of the methylation marks can be maintained during replication.  Therefore, this drug causes hypomethylation of DNA.<br /><br />Because this drug's action is tied to replication and because cancer cells undergo replication much more often, this means decitibine will have a greater hypomethylation effect in cancerous cells.  For cancers caused by hypermethylation of CpG islands, the cancer could be treated by demethylating those regions.  By demethylating CpG islands, this can restore the expression of genes like tumor suppressors.  Decitibine is approved for the treatment of MDS.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is passed to the cell's descendants, so any alterations are also passed on to daughter cells.  If a cancer is caused by a combination of several hypermethylated CpG islands, then if you are able to correct the methylation in one or more of those CpG islands, those benefits will be passed on to the cell's descendants.  This means that those descendant cells will exhibit fewer of the causes of excess growth.  So chemotherapy may be more effective, even after the patient is no longer administered epigenetic drugs. <br /><br />These drugs work by reprogramming epigenetic mechanisms and those changes are passed on to descendant cells.  Therefore, these drugs should be avoided during sensitive periods of development.  This is because any changes to the epigenome before and especially during sensitive periods of development are more likely to cause downstream problems.  That is, if safe epigenetic changes depend on the state of the epigenome, then widespread &amp; unexpected changes to that epigenomic state would likely cause many problems downstream.<br /><br />Sensitive periods are periods of extensive epigenetic programming.  These include early childhood, puberty and especially periods during pregnancy, such as germ line development, which can affect subsequent generations.  <br /><br /><br /></div>
