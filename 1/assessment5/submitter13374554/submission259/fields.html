    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer in the paternal allele the ICR is methylated and CTCF
cannot bind, the enhancers can influence lgf2 expression (igf2 is
expressed). The paternal allele in normal cells is the same.</p><p>In normal cells in the maternal allele the ICR has an unmethylated status.
CTCF binds to the ICR, the enhancers cannot influence the expression of
Igf2, so it is not expressed. In cancer the ICR is methylated, enhancers influence the Igf2 expression and it is expressed from the maternal
allele.  </p><p>In general the hypomethylation of ICRs leads to loss of imprinting.
Alterations in DNA methylation (hypo- or hypermethylation) result in
overexpression of growth promoting genes. In Wilm’s tumour -
hypermethylation of the ICR and overexpression of Igf2 from the H19/Igf2
cluster.<b></b></p><p>Cancer cells display loss of imprinting – genes that should have monoallelic
expression are silent in both copies or express both the parental alleles. The
abnormalities in DNA methylation can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes
and overexpression of
growth promoting genes. Disrupting the imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster
contributes to cancer as when the ICR is hypermethylated this results in the
overexpression of Igf2 from the cluster which causes so-called Wilm’s tumour
(kidney tumour).</p><p>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells CpG islands tend to be protected from methylation i.e.
they are unmethylated. Most of the CpG islands retain unmethylated status, but
there are a small subset that are dynamically methylated between cell types.</p><p>In cancer cells the CpG islands are hypermethylated, while the other parts
of the genome that have to be methylated are actually unmethylated. This event
occurs frequently in tumours. In cancer DNA methylation is an alternative to
silence tumour suppressor genes.</p><p>DNA methylation contributes to cancer as in cancer cells there is
genome-wide hypomethylation and also tumour suppressor genes are
hypermethylated. The role of DNA methylation can be different depending on the
context – it can either suppress or enhance tumourogenesis.</p><p>DNA
methylation at intergenic regions has a role in silencing gene expression (a
cryptic promoter is silenced). The normal function of DNA methylation is to
maintain genomic stability (studies show genomic instability in DNMT1 null
cells). The function of DNA methylation at repetitive elements is also to
maintain genomic stability. The repeats are silenced or mutated (5-methyl
cytosine converts to thymine and this is mutagenic) and this is to prevent
transposition. Silencing of repeats also leads to avoiding transcriptional
interference from strong promoters. Methylation of repeats may prevent
illegitimate recombinations.</p><p>In cancer
cells the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements are hypomethylated.
This can lead to illegitimate recombinations
between repeats which causes genomic instability. The repeats can also be activated due to hypomethylation
– they are able to jump around the genome or transpose which may cause
disruption of genes or activation of neighbouring genes.</p><p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent which belongs to the class of DNMTi
(DNA methyltransferase inhibitors). This is a drug that’s targeting the
epigenetic machinery. It’s approved for using in MDS that progresses to acute
myeloid leukemia (AML). </p>

<p><span>After DNA methyltransferases are binded to the DNA, Decitabine acts on
them. This is happening during cell division, so it is cell division dependent. Lower doses of Decitabine (DNMT inhibitor) cause DNA demethylation. At higher doses is it toxic and uneffective<b>. </b></span></p>

<p>In cancer cells we can see methylation more often than in normal cells.
Decitabine causes DNA demethylation and it can have anti-tumour effect. While
the cell is dividing DNA methylation is happening because it is mitotically
heritable and Decitabine binds to the DNMTs, blocks the methylation and
therefore prevents tumourogenesis. Cancer cells divide more rapidly and
methylation occurs more frequently so via Decitabine we can prevent formation
of tumours.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic marks are laid down and have to be erased before cell
division so that the new generation has totipotency. Epigenetic marks are laid down again. DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and the next generation of cells
will have the same DNA methylation profile. By influencing DNA methylation, we
influence the epigenome of the cell which is passed onto the next generation. </p>

<p>Sensitive periods are are periods of the development of an organism when changes
in the environment can have the biggest effect on the epigenome. Mitotic heritability is required, otherwise
they only affect the cells exposed to this environmental
influence and are lost when the cells divide.</p>

<p>There are 2 sensitive periods of development – germ cell development and
early development (preimplantation period). In these periods it’s occurring generalized
reprogramming between generations – to wipe off the marks that are being laid
down in one life time in somatic cells - this ensures totipotency of the next
generation.</p>

<p>Treating patients with drugs during sensitive periods is inadvisable, because in these periods it’s occurring reprogramming which is very important
for the normal development of all cells. If epigenetic reprogramming goes
wrong, this can result in different abnormalities of the cells.</p></div>
