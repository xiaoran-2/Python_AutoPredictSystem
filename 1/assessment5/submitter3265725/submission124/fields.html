    <div class="field-value"><div>DNA methylation is essential for normal cell development, it's a mitiotically heritable epigenetic mark through enzymes like DNMT1 that establish these marks in cell division on the daughter strand according to the paternal strand. DNA methylation leads to silencing of the gene, and in turn hypomethylation leads to activation.</div><div>It occurs on cytosine, and this mainly happens in CpG islands, which are CG repeats on the DNA sequences, takes place mainly on promotors of genes.</div><div>Generally, CpG islands tend to be hypomethylated in the genome, which allows the expression of genes. </div><div><br /></div><div>Cancer is a disease of abnormal cell growth, thus favors silencing of tumor suppressor genes and activating oncogenes.</div><div>In cancer, there is evident hypermethylation of CpG islands that helps in establishing cancer. As CpG islands are mostly found on the promotors of genes, so when hypermethylated they are silenced, and we find silencing of the promotors of tumor suppressor genes in cancer. </div><div><br /></div><div>A lot of our DNA is noncoding, and when it happens in high number we call it repetitive element. Some of them are transposons that copy or cut and paste themselves in another place which can disrupt the DNA, which cause genomic instability including deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations.<br />so they tend to be normally hypermethylated to prevent transposition, and activating strong promtors by transcriptional interference, and as they are so many of those repetitive elements, there is a chance of illegitimate recombination between them which is also prevented by hypermethylation.<br /><br />Intergenic regions are parts of DNA located between the genes and is noncoding, they are normally hypermethylated to prevent genomic instability, through silencing cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites.<br /><br /></div><div>As it is known, Genomic instability is a hallmark of cancer, so cancer tend to hypomethylate those repetitive elements and intergenic regions to activate them. </div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprinting genes are genes that are mono-allelic expressed from specific maternal or paternal origin, so we have one source of these genes.<br /><br />One example of them is H19/Igf2 cluster on chromosome 11, where we find the Imprinting Control Region (ICR) on the maternal allele is hypomethylated, which allows its binding to CTCF, an insulator protein, that insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers and making them expressing H19 intead of Igf2, whereas on the paternal allele the ICR is hypermethylated and this methylation spreads to H19 as in heterochromatin spreading which inhibits the binding of CTCF and make the enhancers express Igf2 instead of H19.<br /><br />Igf2 is an oncogene which promots growth, that's why it's overexpressed in cancer, so we get hypermethylation of the ICR on the maternal allele which inhibits the binding of CTCF and direct the enhancers toward Igf2 expression, so we get a double dose of the oncogene which promotes cancer and we lose the imprinting.<br /><br />We can find this abnormality in DNA methylation in wilm's tumor, which is a tumor of children in the kidneys, where both ICR on the paternal and maternal allele are hypermethylated and Igf2 is double expressed, and it's an early event in tumorogenesis.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is an anti-neoplastic drug that target the epigenetic machinery, used for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes, which is the precursor of acute myelogenous leukaemia. It belongs to DNA-demethylating agents, that work to reduce DNA methylation on tumor suppressor genes and reactivate them, and this can lead the cancer cell to commit suicide and induce apoptosis, which fights cancer.<br />It's a cytidine analogue, so it can incorporate in the DNA, and when DNA methyltransferase comes to add methyl groups on cytosine, it attaches to decitabine irreversibly through a covalent bond, which stops its action and reduces methylation that cause repression of the tumor suppressor genes. So it's dependent on its intracellular conversion to its 5'-triphosphate metabolite.<br /><br />External source:  <a href="http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01262">http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01262</a></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is a mitotically heritable epigenetic mark through enzymes like DNMT1 which methylates the daughter strand of a hemi-methylated DNA during cell devision according to the paternal strand, which maintains this mark through the cell line for a lifetime unless this mark is actively removed.<br /><br />Sensetive periods are when reprogramming of the epigenome occurs to restore totipotency, which takes place in the formation of primordial germ cells, where all the paternal and maternal genomes are cleared and reset as well as the imprinted genes, and this allows the specific differentiation into either a sperm or an egg, whereas the repeats IAP are not cleared for safety reasons so they don't disturb the genome.<br /><br />The second period is during early developmental stage where blastocyst formation occurs, so clearing of the specific marks of sperms and eggs, and pluripotency marks show up, all the previous steps occur except for the imprinting genes where they remain untouched to preserve the original imprintng.<br /><br />Any disruption to the epigenome in these periods will cause effects, like imprinting disorders, that last for a lifetime, it's the most vulnerable period for environmental changes, so it's inadvisable to treat patients because of bad effects on germ cells.</div>
