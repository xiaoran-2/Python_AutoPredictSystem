    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal genome, CpG islands are
hypomethylated; you generally don't see methylation there. Hassler
and Egger note that these islands are found in 60% of promoters and
are heavily involved in transcription initiation. Methylation of a
CpG island has the effect of silencing the underlying gene (which is
often a tumor suppressing gene). In cancer cells CpG islands become
hypermethylated in a locus specific way, i.e. The specific islands or
sets of islands that become hypermethylated differ by tumor type
[lecture 7.2]. We also see hypermethylation of CpG Island shores, 2Kb
upstream or downstream of the CGI. </p><p>Outside of the CpG Islands, the rest of the genome is normally hypermethylated. Quoting Hassler and
Egger again, “the modification of the C5 position of the cytosine base
(5mC) is found in 70-80% of CpG dinucleotides in somatic mammalian
cells”.  In other words, throughout the rest of the genome, which is made up of
intergenic regions, repetitive elements and actual genes, methyl marks are placed on CG and CpG nucleotide sequences so that the associated elements are silenced. But in cancer, these regions lose their
methylation marks and so they are now expressed, and this has various
adverse effects depending on where it happens. Most common is
hypomethylation of repeats, which leads to illegitimate recombination
between repeats including deletions, insertions, and reciprocal
translocations, increasing genomic instability in a progressive way
(i.e. it gets worse over time). This genomic instability can also
lead to activation of nearby genes, as with e.g. the agouti yellow
gene in mice. The other thing that happens in cancer is
Hypomethylation of imprint control regions and of CpG poor promoters,
which can result in the activation of cancer causing genes e.g the
oncogene R-RAS is activated in cancer due to hypomethylation of a CpG
poor promoter.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>To quote from the lectures: “One of
the really common features of cancer cells is they display loss of
imprinting”. Genes that should be expressing only from one parent
of origin allele either express from both alleles (in growth
promoting genes) or are silenced completely (in growth suppressing
genes). This happens because of hypo or hyper methylation at Imprint
Control Regions or ICR's. <br />Consider the example of the H19/Igf2
cluster, which in normal cells is paternally imprinted: on the
paternal allele, DNA methylation at the ICR blocks the binding of an
insulator protein CTCF, which in
turn allows downstream enhancers to promote Igf2 expression. In
contrast the maternal allele is normally unmethylated, which allows
CTCF to bind and this insultaes Igf2 from the downstream enhancers
(which then act on H19 instead) so Igf2 is not expressed. <br />In
Wilm's tumor there is Hypermethylation of the ICR on the H19 cluster,
Which results in CTCF not being able to bind on the maternal allele
and subsequent overexpression of Igf2, which is a growth factor. This
double dose of growth factor is what causes tumors to grow, and in
general loss of imprinting is one of the early factors in
tumorogenesis.

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs in the class of
drugs known as DNA Methyl Transferase inhibitors, or DNMTi's, and
along with Vidaza is US FDA approved. These drugs are used to treat
myelodysplastic syndromes and ACL, and are most effective when used
in very small doses. They are nucleoside analogues ( nucleosides which contain a
nucleic acid analogue and a sugar) and work by being incorporated
into DNA, and then when DNMT comes along to copy the methylation mark
to the daughter strand it instead gets bound irreversibly to the
altered DNA (this means the effectiveness of Decitabine is
replication dependent). Over time this removes methylation marks in
the affected regions. Cancer cells are more severely affected because
they replicate faster. While the mechanism of action is uncertain, it is thought that when this happens at CpG islands it allows cancer suppressing genes to be re-expressed, killing the cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><br />By definition, epigenetic effects
are effects which are mitotically inheritable; whether an epigenetic
drug adds or takes away methylation marks, or modifies a histone,
those changes are inherited by cell division to daughter and then
granddaughter cells and so have enduring effects on the epigenome
after the drug treatment itself has been stopped. We also know that there are periods when it would be inadvisable to administer drugs which can alter the epigenome. For example, epigenetic marks need to be cleared between generations to
restore totipotency; epigenetic reprogramming of the paternal and
maternal genomes occurs during the pre implantation period and
primordial germ cell development period. We call these periods of
development sensitive periods, because the genome is particularly
vulnerable to insults during these times of epigenetic reprogramming.
It would be highly inadvisable to treat patients during these
sensitive periods because of the possible damage to the epigenome of
all the cells in an organism; damage that would thereafter be
inherited mitotically. <br /></p>
