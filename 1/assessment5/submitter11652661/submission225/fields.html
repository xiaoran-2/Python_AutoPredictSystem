    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">As of when the paternal allele is concerned there exist methylation at the ICRs, which doesn't allow CTCF binding, also due to which, instead, H19 is hypermethylated. The direct consequence is the action of enhancers on Igf2 and thereby releasing the growth hormone.<br /><br />Whereas when the maternal allele is concerned, in normal cells, we don't find any methylation of the ICRs, which allow the CTCF to bind with the ICR, thereby not allowing H19 methylation. This further in contrast to the case of paternal allele, allows the action of enhancers on H19, instead of Igf2.<br /><br />Now when we consider loss of imprinting, the hypermethylation of the ICRs at both the alleles, lead to complete hypermethylation of the H19 locus, where we find only the action of enhancers on Igf2. This is the case in that of Wilms tumor, where both the maternal and paternal allele are expressed leading to childhood kidney tumor. <br /><br />Therefore, disrupting the H19/Igf2 cluster, leads to the over growth due to over expression of growth factors, as expressed by the double dose of Igf2 region.<br /><br />This thereby is a direct correlation between loss of imprinting and the onset of cancer, here Wilms tumor taken as an example. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to silence the gene expression,(As seen in video 5 of week 1). <br /><br />In cancer, the DNA methylation at the CpG islands is disrupted as the expression of methyl marks are altered and set opposite to that originally present, to swap the expression. It is just known that the DNA methylation at the CpG island is disrupted, but the exact pathway and mechanism is not known here. <br /><br />Now due to the disruption, the expression of tumor suppressing genes reduces and that the growth factor inducing genes increases. This then leads to the uncontrolled and unstoppable growth of cells from the normal to hyperplasic, then to neoplastic and finally metastatic cells, with increased CpG methylation instead of global level of methylation.<br /><br />The case of intergenic regions and repetitive elements is different than that of the CpG island methylation, where the usual, i.e.; normal cells have hypermethylation in the repetitive element, intergenic regions as well as the intronic regions of the genes. This leads to the normal functioning and the proper working of the genes in the normal cells.<br /><br />But due to the effect of swapping of methylation marks in the normal cells and the cancer cells, both the areas i.e.; the CpG island and the intergenic region+repetitive element+intronic regions, the disruption of function occurs where the genes that needed to be hypermethylated, now becomes hypomethylated, reducing its expression, whereas, the CpG island gets activated and leads to the metastatic expression of the cell.<br /><br />This thereby results in the exactly opposite working and expression of the machinery due to alterations in the epigenetic marks and thus the resulting cancer phenotype. <br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine sold as Dacogen by Eisai, a Japanese company, is a DNA demethylating agent. It is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.<br /><br />The impact of decitabine on DNA methylation can be understood by viewing the video 9 of week 7, where Decitabine had been classified under DNMTis. This means that Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, which thereby inhibits the transfer of methyl groups to the DNA, by that of methyltransferases. By doing so it prevents the onset of MDS or MyeloDysplastic Syndrome which further can lead to the development into AML or Acute Myelo Leukemia, by preventing the methylation at particular histone sites.<br /><br /> As we already know of the methods of work of decitabine, it is not very difficult to predict its demethylating property, where the removal of the epigenetic marks can prevent from the overexpression of tumour cells, thus preventing occurrence of cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">As we know already that the DNA methylation has irreversible effects when occurring in the sensitive periods, we also do understand that the alteration and modifications in the epigenetic marks in the genome also can lead to the irreversible and unnecessary modifications in the epigenome. The expression and silencing of the genes depend upon the DNA methylation epigenetic marks.<br /><br />A sensitive period is one in which any alterations or aberrations in the epigenetic mark, can lead to devastating effects to the individuals and also the generations to come.<br /><br />Some sensitive periods that we know of from week 4 are the time for the haploid germ cell formation, pre implantation period early development and the primordial germ cell development. These two are the sensitive periods of development because there happens the erasing and retyping and reprogramming of epigenetic marks at this time, for which these are very critical periods wherein any changes in the normal pattern of epigenetic machinery shall lead to irreparable changes for the fetus as well as the progeny.<br /><br />Treating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable just to prevent any unwanted and unforeseen modifications or aberrations in the epigenetic makeup of the concerned patient or further the progeny.<br /></div>
