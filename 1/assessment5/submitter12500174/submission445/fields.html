    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value">Generally, in normal cells, CpG islands are protected from methylation, that is, they are hypomethylated. On the other hand, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually hypermethylated. In cancer cells, the opposite is mostly true: CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated, whereas intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated.<br />Hypermethylated CpG islands in cancer cells are commonly found in the promoters of tumour supressor genes. Therefore, this CpG island hypermethylation, which is mitotically heritable, results in silencing of tumour supressor genes (these genes are locked in a silent inactive state). Besides that, this epimutation can be rapidly selected for. The cells then divide more rapidly and take over, growing into a tumour.<br />Hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements leads to genomic instability, through illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, and activaction of cryptic promotors and disruption of neighbouring genes. Thus, in cancer cells, there are copying errors such as deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations in the chromossomes.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">On the paternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster the Imprint Control Region (ICR) is methylated, while on the maternal allele is unmethylated. When this ICR is unmethylated, the binding of CTCF is promoted and the downstream enhancers act on the H19 gene, which is expressed. The Igf2<i> </i>gene is silent, so there's no expression of this gene from the maternal allele. On the paternal allele, because the ICR is methylated, CTCF isn't allowed to bind and the enhancers can act on Igf2. Igf2 is then expressed from the paternal allele.<br />In Wilm's tumour, the ICR is methylated on the maternal allele as well; therefore, there's expression of Igf2 from the two alleles - the dose of Igf2 is twice the dose found in normal cells. Igf2 is growth promoting, so a high dose of this factor may stimulate the growth of tumor cells and prevent damaged cells from being destroyed.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors and is a nucleoside analogue. It is incorporated into the DNA upon replication, and when the DNA methyltransferase comes along to bind a nucleotide to then copy the methylation to the daughter strand, that DNA methyltransferase is bound irreversibly and it can no longer be released. In this fashion, it contributes to DNA hypomethylation, which leads to reactivation of epigenetically silenced tumour supressor genes. The action of Decitabine is division dependent, so the cell has to be replicating. Consequently, cancer cells, which are dividing much more rapidly than most other cells, will be more severely affected because they're replicating more.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation alterations, as a result of the action of specific drugs, are passed on during cell 
division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively 
erased. This clearing of epigenetic marks occurs during certain periods of development - primordial germ cell development and pre-implantation period - and so treating patients during these critical periods of extensive epigenetic reprogramming is inadvisable, particularly in the case of pregnant women, as a lot of reprogramming happens in early child development as well as during the formation of gametes.<br /></div>
