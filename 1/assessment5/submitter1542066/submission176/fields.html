    <div class="field-value">The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to repress the gene that is upstream of the island.  Most CpG islands in a normal epigenome are not methylated, leaving the gene open for transcription.  In cancer, specific tumor suppressor genes that have CpG islands become hypermethylated shutting down the gene that follows.  Since the gene is a tumor suppressor gene, it can contribute to tumorigenesis in that those cells will divide more quickly and become the dominant cell type.<br /> Normally there is methylation of CG dinucleotides in the intergenic region and repetitive elements.  The methylation at repetitive elements helps to lock down these areas so they aren't transcribed. When  Repetitive elements are transcribed, they can combine at the wrong places causing translocations, substitutions, and deletions.   These types of mutations can become another hit genetically that can contribute to tumorigenesis.  Knudsons hypothesis is that it takes more than one mutation or epigenetic hit to cause cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"> IgF2 is a growth gene.  The paternal allele of the IgF2 imprinted control region is methylated in a normally imprinted genome.    There are some downstream enhancers that loop over and are able to transcribe the Igf2 over the imprint control region.  In contrast the maternal allele is un-methylated  in the normally imprinted ICR. Tthe CTCF protein can bind with the imprint control region.  This protein binding blocks the downstream enahncers access to the IgF2 gene and instead H19 is transcribed which has nothing to do with cell growth.  UPstream of the IgF2 ICR is the Cdkn1c gene which is a tumor suppressor gene.  The ICR for that gene is methylated on the maternal allele, but the tumor suppressor gene gets expressed from the maternal allele. In cancer, imprinting is lost.  The ICR on the paternal allele is a CpG island so it stays hyper methylated.  Both allele behave like the paternal allele and growth is enhanced.  Cdkn1c is not a CpG island and methylation is lost, the tumor suppressor gene does not get expressed and a tumor is born.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor.  This drug is a nucleoside analog and when DNMT1 comes along to copy the methyl mark to a daughter strand, it binds irreversibly and so it cannot detach and attach other methyl marks.  Methylation is important when tumor suppressor genes are locked down with methylation on CpG islands. In time, this would dilute out the methylation at these locations when the cells are actively dividing.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA de-methylators work by irreversibly attaching to the daughter strand as the DNMT1 attaches to copy the methyl mark.  This helps reverse the epigenetic errors that happen by diluting out the methylation mistakes as the cells are dividing.  By definition it would target only those cells that are actively dividing.  Tumor cells divide out of control but normal cells also divide in order to replace cells that have died or are no longer functioning.  <br />A sensitive period is one in which the patient has cleared the epigenome and is in the process of laying down marks anew.  These two time periods is early embryonic development and later gestation when the primordial germ cells are forming.<br />  A younger child is  vulnerable in terms of the maturing of their primordial germ cells since the imprinting of mono allelic gene expression is an ongoing process through childhood.    Another sensitive  period in a patient would be of a pregnant mother whose child is just laying down these marks and/ or the child's primordial germ cells both while in utero and while they are still maturing.  So treating someone while pregnant or a child is not advisable.</div>
