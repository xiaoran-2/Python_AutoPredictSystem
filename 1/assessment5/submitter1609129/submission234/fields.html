<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;">DNA methylation is an expression silencing epigenetic mark where
methyl<span>  </span>group added to cytosine residues
of cytosine<span>  </span>followed by guanine
dinucleotide (CpGs). Through specific regions<span> 
</span>of the genome especially up stream to the transcription start site of a
gene<span>  </span>there are high frequencies of
these<span>  </span>(CpG) which called CpG islands. In
normal cells these islands tend to be un or hypomethylated and that is a signal
for gene expression. However, in cancer cells the reverse tend to be happened
and <span> </span>hypermethylation<span>  </span>at CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes
enhance tumorgenesis<span>  </span>by silencing these
genes which inhibit cancer growth. On the other hand, hypomethylation of
CpGs<span>  </span>tend to be occur at intergenic and
repetitive elements regions of the genome of normal cells and that lead to
silence the expression of DNA jumping elements<span> 
</span>called transposons from these regions and that protect normal cells from
genetic mutation, abnormal chromosomal recombination and genomic instability
that happen by the expression of<span>  </span>theses
elements in cancer cells that show<span> 
</span>globally abnormal hypomethylation<span> 
</span>at<span>  </span>these regions.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine also known as 
5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine is a DNA methylation inhibitor. It hypomethylates
DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase one (DNMT1) because decitabine is a
nucleotide - building blocks of DNA- analogue, it can incorporate in the new
synthesized DNA strand during cell replication and when DNMT1 methylate this
strand it bound to that strand permanently and couldn't function again.
Decitabine is indicated as a drug for the treatment of cancer especially in
myelodysplastic syndromes</span> <span>(MDS) because it slows down these tumor growth .Also,
cancer cells highly divide and replicate it's DNA so it seems the most affected
cells by </span>decitabine effects neither surrounding normal
ones. However, the real mechanism of decitabine to inhibit caner growth didn't
discovered until now.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetics marks like DNA methylation are heritable along cell
divisions of normal cells  this  also true for cancer cells where epigenetics
alterations are seen to be inherited during cancer cell divisions because of
epigenetic memory. Logically, during treating cancer cells with drugs altering
the DNA methylation patterns these alterations will be inherited from treated
cells to it's daughter ones. On the other hand, during our development there
are two sensitive periods 
pre-implantation period during embryogenesis and germ cell development
period during gametogenesis (formation of gametes)  where epigenetic machinery erase old
epigenetics marks and lay down new ones this process are very sensitive for
external factors like diet, drugs, environment and for internal factors like
transcription factors. Treating some subset of patients like pregnant women
or  any adult men able to have children
with epigenetics drugs during these sensitive periods will be inadvisable after
treatment because the epigenetics alterations produced by these drugs seems to
be  inherited to the next generations
during pregnancy or by altered gametes.  </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;">We inherited two copies (alleles) of each gene one copy from father
and the other from mother. For most of our genes the two alleles are expressed,
but some genes like that found in H19/Igf2 cluster show mono allelic expression
depend on the origin of the inherited allele (maternal or paternal) therefore
it called imprinted genes. The control of expression of these genes is occur
by<span>  </span>DNA methylation at imprint control
regions (ICRs). At H19/Igf2 cluster, (ICR) was methylated in the paternal allele
only and that block the binding of insulator protein that insulates Igf2 from
downstream expression enhancers causing paternal expression of Igf2 growth
promoting gene. However, in the maternal allele the reverse happened at
(ICR)<span>  </span>and that cause downstream
enhancers to bind to H19 gene instead of Igf2 causing maternal expression of
growth restricting H19 gene. In Wilm’s tumour hypermethylation at (ICR) of
H19/Igf2 cluster<span>  </span>occur in both parental
alleles (loss of imprinting)<span>  </span>causing
over expression of Igf2 gene. The overexpression of growth promoting Igf2 gene
and loss of expression of growth restricting H19 gene enhances the over all
uncontrolled growth of cancer cells.</span></p>
