    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">1: normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands are  meCpG in a CpG island is associated with the formation of a repressive chromatin structure (1o mechanism)  meCpG can prohibit transcription factor binding, and alter gene expression (2o mechanism)<br /><br />2: DNA methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer either by hypo or hypermethylation<br /><br />3:  hyper methylation can silence tumour suppressor genes in cancer and hypo can activate oncogene<br /><br />4: DNA methylation in intergenic regions can regulate gene expression and in repetitive elements can prevent chromosomal instability <br /><br />5:DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer may be via absence of DNMT enzyme<br /><br />6:DNA methylation in intergenic regions can suppress Tumor suppressor gene or activate oncogene  and in repetitive elements can cause chromosomal instability .</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">1: if there is paternal imprinting in both allele&gt;&gt;&gt; the igf2 will be doubled in expression. if maternal imprinting occurs it would increase H19 expression(double)<br />2: in maternal allele there is methylation in ICR which conveys CTCF(insulator protein) so no expression of IGF2 from it<br />3:in wilm's tumor  maternal allele  is unmethylated in ICR which conveys CTCF(insulator protein) not to bind so over expression of IGF2 and absence of H19<br />4: excess IGF2 will cause tumor overgrowth<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">1: DNA-demethylating agents<br /><br />2: it inhibits DNA methylation<br />3: it may have epigenetic control via expressing tumor suppressor<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">1:DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the        epigenome as it can be mitotically heritable so it extends beyond the treatment periods.<br /><br />2: sensitive period means the time of epigenetic reprogramming.<br /><br />3: a. early development b. primordial germ cell development are the sensitive periods<br />4: in sensitive periods epigenetic reprogramming occurs actively so in these period drugs can make gene unstable by exclussively demethylating them.<br /></div>
