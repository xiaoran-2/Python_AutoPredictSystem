    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA can be methylated at CpG islands for many reasons: ensure genome
stability, silence gene expression...but tumour cells have an altered
epigenome. In normal cells we usually find locus specific DNA hypomethylation and genome-wide DNA hypermethylation, whereas in cancer we find locus specific DNA hypermethylation and genome-wide DNA hypomethylation.</p><p>CpG islands are often in gene promoters, and they tend to be protected from methylation. When a specific type of cell needs to silence a gene, it uses methylation in this gene, because methylation lead to silencing by two mechanisms: methylation is associated with the formation of a repressive chromatin structure and methylation can prohibit transcription factor binding.<br />In cancer, genes tend to be methylated, so many important genes as tumour suppressor genes can´t be expressed.</p><p>The function of DNA methylation at intergenic regions is maintaining genome stability (avoiding deletions, translocations, insertions and duplications), and in repetitive elements it also has the function of maintaining genome stability (preventing transposition and illegitimate recombination).<br />In cancer these two areas are hypomethylated, so its DNA is more unstable. Hypomethylation of repeats and intergenic intervals result in illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition (which can silence other genes if they "jump" into the coding region or the promoter of other gene) and the activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes.</p><p>One of the most important things of DNA methylation is that it is context dependent: depletion of DNA methylation can enhance tumorigenesis by chromosomal instability, but it can also suppress tumorigenesis if the hypomethylated area is a tumour suppressor promoter.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">H19/Igf2 cluster is composed by the next areas: the Igf2 area, the CTCF binding area the H19 area and the enhancers.<br />The paternal allele used to be hypermethylated at ICR (Imprinting Control Region), so CTCF (the insulator) cannot bind the DNA and the enhancers stimulate Igf2 expression.<br />The maternal allele used to be unmethylated at ICR, so CTCF binds the DNA without problems, and the enhancers cannot stimulate Igf2 expression, so H19 is enhanced by them.<br /><br />In Wilm´s tumour the ICR in this cluster is hypermethylated, so both alleles act like the normal paternal allele, producing overexpression of Igf2. Igf2 is growth promoter, so it can lead to cancer development. Igf2 can also stimulate vascular development (so it participates in angiogenesis through its ability to upregulate other genes), and with these new blood vessels the tumours can grow.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNMTi (DNMT inhibitor). It is a modified nucleoside, very similar to normal nucleosides but with an amino group in the methylation site, so they cannot be methylated when they are incorporated in DNA strands. This is the reason why they block DNMT1, because DNMT1 cannot preserve the methylation pattern in the new strands of dividing cells (as tumour cells).<br />This is how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect, because when the tumour cells divide fast they have to replicate their DNA, and in the replication this drug is incorporated in DNA strands, so these new cells cannot be methylated by DNMT1 and many genes that were silenced in cancer can be expressed now (like apoptotic proteins or tumour suppressor genes), making the tumours more susceptible to die and slowing down their proliferation.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Before using an epigenetic drug you have to analyse the pros and cons of using it, because in many cases it is a good idea because epigenetic drugs improve patient´s life, but in other cases using these drugs can be a bad decision. <br /><br />When you alter the epigenome of a new cells that is being formed in your body, the epigenome of this cell and its "offspring" would be changed forever. When you are an adult not all cells divide, but there are sensitive periods when consuming these epigenetic drugs can have fatal consequences. <br />These sensitive periods are when epigenetic reprogramming is occurring, because you can lose imprinting and you can be epigenetically altered forever (what leads to diseases and premature death). These sensitive periods occur in germ cell development (gametogenesis) and in early development (from the fertilised egg to the blastocyst), but childhood is also a sensitive period because they are more sensitive to these epigenetic changes than adults.<br /><br />Treating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable because you can deteriorate his life forever.</div>
