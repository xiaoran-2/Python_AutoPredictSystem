    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are groups of CG diucleotides, and methylation occurs by addition of a methyl group to the 5 Carbon by DNMT 3A and 3B enzymes. These islands are found upstream of promoters of genes, and are normally not methylated. Methylation leads to silencing of the genes associated with the CpG islands, by binding of MeCP proteins which condense the chromatin or by binding of proteins that interfere with transcription.<br />In cancers, there is increased likelihood of methylation of CpG islands, and this is mitotically heritable.These cells are better able to reproduce and survive and are rapidly selected for, thus contributing to the neoplasia.The genes that are normally silenced in these situations are the tumour suppressor genes. These are normally active only in growth situations and are then kept silent, unless activated in cancers. <br />In normal cells there is genome wide DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements, but there is DNA hypomethylation in these regions in the cancer cell. There is progression in time, increasing tumorigenicity. The consequences depend on location - eg. it is common in repeats, and in CpG poor promoters - this leads to oncogene activation. DNA methylation in these regions promotes genomic stability - thus hypomethylation reads to illegitimate combinations between repeats, activation of repeats and transpositions, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes. There are more deletions, insertions, reciprocal translocations. DNA methylation is context dependant and different tumours have different dependencies. It the tumour is driven by hypermethylation of tumour suppressive genes, depletion of methylation will suppress tumorigenesis. It the tumour is driven by chromosomal instability, depletion of DNA methylation will increase the tumorigenesis. It is a hallmark of all tumours that there is genome wide hypomethylation. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In case of the H19/Igf2 cluster of imprinted genes, the Imprint control region(ICR) is situated between H19 and Igf2 clusters. This ICR region is paternally imprinted , i.e. it is methylated in the paternal allele, which prevents binding of the CTCF insulator protein, which allows the DNA methylation to spread downstream to the CpG islands on the H19 promotor, silencing expression of the long non-coding RNA. Thus, the enhancers which lie beyond can access the Igf2 upstream and enhance expression of this oncogene. In the maternal allele, the ICR is not methylated, so the CTCF protein can bind, insulating the Igf2 from the effect of the enhancers which lie downstream. Thus there is increased expression of H19. In Wilm's tumour, there is either a mutation causing the maternal allele to behave like the paternal allele, or uniparental paternal disomy, or epigenetic disruption ( Beckwith Wiederman syndrome). The disruption of this area of chromosome 11 including the H19/Igf2 cluster, and the nearby Kncq1 cluster leads to increased oncogene expression and decreased expression of the tumour suppressor genes from the latter. This effectively causes tumorigenesis and there is increased incidence of childhood Wilm's tumour.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyl transferase inhibitor. It is a nucleoside analogue, and irreversibly binds DNMT 1 after it gets incorporated into the DNA strand during cell replication, and the DNMT1 enzyme binds to the daughter strand to lay down the methylation epigenetic marks. Their action is replication dependant, so cancer cells which are rapidly dividing are more affected. The drug is used in low doses where it increases the DNA methylation, and this is useful in AML which is dependent on tumour suppressor gene hypermethylation. The specific mechanism of action is not known, and they may have other effects, probably on all dividing cells, but at current doses are very effective in haematological malignancies in older patients, with tolerable side effects.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, and is also reversible. The epigenetic changes are passed down to daughter cells till they are actively erased, and once erased, they do not return. <br />A sensitive period is a period during mammalian development when the environment is likely to have a big effect on the epigenome. There are two major sensitive period of development - during primordial germ cell development extending upto the development of mature oocyte and sperm, and during early and preimplantation development of the embryo - which is the time that there is clearance of epigenetic marks and resetting of these in what is known as epigenetic reprogramming. Different organs have sligthly less important sensitive periods depending on their pattern of development. During pregancy, a change in the maternal environment may affect not only the developing fetus, but also the developing germ cells in that fetus, potentially affecting the next generation.<br />Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because of the possible longterm effects on the epigenome, changes in which are mitotically heritable and may potentially affect future generations, fertility etc.Using drugs which inhibit the epigenetic machinery at these times, could have unintended consequences, which may be far-reaching.</div>
