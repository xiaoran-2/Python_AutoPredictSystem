    <div class="field-value">CpG islands tend not to be normally methylated since they are often associated with promoters for the genes. If the islands of a normal cell are methylated it silences the gene(s) and perhaps the chromosome in X-inactivation.<br /><br />In cancer cells the CpG islands are hypermethylated which results in the silencing of the gene(s). This hypermethylation can lead to cancer if the genes affected / silenced are tumor suppressor genes.  DNA methylation is one of the "hits" in the two-hit hypothesis of cancer.  If the tumor suppressor genes aren't expressed (due to methylation) then they cannot do their job of halting the cell cycle when damage is detected. This allows the "mistakes" to be propagated and cancer can be a result.<br /><br />DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements helps to maintain genomic integrity / stability in normal cells.  The methylation in intergenic regions can silence cryptic start sites; in repetitive elements repeats are silenced to prevent transposition and to eliminate interference from strong promoters of other genes.<br /><br />In cancer cells DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is lower than normal, meaning there is hypomethylation. This hypomethylation can result in repeats recombining in unfavorable ways, cryptic promoters being activated and disrupting neighboring genes and more. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Paternal allele -- The imprinted control region is hypermethylated, blocking the CTCF from binding. This allows the methylation to spread to <em>H19</em> promoter. With <em>H19</em> silenced the enhancers will activate <em>Igf2, </em>promoting growth. <br /><br />Maternal allele - The imprinted control region is not methylated so CTCF can bind to it, insulating<em> Igf2</em> from the enhancers that are downstream. This happens because the enhancers will promote <em>H19</em> expression instead.  There will not be expression of <em>Igf2 </em>from this allele. <br /><br />In Wilm's tumor there is hypermethylation of the ICR on the maternal allele as well, resulting in expression of Igf2.  This disruption contributes to cancer because the cell is getting a double dose of the Igf2 protein which is growth promoting.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNMTi or DNA methyltransferase inhibitor.  It is a nucleoside analog and will be incorporated into the DNA during replication. When DNMT comes along to transfer the epigenetic marks from the parent strand, DNMT binds to decitabine, thereby interfering with methylation.  If the gene was being hypermethylated as part of the cancer it was silenced. Treatment with decitabine would prevent the silencing, allowing normal expression of the affected gene(s).<br /><br />Decitabine is thought to target the hypermethylated CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes.  If these tumor suppressor genes are hypermethylated then they are silenced and cannot control progress through the cell cycle. By preventing the methylation from being passed to the next generation of cells the tumor suppressor genes are expressed and the cell cycle is halted when necessary, preventing the formation of a tumor.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the genome in two ways.  If the methylation occurs and is then inherited, the silenced genes will be "passed down."  If the methylation is removed from something like the repetitive elements then major changes can occur in the genome that can be inherited as well.  <br /><br />A sensitive period is when the genome is most vulnerable, ie a period in which a genomic change in one cell can be spread throughout that organism or even another generation. The sensitive periods in development are during early embryonic development when the cells are rapidly dividing and all are clones and also during germ cell development when the gametes for the next generation are being formed. These are periods when the epigenome is being reprogrammed so any alterations will be inherited. <br /><br />Since some cancer treatments can alter the epigenomic marks of the patient treatment during a sensitive period could reprogram the epigenome in unintended ways. If the drug silences a proto-oncogene that had become overactive and the marks were inherited the offspring cells would not respond normally to cell cycle signals.<br /> </div>
