    <h1>Submission 418 from Anon (session_user_id: a3e7a1f080f8c9a9ecc0b4c5881672545a2cb9c1)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to DNA methyl transferase inhibitors .Decitabine is nuclear analogue use to treat Myelodysplastic syndrome which progress to AML,get incorporated in to the Dna upon replication when dnamethyltransferase comes along to bind that nucleotide to then copy the methylation to the daughter strand that Dna methyl transferase is bound irreversibly and it can no longer be released.<br />the action of DNMTinhibitor is division dependent have to have replicating means slows down the growth of rapid cell division by Dna  methylation in cancer cells.<br />small doses of Decitabine drug causing  dna methylation in AML patients  and showing good results  and these patients are very tolerant to DNMT  Inhibiters .</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Dna methylation function is to protect genome .it is additional methyl group on cytosine nucleotide at 5th carbon position mostly cytosine followed by guanine attached with phaspate called CpG Islands normally found around promoters ,DNA methylation is laid down by DNA methylation is transferase in de novo method.dna methylation is stable epigenetic mark for example,calico cats coat colour,x- inactivation  .dna methylation is indication gene silencing to control stable gene expression in different cell types.<br />hyper methylated CpG Islands and global changes  of DNA methylation are  observed in various cancers DNA methylation is mutagenic,DNA methylation depleting is stage specific.epigenetic markers are reversible ,by  using  small molecules inhibiting the action of DNA methylation enzymes  can slowdown cancer or curing the cancer.<br />genomic integrity and stability is normal function of intergenic regions and repetitive elements  by preventing transposons,illegal re combinations .<br />intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypo methylated  in  cancer  conditions for instance,ICF syndrome .duplications,insertions,deletions can be reason for disruptions at cryptic promoters to remove DNA methylation at these regions causing inactivation tumour growth suppressor or other gene promoters which can cause inactivity of tumour growth suppressor gene or activation of cell proliferation.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In paternal allele DNA methylation  occurs so CTCF  cannot insulate ,Igf2 oncogene directly enhanced . In maternal allele CTCF  protien insulates Igf2 expression  which is not methylated .h19/igf2 cluster  on chromosome 11 is  disrupted  by near by kdnh2 cluster which silences the tumour suppressor gene expression causing many global changes in the cluster causing cancer  in. beck worth weiderman's syndrome . CTCF is an insulator protein, insulates Igf2 from downstream
enhancers , DNA methylation at ICR blocks binding of CTCF binding  Without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to
silence and enhancers can access Igf2 to activate .Predisposition to embryonic/ childhood tumours, but not adult tumours
– e.g. Wilm’s tumour (kidney) .Many imprinted genes are involved in growth
Loss of imprinting is a common feature of cancer .<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Dna methylation alterations can cause evading growth suppressors,genome instability and mutation,enabling replicate immortality,activating inversion and metastasis,resisting cell growth,resisting cell death,deregulation cellular energetics.DNA methylation is an alternative to genetic
mutation, to silence tumour suppressor genes
in cancer
• Recognised DNA methylation can be one of the
hits in the Knudson hypothesis (cancer is the result of
multiple hits to DNA)
• Occurs frequently in tumours
– DNA methylation is mitotically heritable
– Epimutations are rapidly selected
• Epimutations are reversible, unlike mutations <br />epigenetic reprogramming stage is sensitive period.Periods of epigenetic reprogramming are sensitive periods <br />germ cell  development and early embryonic development are sensitive periods .<br />germ cell harvesting and embryo handling can disrupt epigenetic reprogramming and Dna  methylation which is observed in culture in these periods which is not advisable to treat patient in sensitive periods.Imprinted genes contribute to growth, especially in placenta
- Somatic nucleus hasn’t been through PGC epigenetic reprogramming, ICR not reset,
and germ cell genome packaging is not achieved
- ICR methylation eroded during early development reprogramming, lack of maternal
effect proteins binding ICRs.</div>
