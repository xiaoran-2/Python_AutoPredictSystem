    <div class="field-value">Methylation of the cytosines in DNA is an important epigenetic mark which helps stabilize the genome and control its transcription. Methylation occurs at CpG islands and at intergenic regions and Repetitive Elements (RE).<b><br />CpG islands</b><br />Methylation of DNA cytosines in CpG islands is usually located in promoters. It is catalyzed by various transferases (DNMTs) and is mitotically heritable. This results in the silencing of the gene(s) under the promoter's control.<br />Methylation in some promoters can allow silencing of tumor suppressor genes. This can contribute a "hit" in the development of cancer as cell growth regulation is diminished. In other cases hypomethylation of promoters can result in the inappropriate activation of oncogenes and tumour development.<br /><b>Intergenic regions and REs</b><br />Methylation of DNA in these regions and elements maintains genomic stability by silencing cryptic "start" and "splice" sites thus minimizing mutations from deletions, insertions and translocation as well as protection against transposons.<br />Global hypomethylation is a feature of cancers and is found particularly in these regions and elements. The consequence of the loss of these methyl groups is disruption of cell function and tumor progression.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprinting of a cell's genome gives the cell (and its descendants) their particular character and ensures they "know their place". Disruption of these epigenetic marks in genes regulating cell replication and growth can lead to  cancer.<br />The <strong>paternal allele</strong> is methylated in the Imprinting Control Region (ICR) and at the <i>H19</i> promoter thus silencing <i>H19 </i>expression. This allows downstream enhancers to activate <i>Igf2 </i>expression. The <strong>maternal allele</strong>, in contrast, is unmethylated in the ICR and the cytosines are bound by the CTCF insulator protein preventing the enhancers accessing <i>Igf2</i>. Thus there is expression of <i>H19</i> but <i>not Igf2.<br /></i>In <strong>Wilm's tumor</strong> there is hypermethylation of both the ICRs and this results in over expression of <i>Igf2</i>.<br />The product of the gene is a growth factor and increased levels of it will promote tumor growth.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue which inhibits cytosine methyl transferases (DNMT) and can alter the epigenome.<br />It is an analogue of cytidine/cytosine and is incorporated into DNA during replication. When the DNMT enzyme binds to this nucleoside it becomes trapped and thus inhibited from carrying out methylation here or elsewhere.<br />At low doses the drug can prevent hypermethylation and this may prevent the silencing of tumor suppressor genes and thus the development of a tumor. (High doses are toxic).</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Methylcytosines in DNA can endure through cell cycles (mitotic heritability) because at replication the DNMT1 methyltransferase adds a methyl to the cytosine in the new CG pair in the daughter strand of DNA.<br />The effect of the alteration of the extent of methylation at DNA sites, once established by a drug, will normally continue in somatic cells as a consequence of this process.<br />During development of the individual there are crucial, sensitive periods when epigenetic marks are being both erased and laid down. These are in utero during pre-implantation development and during primordial germ cell development, and also in the newborn.<br />Treating patients with drugs altering normal epigenetic marks during these sensitive periods is likely to have a serious effect on normal differentiation processes. Therefore treatment of pregnant women and during the neonatal and, possibly, pubertal phases should be avoided.<br /></div>
