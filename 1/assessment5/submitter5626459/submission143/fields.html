    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is altered in cancer in two ways, both of which contribute to the development of cancer. Firstly, DNA is usually hypomethylated at CpG islands but hypermethylated at introns, intergenic regions and repetitive elements (genome-wide). <br /><br />CpG islands are usually found near the start (or promotor) region of genes and hypomethylation of these regions leads to gene expression. A common finding in cancer cells is that CpG islands are hypermethylated. This results in silencing of genes, such as tumour suppressor genes. <br /><br />The other methylation problem in cancer is due to hypomethylation at introns, intergenic regions and repetitive elements in cancerous cells. These regions are usually hypermethylated resulting in genomic stability. However, when these regions are hypomethylated, in euchromatin structure, they are more likely to be susceptible to recombination, repeats and transpositions and activation of cryptic and poor promotors and these alterations could even lead to disruptions to neighbouring genes. Overall, hypomethylation of introns, repetitive elements and intergenic regions leads to genomic instability. <br /><br />To summarize, increased methylation of CpG islands and decreased methylation of repetitive elements, introns and intergenic regions lead to silencing of tumour suppressor genes and genomic instability respectively. Together these may result in the development of cancerous cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Disruption of imprinting can also contribute to cancer development. For example, the H19/Igf2 cluster is differentially methylated in paternal versus maternal genes. The imprint control region (ICR) in the maternal gene is usually not methylated. This leads to the binding of an insulator element to the ICR resulting in enhancer influence on H19 expression and silencing of the Igf2 gene. On the other hand, the ICR is methylated on the paternal allele resulting in enhancer influence on Igf2 expression. However, if this imprinting pattern is disrupted, it can lead to Wilm's tumour. Wilm's tumour is a type of childhood kidney tumour caused by an overexpression of Igf2, which is a growth promoting factor. Overexpression of Igf2 is in the case of Wilm's tumour due to methylation of the ICR on the maternal allele, resulting in no expression of H19 but overexpression of Igf2 via the paternal and maternal allele. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>One of the drugs that may be used to treat cancer is Decitabine. Decitabine is a DNA-methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor (demethylating). DNMT is a nucleoside analogue meaning that it gets incorporated into the DNA during replication. When a strand of DNA is replicated DNMT binds to the daughter strand to methylate regions in a similar manner as in the parent strand. During this replication process, Decitabine irreversibly binds to DNMT after it is incorporated into the newly synthesized daughter strand. Decitabine thereby inhibits DNA methyltransferase leading to reductions in genomic DNA methylation and by doing so removing epigenetic silencing marks resulting in anti-tumour effects such as the reactivation of tumour-suppressor cells.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome. During replication in the cell division process epigenetic changes are passed on to daughter and granddaughter cells, which can lead to irreversible changes in methylation patterns. Treating individuals with epigenetic modificational drugs can be dangerous during sensitive periods where there is increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms. Periods such as these include those of cell division when epigenetic marks are erased and re-established, such as those during early life development and gamete production and maturation. Treating patients during periods of early life development, or women during pregnancy, or during periods of gamete maturation such as puberty, may affect the re-establishment of original DNA methylation patterns. This may then lead to irreversible changes in the epigenome which could affect healthy development.</div></div>
