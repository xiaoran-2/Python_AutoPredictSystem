    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is a mitotically-inheritable epigenetic modification of the base Cytosine that can be found on DNA in CpG sequences and is usually associated with gene repression.<br /><br />In the human genome, dispersed CpGs - which represent ~99% of all CpGs - tend to be methylated. On the contrary, the remaining clusters of CpGs - dense sequences of CpG "islands", typically found near promoters - tend not to be methylated. However, if the islands are methylated, then the genes they are associated with are usually repressed. Meanwhile, the methylation of dispersed CpGs found in intergenic regions and repetitive elements have an important role in suppressing the activity of harmful endogenous retroviruses and transposons that have integrated in those areas.<br /><br />It has been generally observed that in tumorigenesis, the tumour shows a global decrease in dispersed CpG methylation, while a gradual hypermethylation occurs at CpG islands. <br /><br />Hypermethylation of CpG islands can contribute to cancer especially if it occurs at promoters of tumour suppressors, because it switches these genes off. Hypermethylation and eventual suppression of tumour suppressors (TSGs) therefore contributes as a "hit" in Knudson's multiple-hit accumulation hypothesis for cancer, via Loss of Heterozygosity where both TSG alleles must be switched off for it to drive cancer formation. Indeed, cases of hypermethylation have been found in cancer for key TSGs including BRCA1 (breast cancer) and Rb (retinoblastoma).<br /><br />Hypomethylation at dispersed CpGs especially at intergenic regions and repetitive elements happens early on in tumorigenesis and can promote genomic instability - termed an "enabling hallmark" by Weinberg, that can drive cancer. This occurs because hypomethylation and the resulting loosening up of heterochromatin in those regions can activate cryptic promoters, cause illegitimate recombination and cause disruptive transpositions which may increase oncogene and decrease TSG expression.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is a classical example of the battle of the sexes that controls the levels of Igf2 (a growth factor) and H19 (a lncRNA that negatively regulates growth) that can contribute to cancer when disregulated, especially considering that Igf2 is a proto-oncogene.<br /><br />The H19/Igf2 cluster is paternally imprinted at the insulator region between the Igf2 gene and H19 gene. Enhancers downstream of H19 promote Igf2 expression on the paternal chromosome via long-distance interactions. This can occur because the methylated insulator cannot bind CTCF. However, in the maternal chromosome, the hypomethylated insulator region binds CTCF preventing this long-distance interaction. Instead, the enhancers act to promote the more proximal H19 gene, while the Igf2 gene is lowly expressed. This makes sense in the context of the developing embryo: the Dad would contribute towards developing a big baby, while the Mum would want to limit growth lest it strains her fitness during pregnancy.<br /><br />In cancer, hypermethylation of the H19/Igf2 cluster on both chromosomes now enhances Igf2 expression on both the paternal and the maternal chromosomes. This has been characterised to occur in Wilm's kidney tumor where overexpression of Igf2 - now an oncogene - can drive proliferation of the cancer cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue of Cytidine and acts as an irreversible DNMT inhibitor. It is converted to a dNTP and incorporated into replicating DNA during S-phase where dCTP would normally incorporate. If the maintenance DNMT attempted to methylate the incorporated decitabine, it ends up being covalently linked to the base via a Cys residue, and thus inactivated. Therefore, the active enzyme pool is depleted, and hypomethylation results over several cell divisions.<br /><br />Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect if used at a low dose. This low concentration reduces side effects of targeting non-cancer cells on the principle that cancer cells are actively dividing and thus incorporating decitabine in their DNA unlike the majority of somatic cells, and also achieves hypomethylation in the tumour cells. Hypomethylation then reactivates suppressed tumour suppressor genes, killing the cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the adult, DNA methylation is faithfully mitotically inherited at S-phase to daughter DNA strands through the action of the maintenance methylase DNMT1. Drugs that alter the methylome of the cancer cells will therefore have an effect that lasts well beyond its use because the new methylome will be copied to future daughter cells arising from division of the originally drugged cell. It may well be the case that these cells, with a new expression pattern of increased tumour suppressor genes compared to the original cancer cell, are now more susceptible to standard chemotherapy.<br /><br />Bearing this lasting effect in mind, it will be unwise to treat pregnant women and young children with epigenetic inhibitors as these periods of time coincide with sensitive periods of epigenetic reprogramming. These included the first reprogramming wave of demethylation and remethylation at the blastocyst stage, the second demethylation wave when primordial germ cells form, and the remethylation of egg and sperm early in a child's development. DNMT drugs at this stage would adversely affect the methylome of somatic adult cells and can adversely alter the imprinted methylation status of developing germ cells which will have poor effects on expected gene expression patterns.<br /><br /><br /></div>
