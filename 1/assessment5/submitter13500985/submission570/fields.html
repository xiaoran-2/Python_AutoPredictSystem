    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, in a mammalian cell, CpG islands are
hypomethylated. Methylation of CpG islands leads to silencing of gene expression,
and it is mitotically heritable. On the other hand, in cancer cells, CpG
islands are hypermethylated, usually at the site of the tumor suppressor gene
promoters, leading to silencing of those genes. This in turn causes mitotically
heritable,  epigenetic silencing of tumor
suppression. This silencing is a reversible epimutation but can have the same
effect of a genetic mutation. On its own, the silencing of one
tumor suppressor gene, is not likely to result in lack of tumor suppression,
and it’s thought that multiple DNA hits are needed (Knudson hypothesis). In
addition, CpG island methylation is likely to spread to the CpG island shores
(genes that are near the CpG islands in both directions), and it is also
related to gene expression.</p>

<span>Normal mammalian cells are hypermethylated at
the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements, which aids in genomic
stability. DNA methylation at intergenic regions silences cryptic transcription
start sites, which prevents faulty interference of the translation of two genes
with each other. It also silences cryptic splice sites, preventing unwanted
splicing at the wrong sites. Methylation of repetitive elements silences them,
which prevents their transposition, avoids transcriptional interference, and
prevents illegitimate recombination of DNA. So, it prevents genetic mutations. However,
Cancer cells are hypomethylated at the intergenic regions and the repetitive
elements. This leads to genomic instability such as abnormal repeats
recombination, transposition, and disruption of the neighboring genes. This is
an instance where epimutation results in actual mutation of the DNA sequence,
as it can cause gene insertion, gene deletion, or reciprocal translocations. Such
mutation can lead to aberrant cell function and cancer development.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>At the H19/ Igf2 cluster, CTCF acts as an insulator that
binds to the Imprint Control Region ICR and prevents the enhancers downstream
from increasing the expression of Igf2. When enhancers are not preoccupied with
Igf2, they are free to increase the expression of H19. On the paternal allele
of a normal cell, the imprint control region ICR and H19, of that cluster, are
methylated. Such methylation of the ICR prevents CTCF binding to it. So, on the
paternal allele the enhancers are free to act upon Igf2, increasing its
expression. Also, in this normal cell, the maternal ICR of the H19/Igf2 cluster
is unmethylated. On that allele the ICR is insulated with CTCF which prevents
the enhancers from acting upon Igf2. So, Igf2 expression is suppressed on the
maternal allele, while H19 expression increases. In Wilm’s tumor, loss of
imprinting occurs and the maternal allele acts as the paternal one. Both ICR on
both alleles are methylated which results in over-expression of Igf2, under the
effect of enhancers, and under-expression of H19. Igf2 is growth-promoting
while H19 is growth-inhibiting, which is how such loss of imprinting
contributes to the rapid growth of the kidney seen in Wilm’s tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Usually DNA-methylation leads to suppression of the gene
involved. Cancer is associated with faulty methylation of the promoters of
tumor suppressor genes, which results in silencing of those genes.  Tumor suppressor genes are responsible for
regulation of cell growth, therefore, their silencing contributes to aberrant cell
growth. Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA Methyl Transferase inhibitors
DNMTi. It is is used in treatment of Myelodysplastic syndrome that has
progressed to Acute Myeloid Leukemia AML. DNMTi are nucleoside analogues that
are incorporated to the daughter DNA strand during replication. DNMTi bind
irreversibly to DNMT, and in doing so, stop methylation of the daughter strand.
This means that the effect of DNMTi is replication-dependent, and since cancer
cells have higher replication rates, this could lead to some specificity when
the drug is used in the right dose.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation pattern, once established, is maintained
throughout life, except during sensitive periods. Maintenance of DNA
methylation can be achieved through the action of DNA Methyl Transferase
enzymes Dnmt. An example is Dnmt1 that is responsible for maintaining the
random imprinted inactivation of the silent X-chromosome. Following cell
replication, the DNA is hemi-methylated at the regions that used to be
methylated in the parent cell (only the parent strand is methylated). Dnmt1 recognizes
hemi-methylated DNA, binds to it, and causes methylation of the daughter
strand. Another maintenance enzyme is Smchd1 that is responsible for imprinted
X chromosome inactivation. All of this means that the drug effects should take
place in the treated cells and in the daughter cells, as epigenetic changes are
mitotically heritable in their maintenance stage. Sensitive periods are times
when most of the epigenetic marks are reset and epigenetic reprogramming occurs.
This happens during the pre-implantation development and during the primordial
germ cell development. Epigenetic reprogramming is crucial to erase the cell identity
and allow for totipotency. Therefore the use of epigenetic drugs, during those
periods, can result in faulty reseting of marks and aberrant genetic
expression. </p></div>
