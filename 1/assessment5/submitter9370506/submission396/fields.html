    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands in ESCs and
in promoter regions of normal somatic cells stay unmethylated, allowing gene
expression to occur. The methylation of CpG islands in promoters could lead to
the transcriptional silencing of the corresponding genes. Thus, DNA methylation
at CpG islands is a one of mechanisms of gene silencing. CpG islands in
promoters of cancer cells are hypermethylated and this process is associated
with the silencing of tumor suppressor genes that leads to rapid dividing of
cancer cells. </p>

<p><span>The normal function of
DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is the prevention
of non specific transcription of random genes. Cancer cells exhibit
hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements which normally comprise
the majority of a cell's methyl-cytosine content (global DNA hypomethylation).
Hypomethylation leads to genomic instability (deletions, insertions and
translocations) and oncogene activation.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine belongs to
the hypomethylating agents that inhibit DNA methyltransferase. Other
representative of this class of chemotherapy agents is azacitidine. Decitabine
is cytidine analog. Decitanine-induced inhibition of DNA methyltransferase
leads to the formation of newly replicated DNA with unmethylated cytosine
residues, followed by the hypomethylation of the DNA in the next round of
replication and subsequent expression of previously repressed genes, e.g. tumor
suppressor genes. Thus, one of the consequences of decitabine treatment is the
restoration of control over cell growth, = anti-tumor effect.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Human 11p15.5 locus harbors the paternally expressed Igf2 gene
and maternally expressed H19 lncRNA in normal cells. Igf2 and H19 genes are
separated by the imprinting control region (ICR); ICR is methylated on the
paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele.</p><p>Methylation of the ICR on the
paternal allele blocks binding of CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) prevents
transcription of H19 gene and allows activation of Igf2 expression on paternal
chromosome by the downstream enhancer.</p><p><span>Unmethylation
of ICR on the maternal chromosome leads to the binding of CTCF to the ICR and
blocks access of the Igf2 promoter to the enchancers downstream of H19 gene.  = no expression of Igf2 on
maternal chromosome. Instead, CTCF binding promotes H19 transcription on
maternal chromosome.</span></p><p>However, in the case of
Wilm’s tumour, ICR is methylated at both alleles, which leads to expression of
IGF2 from both alleles, accumulation of Igf2 protein and stimulation of cell
growth. </p><p><span>The biallelic expression of Igf2 is also observed in the human
prostate and it is more extensive in
men with associated cancer.</span> </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation is a very attractive target
for development of drugs that could inhibit DNA modifying enzymes. Enduring
effect of the treatment with compounds that change DNA methylation comes from preservation
of methyl marks during mitosis. For example, <span>Decitanine-induced
inhibition of DNA methyltransferase leads to the formation of newly replicated
DNA with unmethylated cytosine residues, followed by the hypomethylation of the
DNA in the next round of replication and subsequent expression of previously
repressed genes. Thus, the effect of Decitanine treatment lasts beyond the
period of drug treatment. However, during extensive epigenetic reprogramming
(pregnancy and few months before it) administration of such compounds is inadvisable as
it could cause reprogramming of baby development that is not compatible with
life.</span></span></p></div>
