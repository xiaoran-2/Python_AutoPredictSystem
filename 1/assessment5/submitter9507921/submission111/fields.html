    <div class="field-value">The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to add methyl groups to DNA. When a methyl group is added, the gene becomes expressed, allowing for specialization of genes in the epigenome. Cancer disrupts the DNA methylation of CpG islands through hypermethylation, which leads to genotypes not being expressed per the normal process. This leads to genomic instability, as well as a "genome-wide loss and a regional gain of DNA methylation" (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3480634/" title="Link: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3480634/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3480634/</a>). Additionally, Tumor suppressor genes are silenced, and tissue specific/imprinted genes are deregulated. All of these disruptions contribute to cancer. <br /><br />Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are generally methylated, so the normal function of DNA methylation is to maintain genomic integrity. Cancer disrupts DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements through deletions, reciprocal translocations and/or insertions that create genetic instability. In cancer, DNA in intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be unmethylated (instead of methylated in normal function), which creates hypomethylation and lead to genetic instability, which contributes to cancer. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the DNMT class of inhibitors. During the methylation process, Decitabine (and DNMT inhibitors in general) binds the nucleotide to then copy the methylation to the daughter strand and so the transferase can no longer be released. This process is division dependent, and since cancer replicates more rapidly than normal cells (hypermethylation), they'll be the most severely affected, creating an anti-tumor effect.  </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The methylation pattern of the paternal allele is that the Igf2 is methylated in a normal cell. This allows for the insulator to become methylated, and the enhancers can act on Igf2 allele, so it becomes expressed in the paternal allele. The methylation pattern of the maternal allele is that the Igf2 is unmethylated in a normal cell. This allows for CTCF to bind the insulator, so the enhancers will bind to the H19 instead. Igf2 will, as a result become silent in the maternal allele (not expressed). The imprinting at the H19/lgf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm's tumor by allowing for a "double-dose" of Igf2, which is growth-promoting, and leads to Wilm's tumor to develop. When the imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted, this contributes to cancer by creating conditions for hyper or hypo methylation. This can lead to a loss of growth restricting gene expression, and an overexpression of growth promoting genes. <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome by effecting the mitotic heritability of the cell. When a cell goes through the mitotic process, daughter cells maintain the same set of genes to create tissue homogeneity. When DNA is altered, these alterations are carried to the daughter cells, and so on and so forth. A sensitive period is a period of development when there is a large amount of cell differentiation occurring at one time, so the genome is more sensitive to epigenetic alterations. Sensitive periods during development include in the gametes (germ cells) and in early development. Treating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable because this is when differentiation of cells occurs, and epigenetic marks are actively remodelled. During this time, DNA could be easily altered, and effect the genome, potentially negatively. </div>
