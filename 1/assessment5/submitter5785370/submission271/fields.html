    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation consists of the addition of a methyl group to the 5 position of cytosine. This chemical change <b>switches off gene expression</b>. CpG islands (CGI) are<b> clusters of the dinucleotide CG</b>, localized throughout the genome, just upstream the promoter of many genes. Around 60 % of the promoters have CGI. Although methylation only occurs in CpG, <b>CGI are usually unmethylated</b>, so the promoter is active and the nearby gene is normally expressed. Nonetheless, i<b>n many tumours CGI become heavily methylated</b>, silencing the expression of the underlying gene. Many genes coding for proteins that inhibit cell growth became inactivated, giving rise to <b>uncontrolled cell division</b>. Hypermethylation not only involves CGI, but also the neighbour regions called CGI shores. CGI and CGI shore hypermethylation is one of the disorders that may contribute to the development of cancer.<br /><br />Methylation elsewhere in the genome shows a different distribution<b>. </b>Unlike CGI<b>, intergenic regions are usually methylated</b> in normal cells to avoid aberrant reading frames in a gene (e.g. an antisense 3'-5' reading frame within an intron). Repetitive elements are parasitic DNA sequences that tend to make copies of themselves and insert anywhere in the genome. <b>Methylation of these repetitive elements aids to keep genome integrity</b> by stopping transposition of these elements, that may result in gene disruption, transcriptional interference, activation of repressed promoters or abnormal recombination.<b> In cancer, over 50 % of physiological methylation is lost.</b> Hypomethylation particularly affects intergenic regions and repetitive elements, resulting in <b>genome instability</b>. Genes that control cell division may become disrupted Other ones that promote cell growth may be disinhibit by activation of normally repressed or even newly created promoters. The alteration in cell division by both these mechanisms contribute to development of cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprinting is an epigenetic mechanism by which <b>only one parental allele is expressed</b>. The other one is inactivated through methylation. An<b> imprinting control region</b> (ICR) is necessary for imprinting to be carried out. <br /><br /><i>H19/Igf2</i> cluster (11q15.5) comprises <i>Igf2</i>, an ICR, <i>H19</i> and genes coding for enhacers that act  both on <i>H19</i> and <i>Igf</i>2. In the paternal allele, ICR is methylated and methylation spreads through the promoter of <i>H19</i>, silencing its expression. The enhancers encoded downstream promote freely <i>Igf2 </i>expression and therefore cell growth. So <i><b>H19</b></i><b> is paternally imprinted.</b> In the maternal allele, ICR is not methylated and binds a protein called CTCF.<i> H19</i> is transcribed normally. CTCF stops the dowstream enhancers from reaching <i>Igf2</i>, so this gene is silenced. The enhacers act exclusively on <i>H19</i> expression.<i> H19</i> encodes an RNA that limits cell growth. So, <i><b>Igf2</b></i><b> is maternally imprinted.</b><br /><br />In Wilm's tumour there is loss of <i>Igf2</i> imprinting by hypermethylation of the maternal allele (ICR and <i>H19</i> promoter), so that CTCF does not bind ICR and <i>H19</i> is not expressed. Thus both alleles promote <i>Igf2</i> expression and repress <i>H19</i>. <b>This change results in excessive cell growth (from twice the normal amount of Igf2 and no H19 expression)</b> and cancer development.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) is an <b>analogue of desoxiribocytosine</b>. It decreases DNA methylation by <b>inhibiting DNA methyltransferases</b> (DNMTs), both DNMT1 and DNMT3. Decitabine is incorpotated to the newly formed DNA strand during replication as if it were desoxiribocytosine. DNMT recognizes decitabine as a substrate and binds it but, unable to get free, establishes an irreversible covalent bond. This union between drug and enzyme is cut by the repairing DNA enzymes. Thus the activity of DNMT and therefore DNA methylation are notably reduced.<br /><br />In some haematological neoplasias, such as myelodisplasic syndromes, gene promoters that control cell growth are hypermethylated, giving rise to uncontrolled cell division. Decitabine has proved useful to treat this sort of tumours by<b> inhibiting methylation</b>, allowing these tumour suppresor genes to be expressed.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic marks, particularly DNA methylation, may have long lasting effects on the epigenome of the cells involved. Intake of methyl donors, such as folate, by the mother may change the DNA methylation pattern in the offpring, at least in mice, and give rise to long lasting consequences such as skin colour or problems with sugar metabolism. DNA methylation pattern is inherited with each mitosis. X chromosome inactivation is based on DNA methylation and occurs at random in cells during early development states. The cells derived from a given mother cell maintain the same inactivated X chromosome no matter how many divisions occur throughout the life of the individual.<br /><br />Depending on the moment of development, the epigenome may be more or less susceptible to external stimuli. In periods when epigenetic marks are erased to be reprogrammed, the cell is particularly sensitive to enviromental stimuli. These moments of development are called <b>sensitive periods</b> and occur during <b>preimplantation development</b> (around 10 days after fertilization) and during <b>germ cell development</b>. It is not a good idea to treat patients (or pregnant mothers) during sensitive periods as drugs <b>may interfere with epigenome laying down</b> and result in serious conditions such as Angelman syndrome or  tumours.</div>
