    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are regions in the genome
that are enriched in a high percentage in cytosine’s preceding a guanine when compared
with the rest of the genome. These regions are usually located close to gene
promoters and the hypermethylation in these regions are usually linked with a
decrease on gene expression.</p><p>In cancer cells, usually there
is an increase of DNA methylation of CpG islands related to tumour suppressor
genes and in imprinted genes. </p><p>When the hypermethylation
leads to the silencing of tumour suppressor gene, they are avoiding inhibitor
signals of growth control in cells and leading to one of the hallmarks of
cancer. These epimutations are fastly selected since they are mitotically
heritable and procure a competitive advantage to cancer cells over the health
tissue. It is unclear whether comes first if the epigenetic or the genetic
mutations. </p><p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are
areas of non-coding DNA located between genes.  In normal cells these regions are usually
methylated so they are densely packaged avoiding expression or recombination
between them. </p><p>In early stages of cancer,
these intergenic regions become hypomethylated so chromatin become more opened.
In normal cells, the densely packaging of the chromosome avoids recombination
between these intergenic regions whereas in the case of cancer they are easily
recombined with genomic identity regions as they are opened because the
hypomethylation. Usually they recombine with the same pair of chromosome or sometimes
with other further regions. The main consequences of this movements are
chromosome deletions, reciprocal translocations between chromosomes and
insertion. These new open chromatin leaves open promoters that were silenced as
well. It occurs in some degree in different tumour types</p><p>









</p><p>All these illegitimate recombination
and activation of promoters and transpositions between genomic regions lead to
a high genomic instability that progresses with time. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic
imprinting is an epigenetic process where some regions of the genome are
silenced with a parent-of-origin specific mark. Imprinted genes are then
only expressed by one parental allele. Selection occurs during early development of the zygote, while
they are cleared during the germ cell line formation. The imprinted genes are
usually related with metabolism or cell growth control.</p>

<p>The genes Igf2 and H19 are adjacent imprinted genes. </p>

<p>In a
normal cell, the imprint control region ICR, localized between Igf2 and H19, for
the maternal allele is blocked with the complex CTCF so it allows the
expression of H19 because of the enhancers attachment. For the paternal allele the ICR is methylated and the next
closest point of attachment for enhancers is Ifg2, which is activated and transcribed.
</p>

<p>In summary, the maternal allele allows the expression of gene H19, involved in
negative regulation of cell growth, while the paternal allele allows the
expression of Igf2 involved in cell proliferation.</p>

<p><span>In
Wilm’s tumor where there is a loss of imprinting, the ICR of the maternal
allele is hypermethylated so that both alleles now express Igf2 producing an increased
and decontrolled signal for cellular overgrowth. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine belongs to DNMT
epigenetic inhibitors group and it’s a nucleoside analogue. This nucleoside
analogue is incorporated into new DNA strand during cell replication. Later, when
the DNMT-1 enzyme arrives to the daughter strand to copy the methylation
pattern from parental strand, it gets blocked irreversible by this nucleoside
analogue and the enzyme cannot longer work and therefore there is no methylation
of the daughter strand so it contributes to diminish the amount of DNA
methylation specially in tumour suppressor genes that were possibly
hypermethylated during tumourigenesis, although the precise mechanism it’s not
yet elucidated. The effectiveness of this compound is replication dependent
since it can only act during cell division. Even though cancer cells seem to be
more susceptible to the treatment because they have a high rate of replication
compared to normal cells, the long-term effects in normal cells are unknown.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The epigenome is a very stable
entity during the whole life of an individual, but it can be altered in some
ways that are not clearly understood yet, mainly because of the environment. Epigenetic
drugs alter the epigenetic machinery targeting enzymes involved directly in methylation
like DNMT1 or histone acetylation as HDACi and others involved in chromatin
remodelling. Even if cancer cells are more susceptible to drugs because their higher
grow rate, the effects of this drugs may alter the machinery of normal cells
and specially in tissues that also have a high replication rate such as bone
narrow or skin cells. Other important point is sensitive periods of epigenome
that are periods of time where epigenome is more easily altered. It includes
preconception and early stages of embryo development, the germ cell line
formation period and in the case of new-borns where some organs such as brain,
lungs or other need to continue developing. Therefore there are groups of
patients where won’t be advisable to use the epigenetic drugs. These groups
would be persons who want to have their own kids in the future, pregnant women
and kids under two years because it’s a critical period for development.</p></div>
