    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>

</p><p>Dr. Dhank and his team
discovered the inhibitor GSK2816126, which is used to treat lymphoma cells by
reducing the rapid multiplying of the tumor cells while having no effect on
nearby cells. </p><p><span>Dr. Bradner and his team
discovered that JQ1 inhibits the epigenetic regulation BRD4, which was the way
of blocking the activity of Myc since it could not be blocked directly.  Myc encoded a transcription factor that was
involved in expressing 15 percent of human gene, which is a common cause of
cancer when it is expressed in myeloma cells. These two discoveries led to
Decitabine. </span></p><p>



</p><p>Decitabine belongs in the 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine class. It
demethlayates DNA, by acting as a <span>DNA
methyltransferase inhibitor. They get incorperated into the DNA and when DNMT1
comes to bind the nucleotide to the daughter strand, its bond cannot be released
and the daughter cell cannot be replicated, thus slowing the growth of tumor.
This process can only happen during replication. </span></p><p>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation (DNAme) of the CpG island can be useful in
disrupting cancer because of bio-markers. 
There are particular CpG islands that are hypermethylated in certain
cancers, which helps determine if the cell is cancerous or normal and where
they are located, helping doctors determine effectively how to treat their patients.  </span></p>

<p><span>            The
disruption of DNAme contribute to the production of cancerous cells because of
the hypermethylation in the CpG islands of promoters of the tumor suppressor
gene.  A cancer cell could active the
tumor suppressor gene to be silenced, thus turning it off.  This process causes the tumor to be able to
grow which, along with several others factors, causes cancer according to the
Knudson hypothesis. </span></p>

<p><span>            DNAme is
the addition of a methyl group to the DNA. Methylation occurs mostly at CpG
dinucleotides when cells are dividing. 
DNA methyltransferases DNMT1 (enzymes) lay down the methylation in a de
novo fashion (laying down methylated marks). Methylation silences gene
expression, turning off the methylation of the daughter cell during duplication
until DNMT1 recognizes and bind to the hemi-methylated DNA laying down
methylation on the daughter strand.  </span></p>

<p><span>            DNAme at
the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are there to maintain genomic
integrity and avoid transcriptional interference. In every cancer study
conducted, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be
unmethylated, thus causing hypomethylation. 
This process contributes to cancer because of genomic instability like
deletions, reciprocal translocations and insertions.  </span></p>

<p><span>            DNAme is
context dependent. Some types of cancer depend on hypermethylation to divide
the cancer cell in a more rapidly, thus growing the tumor.  Other types of cancer however depend on
hypomethylation to silence tumor suppressor genes.  A number of cancer cells can start out one
way and change during later stages, which can make it harder to choose the
epigenetic drugs use to deplete DNMT1 and their effectiveness to treat the
cancer.  </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation is usually located at the promoters and involves
silencing.  DNA methylation at the ICR (imprint
control regions) have different mechanism of action, meaning that the gene will
not be silenced. DNA methylation will also tell you if the gene is maternal or
paternal.</span></p>

<p>When the ICR is unmethylated on
the maternal allele, it is bound by an insulator protein CTCF. During chromosome
looping enhancers, it would be ideal to have an active Igf2 (a growth promoter),
but due to the CTCF binding in the ICR, is blocked. The enhancers act on H19,
letting it be free to express on the maternal allele. In regards to the
paternal allele, ICR is methylated so the CTCF cannot bind, enabling the enhancer
Igf2 expression to happen, thus creating a paternal imprinted gene. The loss of
DNA methylation at the ICR is common in most cancer cells.</p>

<p><span>  Many abnormalities can occur in cancer cells
though due to epigenetic disruption, mutation, or deletion causing loss of
Cdkn1c (tumor suppressor) and Igf2, which can be overly expressed and cause the
loss of imprinting.  One of the
abnormalities is called Beckwiedmann Syndrome, which causes an abundance of
growth and leads to childhood tumors like Wilm’s tumor, which are
located in the kidneys. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p></p><p>

</p><p><span>Dr.
Stephen Baylin and his fellow researcher have been developing a combination of
epigenetic drugs that are being use to fight the growth of tumors in some
people.   Tumors are harder to penetrate
than blood cancers.  At first, the
process </span><span>did not show much response, but as time progressed, their
work went on to show very good results to the routine chemotherapeutic treatments.  During the scientific trials, the inhibitor drug
GSK2816126 was found to </span>drastically declined the amount of histone
overmethylation (over growth of cells) which was caused by mutations. That
process reduced the life of tumor cells by changing the DNA methylation of the cancer
cells. These changes in the epigenetics machinery are passed on during cell
division to daughter and granddaughter cells, until they will be erased and not
able to return.</p><p>

</p><p><span>These types of drugs are being
studied to be used not only in cancer cases, but other diseases where the
epigenetic makeup has been disturbed.  Every
cell could be affected, so treatment during the sensitive times in younger
patients might be detrimental. The sensitive time periods would include development
of germ cells (puberty), the early stages of pregnancy when reprogramming is happening
and early development and primordial germ cell development. </span></p></div>
