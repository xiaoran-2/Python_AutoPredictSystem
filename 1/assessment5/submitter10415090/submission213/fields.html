    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands:</p>

<p>In normal cells,
CpG islands tend to be protected from methylation, so they are usually
hypomethylated. However, CpG islands hypermethylation have been frequently found
in cancer. In DNA, methylation is related to silencing, so when there is
hypermethylation in CpG islands that control the expression of tumour supressor
genes, this methylation may cause cancer.</p>

<p><span><br /><br /></span>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements:</p>

<p>In normal cells, intergenic
regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated in order to avoid
genomic instability. In cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are
hypomethylated, leading to genomic instability (illegitimate recombinations, activation of repeats
and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters, disruption of neighbouring
genes, deletions, insertions or reciprocal translocations). This genomic instability may be one of the reasons responsible for cancer. </p><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><i>H19/Igf2 </i>cluster is a parental
imprinted cluster, which means that the paternal allele is methylated, while
the maternal allele remains unmethylated. CTCF
is an insulator protein able to bind the imprinted control region (ICR)
of <i>H19/Igf2
</i>cluster<i> </i>when it is unmethylated,
so to the maternal allele. In the maternal allele <i>Igf2</i> are
protected of being expressed when CTCF is bound to the ICR, thus some
enhancers (encoded downstream) activate the <i>H19</i> expression and do not
active <i>Igf2 </i>expression. However, in
the paternal allele ICR is methylated so CTCF is not able to bind and does not
protect <i>Igf2 </i>of being expressed. So,
in normal cells IGF2 protein is expressed from the paternal allele. In
Wilm's tumour, both maternal and paternal alleles are hypermethylated. This
prevents from CTCF binding and brings about IGF2 overexpression. IGF2 is an
insulin-like growth factor that promotes cell growth, so when it is
overexpressed there is an abnormal growth (Wilm's tumour).</p><span><br /><br /></span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug
that targets the epigenetic machinery and it is classified as a <i>De Novo Methyltransferase inhibitor</i> (DNMTi). These drugs
(5-azacytidine, decitabine, etc.) are nucleoside analogues that are
incorporated into DNA upon replication. When DNMT bind to the DNMTi
incorporated into DNA, trying to methylate the daughter strand, the DNMT is
bound irreversibly and it is inhibited. Tumour cells are more likely to be
affected by DNMTi because DNMT act during the replication and these cells have
higher replication rate. Hypomethylation
is caused w<span>hen using DNMTi ,
which may activate tumour suppressor genes that were silenced by abnormal
methylation. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The alteration of the
DNA methylation state can have enduring effects on the epigenome since
epigenetic modifications are mitotically inheritable. This means that
epigenetic modifications are passed to the daughter cells in cell division. So
if you alter DNA methylation in a particular gene of a cell, its daughter cells
will have this gene epigenetically altered as well. In human development there are some spans
of time where epigenetic remodeling is critical and very active. These periods
are known as sensitive periods and are the period of primordial germ cell
development (production of eggs and sperm), pre-implantation period and
post-implantation period. It would be inadvisable to treat patients during
sensitive periods because it could have fatal consequences in development due
to this intense epigenetic remodeling.</p></div>
