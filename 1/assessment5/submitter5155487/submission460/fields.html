    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The
main function of DNA methylation is to silence the gene expression, it usually
occurs at CpG islands at gene promoters converting cytosine to
5-methylcytosine. Cancer shows
hypermethylation of CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes (induction of cell
proliferation) and at ICRs to loss imprinting and genome-wide hypomethylation
at repetitive elements, intergenic 
regions , and CpG poor promoters  to induce genomic instability. DNA methylation
at repetitive elements aims to preserve genome integrity by preventing
transposition and illegitimate recombination and at intergenic regions to
silence cryptic transcription and splice sites and to maintain genomic
stability. Hypomethylation at both repetitive elements and intergenic regions
in cancer leads to genomic instability by activation of transposition of
repeats and recombination (insertions, deletions, and reciprocal translocation
and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighbouring  genes such as <i><span> A</span></i>vy.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li><p></p><p></p></li></ul><p>Enhancer blocking is the mechanism behind
imprinting in  H19/Igf2 cluster. Igf2 is maternally imprinted gene. At maternal
allele: CTCF (insulator protein) protects ICR from methylation and prevents
Igf2 activation by downstream enhancers, so H19 gene is only activated while Igf2
is silenced. At paternal allele: ICR and H19 promoter is methylated, so Igf2 is
activated (no CTCF). DNA hypermethylation in cancer leads to maternal ICR
methylation preventing the binding of CTCF and overexpression of Igf2  which is an oncogene resulting in Wilm's
tumor.<br /></p><b></b><p></p><p></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is DNA methyltransferase inhibitors
(DNMTi, so acting as hypomethylating agent decreases DNA methylation at tumor
suppressor genes. It is nucleoside analogue which binds irreversibly to DNMT.
It is used for treatment of myelodysplastic
syndrome (MDS).</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Changes in epigenetic marks as DNA methylation
is long-lasting because it is mitotically inherited and lasts after cell
division in daughter cells. Sensitive periods are those in which any change in epigenetic
marks leads to dramatic change in the epigenome. They are in early embryonic
development and in primordial germ cell development.  treating patients during sensitive periods
would be inadvisable
because it may lead to major permanent side effects.</p>
