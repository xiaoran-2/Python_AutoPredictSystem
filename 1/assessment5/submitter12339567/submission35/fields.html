    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normally CpG islands are hypomethylated and the intergenic regions  and repetitive elements are hypermethylated.<br />In cancer this pattern is disrupted : CpG islands are hypermethylated and the latter regions are hypomethylated.<br />Because of this hypermethylation in CpG islands, tumor suppressor gene are often silenced.<br />So, genes for growth factors and other oncogene are activated.<br />Therefore cancer cells growth is abnormal and their division is more rapidly.<br />Normally hypermethylation in the intergenic regions and repetitive elements is associated with great genomic stability.<br />During cancer hypomethylation in these regions leads to genomic instability and several copying errors (insertions, deletions and reciprocal translocation in the chromosome).</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a normal  cell the H19/Igf2 locus is methylated in the parental allele at the ICR, while it isn't methylated in the maternal allele.<br />Therefore, the CTCF complex binds to the allele on the maternal strand and the downstream enhancer act on H19; the result is that Igf2 is insulated from the enhancer.<br />On the other hand, in the paternal allele, DNA methylation at the ICR , blocks binding of CTCF binding and, without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence and enhancer can access Igf2 to activate.<br />Therefore, in a normal cell we observe a normal dose of both H19 from materna strand and Igf2 from paternal strand.<br />When imprinting is disrupted , ICR becomes hypermethylated and both strands appear to be of paternal origin.<br />In this situation there is up regulation of Igf2 and a predisposition to embryonic/childhood tumors (e.g. Wilm's tumor).</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent used to treat myelodysplasic syndromes, the precursor of acute myelogenous leukemia.<br />The cytosine analogues 5-azacytosina and 2'-deoxy-5- azacytidina (decitabine) acts as DNA methyltransferase inhibitors and have shown substantial potency in reactivating epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor genes in vitro.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Dr. Bayling believes that his epigenetic drugs can modulate DNA methylation on the epigenome and alter the tumor cells in some lasting way that made them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy.<br />Unlike other forms of gene regulation, epigenetic changes (e.g. methyl-marks), caused by global epigenetic intervention and environmental factors, may alter epigenetic makeup, especially during critical "sensitive periods"(periods of time where extensive epigenetic reprogramming occurs). These epigenetic tags are passed on , during cell division, to daughter and grand daughter cells until they are actively erased which could be what make Dr Baylin's discover possible.<br />Therefore, it would be inadvisable to prescribe these treatments to pregnant mothers during sensitive periods in order to avoid that they may alter epigenetic makeup during the establishment of epigenetic marks in the early embryonal development and during the formation of gametes.</div>
