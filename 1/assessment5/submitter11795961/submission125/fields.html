DNA
Methylation is stable epigenetic mark, which is specified by adding methyl
group to DNA and it could be passed on to other cell generations. It plays
important role in normal development of cell, for example genomic
imprinting, X chromosome inactivation and so on. It prevents cell to
revert to stem cell or different cell type. It modifies function of DNA - gene
transcription. In genom we can find regions which are hypermethylated of
hypomethylated. Methylation could be found approximately in 70-80% of CpG
dinucleotides. CpG islands are sites with frequent CpG dinucleotides and could
be found in promotor regions, which are unmethylated in normal cells. In cancer
cells CpG islands in promotor regions become hypermethylated, which cause
silencing of gene (tumor suppressor gene). There are also CpG shores which are
2kb regions next to CpG islands usually methylated in cancer cell. CpG shores
better predict expression of CpG islands. DNA methylation can also occur in ICR
(imprint control region), where its methylations results, for example, in loss
of expression of growth restriction and therefor tumor growth. On the other
hand in cancer epigenetics we can found regions which are hypomethylated
(genome wide hypomethylation), it concern intergenic regions, but mostly
repetitive elements. These repetitive elements secure genome stability. Due to
hypomethylation of these repetitive elements deletion, insertion, reciprocal
translocation and others could occur. Also CpG islands which are hypomethylated
could lead to increase of oncogene transcription. These changes in epigenome
could be found in early tumor stages and could progress during the time. It also
depends on type of tissue, age, location, sex and so on. DNA Methylation in
cancer genesis definitely play important role and is associated with different
clinicopathological characteristics which are crucial for patient management and
outcome.</p><p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Genomic
imprinting is epigenetic modification, quite rare in mammals and independent of
Mendelian inheritance, which lead to parent-origin gene expression (maternal or
paternal). Disorders connected to genomic imprinting are for example Angelmann
and Prader-Willi syndrome, but it is linked with cancerogenesis as well, for example
embryonic kidney tumor (Willms tumor) and others (lungs, colon etc.). Imprinted
genes are usually somehow connected with growth of tissue, either activating or
repressing of growth. Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IgF2) is growing factor whose
expression is increased in many tumors, beside H19 is gene which suppress
growth of tissue. Both of these genes are imprinted (H19 maternally, IgF2
paternally expressed in normal cells). Normally H19 suppress IgF2, due to unmethylation
of ICR on maternal allele, which then activate enhancers and they induce H19
expression which suppress IgF2, but in cancer cells H19 gene loose imprinting,
due to methylation of ICR on maternal allele which leads to overexpression of
IgF2 (both IgF2 alleles are now active) and tumor growth.   </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">

<p class="MsoNormal">Decitabine (synonym – Dezocitidine, Azadc, 5-Azadeoxycytidine
etc.) is chemical analog of cytidine, nucleoside present in DNA and RNA. It is cytidine
antimetabolite and belongs to the class of 1,3,5-triazine ribonucleosides and
ribnucleotides. The drug was approved on May 2, 2006 by FDA and it is used for
myelodysplastic syndromes and myelodysplastic syndromes of all French-American-British
subtypes treatment. It converts to decitabine triphosphate and incorporates
into DNA during replication and RNA during transcription and leads to
inhibition DNA methyltransferase, therefor it leads to hypomethylation of DNA
and cellular differentiation or apoptosis. In cancer cells it may restore
normal function to genes that are crucial to cell differentiation and
proliferation. Normal cells are relatively insensitive to decitabine.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is process of adding methyl group to DNA
which is one of the epigenetic modification. It is done by DNMT enzyme and is mitotically
heritable. Epigenetic reprograming occurs in two periods of time. One in early
development after the egg is fertilized and second in primordial germ cells development.
These two periods of time are two most sensitive periods when epigenetic
reprograming occur (cleared and reset of epigenetic marks – DNA methyl. etc.)
and could be affected as well. There are also other periods of time when
epigenetic reprograming could occur and be influenced. Any disruption (drugs,
environment, radiation etc.) in these periods can lead to further development
errors. Treatment in these periods when the differentiation (pluripotent state to fully differentiated cell) take place would be very unwise. After reprograming the epigenetic marks, they are quite stable and copied to
daughter cells. On the other hand, epigenetic marks can be reversible for
example by using drugs which aim to improve patient survival. We must be aware
of potential systemic side effect due to different epigenetic modifications in
distinct tissues. Mechanism of action of these drugs are not still 100% clear.</p>
