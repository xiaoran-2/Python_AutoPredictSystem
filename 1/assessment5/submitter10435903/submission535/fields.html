    <div class="field-value">In our genome, CpG islands are mainly found in promoter regions and in normal cells, they are not highly methylated.  When the CpG islands are methlyated it usually silences the expression of the gene for which that promoter works.  In cancer, the CpG islands become hypermethylated, often in the CpG islands found in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes.  This then silences the tumor suppressor genes whose role it is to stop or slow the cell cycle when necessary.  The result is that the cell starts to divide more often and accumulate more mutations, contributing to the rise of a tumor cell.  <br />Unlike the CpG islands, which are not highly methylated in normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are typically highly methylated in normal cells.  This protects the genome from the genetic instability that can result from these regions being unmethylated and in a relaxed and open state.  In cancer, these repetitive regions become lose their methylation and often result in the loss of heterochromatin structure.  As a result, these repetitive elements can recombine with repeats on differing chromosomes, causing reciprocal translocations.  This demethyation can also result in activation of these repeats, which may cause transposition of this repeat, which may disrupt genes elsewhere in the genome or the promoters of the repeats may cause activation of neighboring genes.  Finally, this demethylation may affect some microRNA's that target tumor suppressor genes.  The tumor suppressor genes are then inactivated and fail to slow the cell cycle.  <br />Often in cancer, this hypermethylation of CpG islands and genome wide hypomethylation are both present in the tumor cells and their presence is often varied in different tumors and can change throughout the progression of tumor development.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Hypermethylation and hypomethylation can also occur at the imprinting control regions(ICR's), again leading to the change in expression status which can contribute to the development of cancer.  An example is the hypermethylation of the ICR region at the H19/Ifg2 cluster.  On the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated which spreads to the promoter of the H19 gene, blocking the enhancers from working on the H19 gene. This in turn allows the enhancers to activate Igf2.  On the maternal allele, the ICR is not methylated and is bound by a CTCF insulator protein that blocks the enhancer from activating the Igf2 gene.  It can, however, activate the H19 gene.  <br />In Wilm's tumor, methylation of the ICR for the H19/Igf2 cluster is seen.  This allows for activation of the Igf2 gene on both alleles in these cells.  As a result, the cells exhibit overexpression of Igf2, which is a growth promoting gene.  As the cell receives this overabundance of growth promoting signals, it can lead to uncontrolled growth and the promotion of tumor growth.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor.  DNA methyltransferases are a class of enzymes that will lay down methyl groups onto the CpG islands on the DNA.  DNMTi's such as Decitabine mimic DNA nucleotides and can become incorporated into the DNA during replication.  They can then bind DNMT's irreversibly, rendering them unable to continue to add methyl groups to the DNA.  As a result, the methylation pattern will not be copied on the new strand of DNA in these cells and their descendant cells.  Although the Decitabine will not kill the cells, it will cause a decrease in methylation, which may slow or halt the growth of these cells, removing the tumorigenicity.  </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic drugs can having longer lasting effects than chemotherapeutic drugs because epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable.  If an epigenetic change is created because of therapy, these changes will be maintained in all descendant cells unless they are actively removed.  This active removal is not performed with each cell division.  There are a couple of periods in development known as sensitive periods; pre-implantation early embryonic development and primordial germ cell development.  These are referred to as sensitvie periods because during these periods there is a clearing of many epigenetic marks. Treating patients with epigenetic drugs during these sensitive periods such as primordial germ development may not be advisable because these epigenetic drugs may disrupt the reprogramming of the epigenetic marks. In primordial germ cell development, imprinting marks are reset maternally in females and paternally in males.  If epigenetic drugs are given during this time, we may end up with disruption of the clearing of epigenetic marks or the resetting of imprints.  In either case, this can increase the liklihood of epigenetic errors in the germ cells.  This could potentially increase the risk of epigenetic abnormalities in the germ cells or the passing down of imprinted or epigenetic disorders to their offspring.</div>
