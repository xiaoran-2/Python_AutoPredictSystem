    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a
normal cell, there is a hypomethylated CPG island but you find that the genome
in general is methylated in their repetitive elements through the intergenic regions
and indeed even in the introns of  genes<br /></p><p>In a cancer
cell the CGI are more likely to be methylated. They're not all
methylated, but they're more likely to be methylated than in a normal cell. And
the rest of the genome in general are hypomethylated.</p><p><span>In general these CpG are found in the promoters of tumour
suppressor genes. </span>This CGI hypermethylation and associated gene silencing occurs frequently
in tumours probably because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. So it's a
very effective way of  silencing a tumour
suppressor gene, and these epimutations can indeed be rapidly selected.</p><p>In
comparison to a genetic mutation  these epimutations, the DNA hypermethylation,
is reversible. This brings up the option of remove some
of that methylation therapeutically.</p><p>













</p><p>This tumours
suppressor hypermethylation<span> in general is more frequent than  genetic mutation and varies by tumour type. We
also know that CPGI methylation  progresses with time, as the cancer progresses
we get increased methylation of CpG islands. So, this can be very useful
diagnostically and prognostically.</span></p><p>So these
epigenetic mistakes or hypomethylation of genomic wide affects to repeats or repetitive
elements and to CpG poor promoters. But the
hypomethylationthat occurs is  most commonly
occurring at repeats. And is rarer
anywhere else.</p><p>



</p><p><span>One of the
functions of is to maintain genomic stability. 
So then if you have hypomethylation of 
repeats or indeed intergenic intervals, the  consequence of this is genomic</span> instability like Illegitimate  recombination between repeats (reciprocal
translocations) because they are not densely packaged  down into heterochromatin. The hypoethylation
also can make jump around the genome or transpose.  This can result in additional deletions,
insertions and reciprocal translocation in cancer. </p><p><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Igf2H19 cluster
is the imprint control region. It's methylated on the paternal allele, and it's
unmethylated on the maternal allele. </p>

<p><span>When it's
unmethylated CTCF will binds this insulator element, and it means that the enhancers
in this case will act on H19. But Igf2 will be silent for the maternal  allele, so we don't see expression. </span></p>

<p>On the paternal
allele, because this is methylated, now the enhancers can act on Igf2, because
CTCF is not binding to inhibit this, and IGF2 is expressed from the pattern allele.
</p>

<p>However,
with loss of imprinting and what happened is you have hypermethylation of the
imprint control region on the maternal allele as well, now, on the maternal
allele, you also have expression of Igf2. </p>

<p><span>So now you
have a double dose of Igf2 in comparison to what you saw in a normal cell.And
Igf2 is growth promoting, and this is associated with Wilms’ tumour. This is this
particular childhood kidney tumour.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Is a DNA-demethylating agents <span>used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.</span><br />Decitabine hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase.It functions in a similar manner to azacitidine, although decitabine can only be incorporated into DNA strands while azacitidine can be incorporated into both DNA and RNA chains.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The drugs can alter the hypomethylation or hypermethylation of the gen supressors. By the reprogramming of epigenetic marks in the human development the drugs don`t must be applied in the sensitive periods of PGC development, and during the fertilised egg and embryo because there is a demethylation in the genome and the reprogramming generatees that the epigenetic marks will be erased and caused new tumour cells.</div>
