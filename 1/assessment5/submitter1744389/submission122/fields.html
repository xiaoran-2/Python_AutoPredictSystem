    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is one type of epigenetic marks; it is the addition of a
methyl group to a nucleotide, not changing it in the DNA sequence but altering
the degree of expression of this DNA strain. It is mitotically heritable and
quite stable, reprogrammed only during specific stages of development: gametogenesis
and after fertilization. Methylated and not methylated regions are conserved
within cells from the same cell line, and differ between cell lines.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, CpG islands (dinucleotides of cytosine – C – and guanine
– G) in normal cells are hypomethylated (lower degree of methylation), while
intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated (higher degree
of methylation). In cancer cells, this methylation pattern is swapped: CpG
islands are hypermethylated while intergenic regions and repetitive elements
are hypomethylated.</p>

<p>CpG islands in normal cells are usually related to promoters of tumor suppressing
genes, and the lack of methylation allow the expression of these genes; in
cancer cells, when CpG islands are usually hypermethylated, these genes, and
other related to cell cycle, apoptosis, DNA repair, etc. are silenced. CpG
island shores, regions nearby CpG islands (2kb), also have different
methylation patterns between normal and cancer cells: in the latter are usually
hypermethylated too, and correlate with gene expression.</p>

<span>In normal cells, hypermethylation
of intergenic regions and repetitive elements is linked to highly expressed
genes. Its role is not clear although it has been suggested that it represses
transcriptional noise, inhibits antisense transcription and is related to
replication timing. Therefore, in cancer cells, the reduction of methylation of
these regions would lead to the opposite consequences: higher transcriptional
noise and antisense transcriptions; overall, higher genomic instability and
deregulation of genome expression/transcription.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The paternal allele presents methylation of the ICR and the H19 gene promoter
region; this methylation pattern silences the expression of H19, and downstream
enhancers can be expressed and enhance the production of iGf2.</p>

<p>The maternal allele has no methylation in the ICR neither in the H19 gene
promoter region, consequently, CTCF can link to the ICR and H19 can be
expressed, suppressing the enhancers and finally not expressing Igf2.</p>

<p><span>In Wilm’s tumour, both maternal and paternal alleles are methylated in the
ICR and H19 gene promoter region; consequently Igf2 is expressed by both
alleles, i.e. overexpressed.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating
agent; it inhibits the methylation of DNA. Taking into account that one of the
most extended hallmarks among different cancer types, specially haematopoietic
ones, is the hypermethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements,
decitabine can have anti-tumour effect by demethylating these regions.
Decitabine has been approved for to treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes, the
precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation acts as a silencing or activating mark for the expression
of DNA sequences, among which those that encode other epigenetic marks as long
non coding RNA, or other molecules involved in epigenetic regulation. Altering
DNA methylation can have consequences on the expression of these other
molecules, and eventually on the epigenome.</p>

<p>A sensitive period is a period during which epigenetic marks are
reprogrammed; during development, the sensitive periods are the generation of
the germ cells (eggs and sperm), fertilization and embryo early development.</p>

<p><span>Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because the
long term consequences, currently unknown, could affect the children or even the
grandchildren of these patients, precisely because DNA methylation patterns can
be inherited.</span></p></div>
