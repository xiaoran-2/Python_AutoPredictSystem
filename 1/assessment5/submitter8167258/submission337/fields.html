    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value">In normal cells CpG islands in gene promoters are mostly not methylated. In cancer cells CpG islands in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes often become methylated thus contributing to mitotically heritable silencing of these genes. Low level or non-transcription of tumor suppressor genes caused by this process in concert with other possible genetic and epigenetic alterations may drive a cell to cancerous phenotype by removing brakes to proliferation, avoiding apoptosis after DNA damage etc. Different tumor types exhibit different patterns of CpG islands hypermethylation and the process generally progresses with time and age of the patient.<br /><br />Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated in normal cells and the loss of these epigenetic marks may contribute to cancer. Loss of methylation in repetitive elements leads to genomic instability by enchancing the possibility of their activation and moving throughout the genome. It also may lead to improper recombination between chromosomes and activation of cryptic promoters.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">H19/Igf2 is one of the best studied imprinted genetic loci in which expression of lncRNA H19 and mRNA of gene Igf2 is reciprocally regulated in <i>cis </i>in parent-of-origin dependent manner.<br /><br />This locus is controlled by imrinting control region (ICR) situated between Igf2 and H19 genes which contains binding sites for insulator protein CTCF.<br /><br />On the maternal allele the ICR is not methylated and CTCF can bind to it so that downstream enchancers can act on H19 lncRNA gene causing its expression but not on Igf2 because of CTCF interference.<br /><br />On the paternal allele the ICR is methylated and CTCF can't bind to it allowing enchancers to act on Igf2 gene causing its expression. Methylation of ICR is spread to H19 promoter silencing its expression.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumor biallelic expression of Igf2 occurs because ICR of H19/Igf2 locus is methylated on both maternal and paternal chromosomes. Igf2 gene overexpression contributes to cancer in Wilm's tumor because it functions as growth promoter.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine (Dacogen) is the DNA-demethylating agent, analog of cytosine nucleoside, which acts as DNA methyltransferase inhibitor and also probably as apoptosis inductor. Mechanism of its action is not completely clear, but it involves incorporaton of Decitabine into DNA, inducing hypomethylation, blocking of DNA synthesis and non-reversible covalent linking to DNMT. Thus it has a potency of reactivating epigenetically silenced tumor supressor genes by demethylation of their promoters, inducing of differentiation and supressing of tumor growth. It is successfully used for treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes probably because of their high dependence on silencing of tumor supressor genes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable so the drug-induced changes in these epigenetic marks are transfered to daughter cells of cancer cell. This progeny will be similarly susceptible as the first cell to chemotherapy if the epigenetic drug, for example, succeded in reactivating tumor supessor genes silenced in this cancer. It provides lasting susceptibility of cancer cells after stopping treatment.<br /><br />In so called sensitive periods of development, such as preimplantation during pregnancy, rapid epigenetic reprogramming occurs. Some organs (brain) and processes (germ cell development) are also susceptible to epigenetic influences in early life.<br /><br />These drugs should not be prescribed during sensitive periods as they may interfere with these delicate epigenetic processes and probably result in developmental defects in embryo, behavioral and mental defects, germ cell development disruptions in children.</div>
