    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell DNA methylation is high in intergenic regions and introns and at repetitive elements and it is low at CpG islands (DNA methylation at repetitive elements is important for maintaining these in a silent state). In a cancer cell the reverse of this DNA methylation pattern is observed and the hypermethylation found at CpG islands in cancer cells usually results in silencing of tumor suppressor genes resulting in uncontrolled cell growth (Methylated CpG islands tend to occur at tumor suppressor gene promoters, perhaps as a result of evolutionary selection). The silencing of tumor suppressor genes in a cell likely affords it a competitive growth advantage over surrounding cells and the DNA methylation is mitotically inheritable. Such epimutations are rapidly selected for which is good for the cells under consideration but causes cancer in the organism overall, and this is ultimately detrimental to that organism. The hypomethylation observed at intergenic regions in cancer cells leads to genome instability (<i>e.g.</i> reciprocal translocations, deletions, insertions) and insertions of cryptic promoters at points in the genome, as a result of hypomethylated repetitive elements, causes inappropriate gene expression (<i>e.g.</i> agouti viable yellow and axin fused alleles). Hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters, that are usually methylated and thus inactive, can lead to inappropriate gene activation (<i>e.g.</i> the oncogene R-RAS in gastric cancer or miR21 leading to less of the tumor suppressor protein PTEN being expressed).<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Hypermethylation or hypomethylation of Imprint Control Regions (ICRs) can lead to growth restricting genes being under expressed or growth promoting genes being over expressed. Imprinted genes tend to be involved in either the promotion or suppression of growth. At the H19/Igf2 cluster in a normal cell the paternal allele is methylated which prevents CTCF from binding to the ICR and allows the expression of Igf2 to take place. The maternal allele in this cluster in a normal cell is not methylated and CTCF is able to bind to the ICR with the result that H19 is expressed instead of Igfr2. In Wilm's tumor (a kidney tumor) the paternal and maternal alleles are both methylated resulting in a double dose of the growth promoting Igf2 being produced. This presumably leads to tumor formation. Loss of imprinting occurs as a very early event and is observed in many tumor types. It is often seen in pre-neoplastic tissue even before a tumor can actually be detected.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine (Dacogen) is a hypomethylating or DNA-demethylating agent that inhibits DNMT1. It, along with the very similar drug azacitadine (Vidaza), is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes which are the precursors of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). These small-molecule drugs are cytidine nucleoside analogues that contain an N instead of a C atom at the 5 position of the cytosine ring. They are incorporated into DNA and when the DNMT attempts to methylate the residue at the 5 position it "gets stuck". This ends its enzymatic activity resulting in a lower overall level of DNA methylation. I don't see this as being a particularly well targeted drug as it would appear to hit normal and cancerous cells alike, but it works and is well tolerated. Hypermethylation of CpG islands causes suppression of tumor suppressor protein expression and if DNA methylation can be reduced this is advantageous in such a situation.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically inheritable and this would go some way to explaining how drugs that alter DNA methylation could have an effect beyond the period of drug treatment. Sensitive periods are when epigenetic marks are being erased and reset within the genome. These occur during primordial germ cell development and the pre-implantaion period of early development of the embryo. It would presumably be inadvisable to modify the genome during such times for fear of inappropriately introducing or deleting epigenetic marks that may have long-term detrimental effects on the organism. Of the two drug types used by Baylin, Vidaza (a hypomethylating agent) along with a histone-deacetylase inhibitor, it is likely that the latter would cause the DNA to remain in the more open euchromatin state, as opposed to the more condensed heterochromatin state, and thus be more accessible to various drugs and enzymes although I suspect that epigenetic histone acetylation is less likely to be mitotically inheritable than is DNA methylation.<br /></div>
