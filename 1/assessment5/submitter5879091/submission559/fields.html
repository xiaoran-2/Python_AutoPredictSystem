    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value">In normal cells DNA methylation acting upon promoter regions at CpG Islands assures proper regulation of gene expression - basically avoiding spurious transcription initiations. THis situati on is reversed in cancerous cells. CpG Islands are prone to hypermethylation which leads to the silencing of tumour sup pressing genes and the consequent uncontrolled division of a cancerous cell. As for DNA methylation of intergenic regions and ripetitive elements, the normal situati on is for hypermethylation to ensure genomic stability. In cancerous cells the situati on is reversed whereby the consequent hypomethylation is associated with copying errors such as deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">There is paternal allele methylation at the ICR in a cell around the H19/igf2 locus and no methylation for the maternal allele. The allele on the maternal strand isbound to by the ctcf complex and the downstream enhancers act on H19. The methyl Marks leave the paternal allele intouched by the ctcf complex , which leads to silencing of the H19 gene. Thus in a normal cell there is a regular dose of H19 from the maternal strand and Igf2 from the paternal strand. When  the ICR becomes hypermethylated, both strand s appear paternal and are espressed. the consequence is a double dose of growth promoting Igf2 minus dose of H19. this is associated with Wilm's tumour</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to a class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors that contribute to hypomethylation of DNA - useful in treating a bone narrow aliment which is a precursor of a form of acute leucemia. the effectiveness of Decitabine has been link ed to its anti tumori al reactivation of epigenetically silenced tumour sup pressor genes silenced by hypomethylation.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Treatments can be target ed via DNA a methylation be cause it can be manipula ted once and the DNA methyltransferase enzymes preserve methyl marks during mitosi s . However, these interventions may interfere with the system durIng sensitive periods - periods where epigenetically re programming occurs . In particular, pregnant women should avoid these Treatments even  a few months before conception</div>
