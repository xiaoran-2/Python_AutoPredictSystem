    <h1>Submission 441 from Anon (session_user_id: 370065e074b5ba2a9bd7032018f7a4a82264583e)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to a class of drugs known as hypomethylating agents, which reduce epigenetic methylation marks. Decitabine inhibits the gene expression of DNA methyltransferases, enzymes involved in methylating DNA. One such DNA methyltransferases is known as DNMT1. Reducing methylation can suppress tumor growth in some cancers where inappropriate cancer related excess or hypermethylation has led to the silencing of tumor suppressor genes, allowing cancer to grow unchecked. Reducing methylation allows these genes to reexpress, and then resume attacking tumorous growth. Global untargetted hypomethylation is not a panacea though because globally reduced methylation also results in fewer methylation marks in intergenic areas where methylation marks work to silence repeats, which are problematic DNA sequences that if left unrepressed by methylation can lead to DNA mutations such as deletions, inserts and transpositions. Therefore it's necessary to carefully evaluate the particular form of cancer involved before using a hypomethylation or hypermethylation agent.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p></p><p>CpG islands are genetic regions found near gene promoters that have higher than chance clusters of C-G dinucleotides. Gene promoters are sequences to which transcription factors bind to the DNA, allowing transcription machinery to copy or transcribe the gene, as part of gene expression. CpG islands can receive epigenetic methylation marks which block transcription and reduce gene expression. In normal cells CpG islands are usually unmethylated, but in cancerous cells CpG islands are much more likely to be methylated. The methods by which this starts in cancer are as yet unknown, but the results are well known: Genes related to tumor suppression, which search out and destroy rogue cancerous cells (which are growing when they shouldn't be), are silenced, resulting in cancer. This is not the only factor involved in cancer, but is part of a chain of events that can lead to cancer. High methylation of CpG islands has been observed in nearly all cancers. This makes sense because for cancer to grow, the antitumor functions of the genome must be disabled somehow.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions of the genome often contain many repeats, which are genetic patterns that appear frequently in the DNA, often because they are rogue DNA that makes copies of itself that are reinserted in the genome, wrecking mutation havoc such as transpositions, deletions and insertions. In normal DNA, these sequences are methylated, silencing them and keeping them out of trouble. In cancerous cells, these regions have less methylation than normal, which allows repeats to get out and cause genome mutations, increasing the chances of further defective and multiplying, cancerous cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is an imprinted gene, meaning differential methylation based on the parent contributing to each allele. On the unmethylated maternal allele, this cluster has a binding site for insulator protein CTCF which stiffens the chromatin, preventing bending that allows enhancers downstream to fold over and activate the Igf2 gene. The enhancers instead bind to the secondary site, H19.</p>
<p>The paternally expressed allele has the CTCF binding site methylated, allowing the chromatin to remain flexible, and enhancers fold around and augment Igf2's gene expression on the paternal side. The methylation also extends to the CpG island on the H19 gene's promoter, preventing expression of H19.</p>
<p>Excess methylation associated with cancer can cause the maternal allele to behave as the paternal one, basically causing Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome, doubling (upregulating) the expression of Igf2. As Igf2 is a growth promoting gene, this has an oncogenic or cancerous effect, and can lead to Wilm's tumour, a childhood kidney tumor in those who have this as an imprinting disorder. Furthermore, Cdkn1c a growth supressor is active on the unmethylated maternal allele and is inactive on the paternal, having two paternal alleles cuses it to be totally inactive and disables its tumor supressant effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation marks are copied during mitosis (cell division) by enzymes such as DNMT1 and are thus mitotically heritable. This means that alterations to DNA methylation survive mitosis and are propogated throughout cell division and growth. These can effect more permanent changes than the effects of drugs that cause an effect only while the drug is active in the bloodstream.</p>
<p>One concern is sensitive periods, which are the time during pre-implantation development and germ cell development, both very early in a pregnancy when methylation marks of genes are stripped, though intergenetic repeats are left intact. Epigenetic drugs that modify methylation globally could have catastrophic long term effects on the embryo. This can not be proven in humans using ethical experiments, but is a likely and plausible risk based on the known mechanics of the drugs and the methylation curves of early development and therefore these drugs should be avoided during early pregnancy.</p></div>
