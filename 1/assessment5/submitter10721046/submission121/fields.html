    <div class="field-value">As a general rule, in normal cells there is a higher overall methylation of the genome, but an hypomethylation of CpG islands, wether in cancer, the opposite is the rule.<br />In normal cells, CpG islands are hypomethylated, which usually mean that the genes found nearby are expressed. In cancer, these island became increasingly methylated, and the corresponding genes are silenced. These genes are usually associated with tumor supressor genes, implying that their inactivation allows the unregulated growth of cells, which is one of the hallmarks of cancer.<br />On a normal cell great extensions of the genome are methylated, including the repetitive elements, the intergenic regions and the introns between genes. These epigenetic marks confer great stability to the genome.<br />In cancer, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements became hypomethylated. These changes do have many consequences: the activation of transposable elements, that jump from one point of the genome to another, causing potentially dire consequences on gene activity, and the increasing possibility of genome wide changes, as deletions, insertions or reciprocal translocations between different chromosomes.<br />These general disruption in the methylation pattern in a cancer cell decreases the genome stability and is a hallmark of cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The H19/Igf2 cluster is located in an imprinted region of the genome, where the paternal allele imprinted control region (ICR) is methylated, thus allowing the gene enhancers to act on Igf2, allowing its expression. On the other hand, the maternal allele ICR is not methylated, allowing the protein CTCF to bind to that locus, blocking the effect of the enhances, thus, silencing the expression of Igf2.<br />In the case of Wilm's tumor, it has been found that both ICR, paternal and maternal, are methylated. This situation does not allow CTCF protein to bind the ICR, thereby allowing the enhances to act on both Igf2 genes ( from the maternal chromosome and from the paternal chromosome), increasing the expression of Igf2.<br />Usually genes controlled by imprinting regions are related to growth, and in this case, the over expression of Igf2 could be in some part responsable for the tumor growth.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the article Decitabine is described as a DNA-demethylating agent, sold commercially as Dacogen, and used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.<br />As a matter of fact, this drug is a DNA methyl transferase (DNMT) inhibitor, because its chemical structure is analogue to cytidine, but when it binds to the enzyme, it blocks it permanently. Thus, when the cell divides, the DNMT cannot methylate the "daughter" strand of DNA, producing a progressive demethylation of the DNA.<br />As it has been seen in cancer, the methylation of some specific CpG islands contribute to the silencing of tumor supressor genes. For this reason, inducing a demethylation of this sites might activate these supressor genes, thereby, showing an anti-tumour effect.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The article describes the work of Dr. Baylin using a combination of histone deacetylase inhibitors and azacitidine, which is a DNA methytransferase inhibitor. Both these drugs act on the epigenome of the cell, producing changes that are mitotically maintained. Is possible to suppose that by increasing the acetylation of the DNA, and reducing the methylation of it, the DNA would be "more exposed", allowing standard chemotherapeutic drugs to act in a more efficient way.<br />A sensitive period is defined as the time when the epigenetic marks are established in the genome, and normally, they occur when the gametes are formed (imprint marks are laid down, among others) and during embryogenesis, while differentiation is happening.<br />If patients are treated with epigenetic drugs during the above mentioned sensible periods, the epigenome would be altered, and thus, genetic expression would be changed, in the gametes or in the embryo, if the patient is a pregnant mother.<br /><br /></div>
