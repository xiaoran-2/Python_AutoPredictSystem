    <h1>Submission 606 from Anon (session_user_id: 5c22162805553df9410223402e67f498bf5a1293)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normally, the DNA methylation is focused on intergenic and repetitive parts of DNA in order to avoid DNA damage and other cancer-specific actions. In cancer cells, the methylation is linked to silence CpG islands and shores (the areas with CpG marks and loci around them), which promote tumour suppressing. Likewise, intergenic and repetitive elements are not often not methylated in many cancer cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Hypermethylation of the maternal allele of H19 gene can result in tumours. In a normal cell, the paternal cell is methylated and thus silenced, but the maternal allele is responsible for cell growth maintenance. H19, which is responsible for suppressing the Igf2 gene, is a key contributor for avoiding tumours, such as Wilm's. Hypermethylation of both alleles, paternal and maternal results in aberrant cell growth.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decibatine is sold as a demethylating agent that removes DNA methylation. DNA methylation on certain CpG islands and shores can result in suppressing anti-tumorous genes. When DNA of the promoters of these genes is not methylated, normal cell growth maintenance functions exist. In case of methylation, the expression of anti-tumor genes is suppressed, promoting cancer phenotype.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation, which is linked to many cancers, is preserved mitotically, meaning that once DNA methylation marks are fixed, they do not return in somatic cells. DNA methylation marks are reprogrammed only in so-called sensitive periods, which occur only when sperm and oocytes are formed and in early stage embroy development. The interruptions caused by medicine could cause mistakes during the normal reprogramming, therefore treating patiens during these stages is not advised.</div>
