    <div class="field-value">                In normal
cells, DNA methylation  assures the
proper regulation of gene expression and stable gene silencing. DNA
methylation is also  linked with histone
modifications and together these
epigenetic modifications  regulate the
functioning of the genome by changing chromatin architecture. Any epigenetic changes in  normal DNA methylation pattern (hypermethylation or hypomethylation)  results in cancer onset or its
progression.<br />              DNA methylation primarily occurs at cytosine- guanosine dinucleotides (CpGs). CpG sites are found in low frequency throughout the genome and occur more frequently as CpG islands in about 60% of gene promoters. These CpG islands are usually unmethylated. However, in cancer cells these CpG islands become hypermethylated and cause silencing of the genes they surround. The silenced genes often include tumour-suppressing genes that check uncontrolled growth of cells that happens in cancer. <br />              About  45% of human genome consists of interspersed repetitive elements such as LINE and SINE. Some of these repeats especially LINE sequences are also active retrotransposons that can induce mutations by insertiion near or within genes and recombination between non allelic repeats. In normal cells, these elements are heavily methlyated to repress their expression as these may be dangerous if expressed. However, in cancer cells these  elements are found to be hypomethylated and contribute to genomic instability and tumour progression. Moreover, several functional genes contain retrotransposons within their introns and their active transcription may interfere with normal expression of the host gene. <br />               Thus, it can be concluded that epigenitic defects such as changes in DNA methylation patterns play a significant role in cancer onset or its progression.n </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>           In mammals certain genes known as imprinted genes show monoallelic gene expression. These genes are marked with their parental
origin.  DNA methylation plays an important role
in marking of parental alleles. One such example is Igf2/H19 gene cluster
located on human chromosome 11. D</span>ifferentially methylated region (DMR) located upstream of H19 controls the parent-specific genomic
imprinting of both the <i>IGF2</i> and <i>H19</i> genes. Both the genes also share
enhancers located downstream of H19. In normal cells, H19 is only transcribed from the maternally inherited allele while Igf2 is paternally expressed. On the
maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated  and allows 
binding of CTCF insulator protein.This insulates  Igf2 
from the shared downstream enhancers and therefore Igf2 remains
unexpressed from the maternal  chromosome. However, DNA methylation at ICR
blocks the binding site of CTCF protein. In the absence of CTCF, DNA  methylation spread to the H19 promoter thereby
silencing the H19 gene. The enhancers
can now access Igf2, thus activating the gene. </p><p>         Wilm's tumour and other type of cancers result from loss of imprinting due to abnormal methylation of DMR upstream of the
maternal copy of<span> <i>H19 </i></span>. This activates maternal copy of Igf2 gene resulting in uniparental disomy and overexpression of Igf2. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">        Many types of cancers are caused due to an increase in DNA methylation..The  hypermethylation of DNA  silences tumour suppressor genes  that regulate cell division and growth. When suppressor genes are silent, cell division becomes unregulated, causing cancer. This happens because, unlike the normal cells which receive and respond to signals from tumour suppressor genes to stop making their copies, cancer cells in absence of signal continue to replicate and divide. Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. It inhibits DNA methyltransferase. Decitabine works by demethylation or interfering with the methylation of DNA.  By this process of demethylation, normal function to the tumor suppressor genes is restored, thus restoring control over cell growth.  <p><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">         Epigenetic drugs alter the pattern of abnormal DNA methylation in cancer. Epigenetic changes are mitotically inheritable and are passed on to the subsequent generations of cells during cell division until they are actively erased. Therefore, such drugs that alter DNA methylation have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment and can stop cancer progression without killing all its cells. Periods of epigenetic reprogramming during which clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks occur, that is, germ cell development and early development (gestation period and new born offspring) are sensitive periods. Exposure to epigenetic altering cancer drugs at this stage would result in alterations or removal of normal epigenetic process resulting in epigenetic abnormalities. </div>
