    <h1>Submission 277 from Anon (session_user_id: 6017d22c27b7feee64acad09c928208124884a78)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">1.D<b></b>ecitabine (dacogene) is anti-tumour drug which is inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase1. DECITABINE IS HYPOMETHYLATION AGENT<br />2. DNA methyltransferases are enzymes which are involved in the process of DNA methylation. Methylation of DNA is epigenetic mark, during it promoters of genes are methylated in CpG meC islands and gene expression is locked. The other epigenetic mark of DNA nucleotides is also CH3 group  is also  mark for reparation enzymesDecitabine inhibits methylation of DNA, blocking DNAMT 1 which is maintaining  enzyme and recruits methylation of daughter strand  in DNA<br />3. Decitabine is hipomethylating agent, causes apoptosis. As DNAMT1 is maintaining  methyltransferase, methylates newly synthesized strand during DNA replication, this methylation contributes to reparation of mutations in restriction points of S phase (mitosis). In tumour cells inhibition with decitabine hypomethylates daughter strand of DNA  and mitosis blocks on this phase consequently blocks tumour cell proliferation and induces cell death, because reparation is impossible.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><br />1.In normal cells  CpG islands of tumour suppressors are not methylated and they have high levels of expression because of  transcription occur and genes are transcribed. <br />2.In cancer cells we observe appearance of strong methylation in CpG islands  and consequently loss of suppressor and protooncogenes expresion. This methylation is rapidly selected and mitotically heritable, which helps to cancer cells to be spread and divided out of control without apoptosis activation. Protooncogene reverses to oncogene.<br />3. CpG islands are in contents of promoters  in different genes. For normal cell is very important to have regular expression of suppresors and protooncogenes . All they are transcribed from non -methylated promoters, their methylation stops expression ,leads to cancer development and loss of apoptosis.Alteration of methylation patterns can lead to cancer, different types of tumours are likely to show up or down regulation of particular genes which can become specific biomarkers in diagnostics. In normal cells are present two groups of genes that regulate normal cell growth, division and cell death. Disruption of cell cycle leads to cancer. This genes are protooncogenes and suppresors . Both are inhibitors of tumour development. Expression levels of them can alter genetically through mutation and epigenetically through methylation acethy,ation ,histone modification e t.c.<br />4. Repeatitive elements and intergenic regions are methylated in normal cells <br />5. At CpG islands of repetitive elements,intergenic regions, CpG poor promoters, ICR they are hypomethylated in cancer cells<br />6. Such alteration  of methylation in cancer cell can lead Illegitimate recombination between repeats, transposition. Such kind of insertions cause  incorrent transcription and translation of mutated genes.  This jumping elements can be transported to significant sequence  of DNA coding protein and mutation occurs.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">H19/ Igf 2 cluster has common imprint control region which is methylated on paternal allele and non methylated  on maternal. It seems that methylation of ICR in cluster leads to inactivation of both genes but it is mistake.<br />In the cluster is present enhancer which enhances either  Igf 2 or H19 expression.<br />1. On paternal allele ICR is methylated and protein factor CTCF protein cant bind it, enhancer provides Igf 2 expression, when  H19 isnt expressed. These genes are imprinted .<br />2.On maternal allele ICR isnt methylated so CTCF  binds ICR, enhancer provides H19 expression , when Igf 2 isnt expressed.<br />As somatic cell has both maternal and paternal alleles, from each allele is expressed only one gene, monoparental expression but when occurs disorder monoparental dysomy (imprint disorder)  takes place process of expression of only one gene . Wilms tumour is tumour of kidneys-embryonic cancer of kidneys that is subsequent of Wiedemann Beckwits syndrome it is Unipaternal disomy when we have only two paternal alleles . Here we have  overexpression of  Igf 2 gene from paternal allele and loss of Cdkn1c protein.<br /><br />4. Igf 2 is oncogene, promotes growth in increased concentration, Cdkn1c is tumour supressor, in such conditions we have cancer development.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"> Hypomethylating genome by inhibiting of methyltransferases we give an opportunity to suppressors which were been locked to be expressed and suppress tumour if expression of suppressors is blocked epigenetically. But in the same time we hipomethylate cell genome wide and it can increase frequency of mutations<br /><strong></strong>Sensitive periods begin after restriction points in interphase. So tumour is sustainable in the period of hyperplasia when takes place high frequency of mitotic divisions. In the period of accumulation of mutations and low frequency of divisions is not so effective.</div>
