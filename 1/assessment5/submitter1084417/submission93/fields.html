    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation of CpG islands silences gene expression and normally associated with gene imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, and genome stability in general.<br />In cancer, CpG islands are hypermethylated, which disrupts the normal development of cells.  Hypermethylation is associated with gene silencing and can lead to silencing of tumor suppressor genes.  Silencing of tumor suppressor genes reduces tumor inhibition.<br />Normally, one of the functions of internecine regions is to control nearby genes by way of coded promotors and enhancers and the methylation of these.<br />In intergenic regions, hypomethylation tends to occur, which is associated with progression of tumor cells. Hypomethylation of these regions leads to genomic instability and can promote tumor growth.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">On the paternal allele, DNA methylation at the ICR blocks binding of CTCF, which a allows H19 promotors to be methylated.  This in turn allows enhancers access to Igf2 and increases Igf2 expression.<br />On the maternal allele, DNA methylation suppresses Igf2 expression.<br />In cancer, hypermethylation of ICR on the maternal allele results in Igf2 overexpression (a double dose) in Wilm's tumor.  Igf2 is a growth promoting hormone.  Thus loss of imprinting contributes to cancer.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-methylating agent or hypomethylating agent and and does so by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase.<br />Inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, which causes DNA hypomethylation, prevents DNA synthesis and thus has an anti-tumor effect.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have an enduring effect beyond drug treatment since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable.  A sensitive period is a period of time when the epigenetic state is most susceptible to the environment, which includes these drugs.  Epigenetic reprogramming during germ cell development and embryonic development are two such sensitive periods.  Treatment during sensitive periods may lead to problems such as imprinting disorders and other epigenetic abnormalities.</div>
