    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value">Normally DNA methylation at CpG islands is associated with gene silencing. In cancer, there is hypermethylation of CpG islands by virtue of long noncoding RNA that binds PRC-2 leading to methylation of histone variants associated with inactivation H3K27 &amp; H3K9. This results in silencing of Tumor Suppressor Genes increasing susceptibility to cancer. Intergenic regions of DNA and repetitive elements (IAPs) are associated with genomic instability, transposons. and oncogene promoters, therefore these regions are normally methylated. In cancer ,however, methylation is disrupted by turning off DNMT enzyme which leads to overexpression of the oncogenes and cancer eventually. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The paternal allele ICR at IGF2 is usually methylated by way of silencing histone marks H3K9me and H3K27me allowing promoters to reach enhancer and hence expressing Igf2 with no CTCF insulation. Whereas the maternal allele ICR is usually unmethylated thanks to CTCF binding which confers an insulator protein blocking access of promoters to enhancers leading to failure of expression of IGF2 finally.<br />In Wilm's tumor the maternal allele takes a paternal-like pattern as regards IGF2 expression due to loss of imprinting so IGF2 promoters can reach enhancers and expression takes place while H19 is switched off. H19 normally restricts growth and Igf2 is a growth factor, in order not to develop cancer just one copy of each should be expressed while the other silenced. In cancer H19 is silenced on the maternal in addition to the already silenced paternal allele whereas Igf2 is now double-expressed leading to cancer.<br /><a href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2011/02/04/hmg.ddr018.full.pdf" title="Link: http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2011/02/04/hmg.ddr018.full.pdf">http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2011/02/04/hmg.ddr018.full.pdf</a> <br /><a href="http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/genomic-imprinting-and-patterns-of-disease-inheritance-899" title="Link: http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/genomic-imprinting-and-patterns-of-disease-inheritance-899">http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/genomic-imprinting-and-patterns-of-disease-inheritance-899</a><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a demethylating agent which cuts down DNA methylation. It removes methyl group from CpG islands allowing Tumor Suppressor Genes to be expressed and therefore treat cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation by blocking enzymes such as DNMT or treating with demethylating agents can result in re-expression of tumor suppressor genes again with lasting effect on the epigenetics as it might be passed down through the generations sperm or egg at sensitive periods of mark resetting. A sensitive period is a time when epigenetic marks are being reset in gametocytes such as Early embryonic development ( gestation period ) &amp; late gameto-genesis. It's inadvisable to treat patients during these periods as it may come to change their epigenetic having negative effects on their development and their future off-springs.<br /><br /></div>
