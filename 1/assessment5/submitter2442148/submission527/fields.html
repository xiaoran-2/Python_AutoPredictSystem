    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><br />thDNA in healthy tissue is normally methylated in the in the intergenic regions and repetetive elements and unmethylated in the CpG islands. Wheras when the DNA is disrupted by cancer there happens a swap, and the CpG islands gets methylated and the intergenic regions and repetitive elements gets unmethylated.<br />By methylating the CpG islands the gene expression of that gene will be shut down and silenced, wheras when unmethylating the intergenic regions and repetetive elements the DNA strand becomes open and these areas can be read, and for instance the repetetive elements can jump around and cause interuptions in the chromosomes like insertions, deletions and translocations. Which is why theese areas are normally silenced as the insertions, deletions and translocations cause genomic instabillty and can cause malfunctions in the normal gene expression, and could lead to or disturb expression of imprinted genes, and express oncogenes, and silencing growth suppressor genes.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The H19/lgf2 cluster is a paternal imprinted gene, which means on the paternel allele the ICR (inprinted control region) is methylated and unmethylated on the matenal allele. which means, on the maternel allele, the long non coding (lncRNA) H19 is expressed because the unmethylated ICR binds a protein which insulates and therefore prevents the enhancers to express the lgf2 gene, which is considered to be the enchancers preferred loop. And therefore on the paternal allele the ICR is methylated and therefore do not bind the protein and the enchancers can use the prefered loop and express lgf2. As lgf2 is considered a a oncogene a growth promoting gene, having both alleles active for lgf2 could present a problem.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decapatine belongs to the class of DNM1 inhibitors.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">A sensitive period is when the cells are reprogramming, which happens in two waves, the first just before the implantation, and the second reprogramming happens in the mid gestation.</div>
