    <h1>Submission 420 from Anon (session_user_id: a9d2866295777948e63d5a9c6d8bd6c5096a2799)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs which cause the de-methylation of previously methylated DNA can act either actively or passively. Passive de-methylation results in the reduction of this epigenetic mark over each subsequent round of cell division, either when DNMT1 is not expressed or not present within the nucleus.<br />Active DNA de-methylation, shown to occur in the year 2000, occurs without the need for DNA replication and is an active process, employing enzymatic removal and involving TET proteins plus AID.  <br />Like DNA methylation it is mitotically heritable and can be therefore transmitted to daughter cells. During sensitive periods, in which the genome undergoes epigenetic reprogramming, such as primordial germ cell and early embryonic development, these stable epigenetic marks are erased to restore totipotency.Treatment of individuals with drugs which promote the alteration of these epigenetic marks within these sensitive periods would not be advisable as the de-methylation of the cancer cell's genome could not be inherited, possibly causing cancer in the next generation. <br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Recently, a completely new approach to cancer therapy  has involved targeting the epigenetic machinery itself .This maybe used alone or in conjunction with more traditional pharmaceutical agents to cure malignancies. <br />Decitabine, an FDA approved DNMT inhibitor, acts upon regions of previously heavily methylated DNA such as in CpG islands where methylation is laid down by methytransferases. CpG island methylation is indicative of a poor prognosis for myelodysplastic syndrome for which this drug is approved for. <br />Nucleoside analogues such as Decitabine, irreversibly bind to DNMT after their incorporation into the DNA and are cell division dependent, therefore, cancer cells are more severely affected as they divide at a more rapid rate. Administration of this drug results in low doses causes DNA de-methylation and kills cancer cells.<br />Scientists do not yet know the long term consequences of this drug on normal cells or the precise mode of action for this drug.      </div>

    <div class="field-value">Cancer is the result of uncontrolled cell division, brought about by a combination of genetic and epigenetic alterations. DNA methylation is an example of an epi mutation which occurs when the 5' position of the cytosine base is modified. This phenomenon, although mutagenic, is found in approximately 70-80% of CpG  di- nucleotides in somatic mammalian cells. Hassler <em>et al .<br /></em>DNA methylation occurs via an enzymatic reaction involving methyltransferase enzymes notably DNMT3a and DNMT 3b in mammals. this epigenetic mark is symmetrical and stable due to the activity of DNMT1.<br />In a non malignant situation, there is differential methylation with respect to the different components of the a gene. CpG's are usually clustered into islands and are protected from methylation. If  methylation were to occur here, it would result in gene silencing.<br />Intergenic areas are on the other hand usually methylated to maintain integrity and prevent genomic instability. Repetitive elements are also methylated in order to preserve genomic integrity by a wide variety of mechanisms.<br />Whilst malignancy causes a general hypomethylation  within the genome, CpG islands become  hypermethylated, silencing tumour supressor genes such as P53 causing cell proliferation. intergenic regions become hypomethylated  and may allow deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations  leading to genomic instability which is a hallmark of cancer.<br /> Hypomethylation of repeats contributes to malignancy by permitting transposition, transcriptional interference and illegitimate recombination.<br />CpG island  hypermethylation is used as a biomarker aiding diagnosis, prognosis  and treatment of cancers However it should be stressed that  the role of DNA methylation in cancer is context dependent as different tumours exhibit different dependencies and are stage spesific. <br />            <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprinted genes exist within clusters, each of which contains their own ICR.  Disorders may arise when these clusters are disrupted for example in the case of Beckwith Wiedermann syndrome. The two clusters of significance here are the Kcnq-1 and the nearby H19/ Igf2, both which are situated on human chromosome11. the most important gene in the Kcnq-1 cluster is the Cdkn 1c gene which is maternally expressed and is a tumour supressor  gene.<br />The H19/Igf2 cluster is paternally imprinted. H19, a long non coding RNA, is produced from the maternal allele only, and here, the ICR is unmethylated and bound by an insulator protein called CTCF which serves to insulate Igf2 from downstream enhancers. these enhancers may now act on H19 and enhance expression on the maternal allele, possibly by chromatin looping. <br />On the paternal allele, CTCF may no longer bind and enhancers may now bind Igf2 from this allele due to hererochromatin spreading.<br />Beckwith Wiedermann syndrome results in the appearance of two paternal alleles, due to hypermethylation of the maternal allele leading to  up regulation of Igf2 oncogene, a growth promotor and loss of Cdkn 1c expression, a tumour supressor resulting in embryonic kidney tumours such as Wilm's tumour.</div>
