    <h1>Submission 590 from Anon (session_user_id: 7ddfd92f059321fbcbdb11da5fc81547338b3783)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">These are systemic drugs, meaning that every cell in the body is potentially a target for them. Younger patients with developing germ cells need to be specially kept under medical control because during very large insults to the epigenetic machinery can have negative effects.<br />Germ cell formation (reprogramming, cell imprinting) and early life constitute periods with an increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms, mainly because altered methylation patterns can be associated with disease.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In general terms, in cancer hypomethylation is found genome-wide (introns, repetitive elements, intergeneric regions) and hypermethylation specially in CpG island and tumor suppressor genes. <br />DNA methylation at CpG islands correlates indirectly with gene expression. When a gene is highly methylated, it is then silenced. In cancer, DNA methylation is an alternative to silence tumor suppressor genes. <br />On the contrary, in normal cells intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated to maintain genomic stability, for example, avoiding illegitimate recombination between repeats. If these regions are not methylated, as in cancer, these repeats are not packed and can align because of the homology of the sequence. When these regions are not methylated genomic instability occurs leading to deletions, translocations, insertions, activation of transposons or activation of cryptic promoters. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cells the paternal allele CTCF is methylated and the enhancers downstream can't act on it (leading to no expression of H19). In this context the enhancers can act directly on Igf2.In normal cells  the maternal allele, CTCF is NOT methylated and the enhancers downstream  act on it leading to H19 expression. In Wilm's tumor imprinting is lost and one gene that should have mono allelic expression has biallelic expression. In these paeditric type of tumor you can find hypermethylation of the promoter in the maternal allele. Then,  cells have then double dose of Igf2, that is a growth promoting gene.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is an epigenetic drug that acts as a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi). It acts as a nucleoside analogue. Therefore, during replication, when DNMT acts upon the DNA daughter strand it to copy it can not be methylated. This drug is replication dependent and this epigenetic change will then be passed through the following generations of cells. <br />Changing methylation pattern can alter the activation status of certain genes. For example: Tumor suppressor genes are usually hypermethylated in cancer. When decitabine inhibits DNMT, methylation levels decrease and tumor growth is the suppressed. </div>
