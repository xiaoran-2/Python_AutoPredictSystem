    <div class="field-value">CpG island are often found in a 60% promotor regions and mostly they are kept to be unmethylated independent of their activity state. However they found to be hypermethylated in several types of cancer. This methylation is progressing with time and stage if the desease. CpG islands in tumor supressor genes promoter are found more often, which would explain the contribution of CpG hypermethilation in cancer. Methylation of CpG and surrounding region in this case will lead to loss of expression of tumor supressor gene and will give survival advantage to the tumor cells. CpG island methylation phenotype has been proven to be useful for tumor types and stage classification and also could be used as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis (GSTP1 for proatate canser, for example), prognosis or informed treatment (MGMT methylaletion in glioma). <br />On another hand time <span>intergenic regions and repetitive elements are supposed to be silenced and methyled in a normal cell. Methylation of this regiond prevent cells from inapropriate chomosomal recombination. But this regions were shown to be rather hypomethilated in cancer. Hypomethylation of this region leads to recombination between repeats, activation of transposones, activation of cryptic promoters and distribution of the activation to the neigbouring genes. All this provides a base for chomosomal instability, which then can lead to cancer. </span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Loss if imprinting can contribute to cancer as well and H19/Igf2 cluster is a good example of it. The maternally-expressed H19 gene and paternally-expressed Igf2 gene share enhancers and activity of the genes depends on ICR insulator between the genes.<br />On maternal allele stays unmethylated and can be bound by CTCF (insulator protein). This binding prevents enhansers interaction with Igr2 promoter, which will be the first-priority intersaction for this region. Because first-priority interaction is no longer possible, enhancers react with H19, allowing it's expression. <br />Situation is different in paternal allele. In this case ICR is methilated, so in is no binding with CTCF. Therefore, it is no "distraction" for the enhancer, which now can reach Igf2 allowing it's expression. H19 is, on another hand, methylated due to heterochromatin spreading and, therefore, silenced.<br />In Wilm’s tumour a case of uniparental disomy can be observed. Cellsend up having to paternal-like alleles, which means that they have two times more <span>Igf2 gene expression. Igf2 gene is responsible for cell growth and it is known to be an oncogene. Overexpression of it will lead to cancer.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Decitabine belongs to DNA methyltranspherase inhibitor and it is FDA approved drug for myelodisplastic syndrome treatment. It is a small molecule, with binds to DNA irreversibly, therefore making copying of DNA methylation to the daugter strand during cell division impossible. the effect is dose-dependent and the drug is more specific in a lover dosage, causing DNA demethylation. This drug effects dividing cells and because, cancer cells proliferate more, then other cells in a human body, they will be effected the most. It does kill tumors, because some og the tumors rely on DNA methylation of CpG island and it is really important for tumor development.<br /></span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs, that alter DNA methylation, althought they are tolerated quite good and believed to be specific enought, effect all the cells of the body to some extend, causing long-term side effects, especially being used within sensitive periods.  <br />Sensitive period is a period when epigenetic marks are settled and therefore cells are much more vulnerable to environmental influences.  Time during germ cell development, development in maternal passages ans early childhood (time chortly after birth) are those sensitive perionds.  Epigenetic marks that are established in this periods will be kept then trough whole life time effecting development of the organizm. Using grugs, that alter DNA methylation will disturb mormal development and will definetelly cause lots of abnormalities, which probably can not be easely predicted. Therefore the use of the gruds for younger patients and during germ cells development should be done with a great awareness.<br /><span><br /><br /></span></div>
