    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to control the expression of genes. In cancer, these CpG islands are hypermethylated. When tumor suppressor genes are hypermethylated in cancer cells, the are not expressed and thus can't stop the cancer.<br />The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to suppress these genes. In cancer, these regions are less methylated (= hypomethylated) and this can lead to a decreased genome stability.<span class="_wysihtml5-temp"></span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the paternal allele, H19 promoter region is methylated and this H19 gene is not expressed. The Igf2 gene is expressed.<br />In the maternal allele, the H19 promoter region is not methylated and thus, the H19 gene is expressed and the formed CTCF blocks the expression of the Igf2 gene. In Wilm's tumor, both alleles have paternal expression motif meaning that the H19 promoter region is methylated and the H19 gene can't be expressed. Thus, the Igf2 gene is expressed. This can lead to a loss of growth restricting genes and an overexpression of growth enhancing genes.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the class of DNMT inhibitors. Decitabine binds as nucleoside analogue to DNMT and blocks it. Thus, it blocks the hypermethylation of the genome in cancer cells which otherwise could lead to an suppression of the expression of cancer suppression genes in cancer cells.<span class="_wysihtml5-temp"></span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The altered DNA methylation changes the epigenetic state of the genome and can be transferred to the daughter cells by DNMT. Thus, the epigenetic state is maintained and has also lasting effects which don't occur if the epigenetic state is not transferred to the daughter cells and maintained. A sensitive period is a period of time when the epigenetic state of parts of the genome is altered in large parts of all cells. In these sensitive periods, the old epigenetic marks are removed and new marks are added to the genomes of the cells. During the development, there are two sensitive periods: During the epigenetic reprogramming of the somatic cells and during the epigenetic reprogramming of the germ cells (in the oocytes). Both periods occur in the development of the child during the mother's pregnancy.<br />Drugs that affect the epigenome and/or the transfer of this epigenome to other cells can also alter the epigenetic reprogramming that occurs during the sensitive periods. When this reprogramming is influenced by such drugs, the resulting epigenome can have undesired changes and the development of the child can be negatively influenced. When a drug blocks DNMT, then DNMT also doesn't work during these sensitive periods </div>
