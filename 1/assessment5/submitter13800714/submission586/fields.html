    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Disruption of imprinting contributes to cancer. The upstream element of the maternal H19 gene is unmethylated and this attracts the CTCF to bind to the unmethylated sequene and thereby the enhancers can enhance the expression of the H19 gene in the case of maternal allele. Whereas the paternally, the H19 gene is imprinted due to the methylation at the upstream elements of H19 leading to the expression of only the Igf2 gene. So Igf2 is expressed only in the paternal allele while it is imprinted in the maternal allele. In the case of Wilm's tumour, there is no methylation at the Imprint control regions(ICR) in the case of maternal allele. So this leads to the lack of binding of the CTCF which inturn leads to improper imprinting and the expression of Ig2 from the maternal allele also. Since Igf2 is associated with growth, this leads to abnormal growth resulting in Wilm's tumour. Hence the disruption of the imprinting in this H19/Igf2 cluster can lead to cancer since these two genes are responsible for the growth and improper imprinting leads to the occurance of cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mark which plays a role in the transcription regulation of genes. CpG islands are methylated under normall conditions and these methylation prevent the transcription of the downstream genes. Whereas in cancer, these CpG islands are hypomethylated leading to the open structure of the chromatin and thereby activating the transcription of the genes. This may result in the unwanted gene expression and crosstalk signaling in the cell leading to cancer. DNA methylation also occur in the intergenic regions and repetitive elements which ensures genomic stability by preventing excess transcription of repeptitive elements and recombination of the same. bIn cancer cells, these are found to be hypomethylated leading to genomic instablity, that is, the repetitive elements are transcribed and prone to more recombination and inturn causing deletions, or insertion at random places in the genome. Deletions might lead to deletion of certain gene or deletion of certain important promoters leading to the abnormal activation or repression of certain genes. Insertions lead to the same but this might vary the methylation pattern leading to the instability of the genome. Hence the disruptionof DNA methylation at these intergenic regions and repetitive elements lead to the occurance of cancer. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine are a member a new class of drugs that are DNA demethylating agents. These drugs act by inhibiting the DNA methylating agents and thereby preventing DNA hypermethylation in case of cancer cells. So this drug helps in reducing methylation in cancer cells and thereby restoring the normal function in the cancer cell. This does not require the killing of cancer cells, hence they rarely affect the normal cells. Decitabine has an anti-tumour effect by inhibiting DNA hypermethylation and thereby preventing the over-growth of the cells. The cancer cells actually loose their ability to divide indefinitely and leading to the retrieval of their normal function.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Standard Chemotherapy involves the less susceptibility compared to the Epigenetic drugs. Epigeentic drugs provide long term effect in the cells due to the characteristics that it is mitotically heritable. The usage of these drugs at certain stages of cancer also plays an important role. Sensitive period is defined as that time of cell growth where the DNA methylation factors mark important changes in the genome. Hence usage of drugs during sensitive periods of cancer plays an important role in their treatment. During development of cancer, CpG methylation increases as the cells continue to grow and invade, hence should be designed accordingly. Also these methylation states help in determing the stages of cancer and thereby suggesting the exact medication. It is not advisable to treat patients during sesitive period becuase we might end up in completely demethylating the region leading to long term effect. </div>
