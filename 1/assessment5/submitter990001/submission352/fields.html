    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is altered in cancer in two main ways: hypermethylation at CpG islands, and genome-wide hypomethylation, especially at intergenic and repetitive elements.<br /><br />CpG islands are frequently found in promoter regions and serve as binding sites for transcription factors. In normal cells, these islands are hypomethylated. However, in cancer, these islands are hypermethylated, silencing the promoter and therefore the underlying gene. If the underlying gene is a tumor suppressor gene, silencing it contributes to carcinogenesis by reducing its expression.<br /><br />In normal cells, CpG sites in intergenic regions and repetitive elements are often methylated, which silences transcription of unwanted gene products and repeats. Methylating repetitive elements also helps to form heterochromatin regions around those repeats, which reduces the likelihood of deleterious translocations and other genomic instabilities. <br /><br />However, in cancer, these CpG sites in intergenic regions and repetitive elements are typically hypomethylated. This deregulates transcription, both of gene products and lncRNAs, and increases genomic instability by allowing repeats to cause mischief, contributing to cancer formation.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprinted genes are often involved in growth and development. Deregulation of these genes can therefore lead to uncontrolled growth and tumorigenesis.<br /><br />As an example, let's look at the H19/Igf2 cluster. In a normal cell, the maternal allele is hypomethylated at the ICR, allowing the transcription factor CTCF to bind to it. This acts as an insulator that blocks distal enhancers from looping around to the Igf2 gene, instead retargeting them to the H19 gene. In the paternal allele, the opposite happens; the ICR is methylated and does not bind to CTCF, allowing the distal enhancers to loop around to Igf2 instead of H19. This results in expression of Igf2.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumour, the ICR on the maternal allele is also methylated, making it resemble the paternal allele. This means that both copies of Igf2, on both alleles, are being expressed, doubling the levels of Igf2. Igf2 is an oncogene that promotes growth, so enhancing its expression causes cell growth to get out of control and result in tumors.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor. The class of DNMT proteins is responsible for methylating CpG sites in the genome. By inhibiting DNMT, decitabine results in hypomethylation of the genome. This can have an anti-tumour effect as cancer cells typically show hypermethylation of CpG islands in promoter regions, causing silencing of tumor suppressor genes, as well as deregulation through hypermethylation of other regions like ICRs; blocking this hypermethylation could therefore help to reverse tumour progression.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is a stable mark that is mitotically heritable through the action of DNA methyltransferases. Therefore, changes in DNA methylation can last much longer than the actual duration of the treatment. <br /><br />We should be careful about treating patients with epigenetic drugs during sensitive periods of development. These sensitive periods refer to periods in which there is active reprogramming of the epigenome in the patient. The two main sensitive periods are 1) during the pre-implantation and early post-implantation stages of conception, where the epigenetic marks in the gametes are cleared, and 2) during primordial germ cell creation. We need to be careful about treating patients during sensitive periods as epigenetic drugs are currently non-specific – they target normal cells as well as cancer cells – and deregulating epigenetic machinery during a period of extensive epigenetic reprogramming in normal cells is likely to cause problems in those cells. For example, a woman of childbearing age on epigenetic drugs might have deregulated epigenomes in her oocytes, causing infertility or worse, deformities and diseases in her offspring.</div>
