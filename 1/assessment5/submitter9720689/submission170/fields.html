    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell, CpG islands are hypomethylated and are clustered at gene promoters, upstream of genes where transcription binds. Some of these promoters are of tumor suppression genes. CpG islands tend to be protected from methylation,  which is associated with the silencing of expression and with the formation of repressive chromatin structure. Normal function of CpG islands means low or no DNA methylation and gene expression. <br /><br />In a cancer cell, the CpG islands are more likely to be methylated than in a normal cell. As normal tissue becomes hyperplasic, then neoplasic to the eventual metastatic tissue, methylation at CpG islands progresses from hypo to hypermethylated. This means that as more and more islands are methylated, the promoters near them are silenced. For example, a tumor suppressor gene when silenced is no longer capable of suppression and the tumor cells can grow. Since dna methylation is mitotically heritable, the disruption at the islands allows  for the hallmarks of cancer mentioned in the lecture-evasion of growth suppressors, sustaining proliferative signalling, inducing angiogenesis and enabling replicature immortality. Hypermethylated CpG islands differ by tumor type.<br /><br />Normally, the repetitive elements and the intergenic regions and the introns of genes are methylated which means that expression is silenced. Many repetitive elements are dna sequences that can insert copies of themselves into new genomic locations and have been suspected in the etiology of many diseases. In cancer, as the global level of methylation decreases as you progress from normal tissue to metastatic tissue,  these repetitive elements and intragenic regions move from hyper to hypomethylated states, are  no longer silenced and are able to activate  and express. For example, if they had been suppressing an oncogene, decreasing methylation would allow activation and increased expression of cell growth, differentiation, signal transduction and mitotic signals, all possibly tumor -enhancing.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell with a H19/Igf2 cluster, the imprint control region (ICR) is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele.  When it is unmethylated,  CTCF, an insulator, will bind to the ICR which allows the enhancers to act on H19. Igf2 will be silent for the maternal allele and there is no expression. <br /><br />In the parental allele, however,  H19 is methylated so CTCF is not binding to insulate the ICR and the enhancers cannot act on H19. Igf2 is expressed.<br /><br />Cancer cells often show loss of imprinting so genes that should show monoallelic parent-of-origin specific expression now become expressed from both alleles or silent from both. This change in dna methylation can cause silencing of growth  restricting genes or over expression of growth promoting genes, especially in pre-neoplastic tissues.  <br /><br />The loss of imprinting in Wilm's tumor occurs when both maternal and paternal alleles are methylated on H19, resulting in hypermethylation of the ICR  in both alleles. With Igf2 which codes for a growth factor protein expressed from paternal and maternal alleles, twice as much protein is produced and proliferative growth promotion is a hallmark of cancer.*<br /><br />* Dr. Marnie Blewitt, Coursera epigenetics lecture 7.2</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue (a nucleoside which contains a nucleic acid analogue and a sugar) in the class of dna methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors.  These inhibitors get incorporated into the dna upon replication and are division dependent. A group of enzymes,  DNMTs catalyze the methylation of cytosine residues in newly synthesized dna by binding to the nucleotide and copying the methylation to the daughter strand, becoming irreversibly bound. So because tumor cells are dividing more rapidly than other cells, Decitabine can target them. In high doses, Decitabine is toxic but in lower doses, a good anti-neoplastic effect results in apoptosis of the tumor cells,  possibly through dna demethylation and reexpression of tumor suppression genes.  In haematological malignancy diseases like MDS which show heavy CpG island hypermethylation, Decitabine acts as a hypomethylating agent, reversing the effects of CpG island methylation, allowing reexpression of tumor suppression genes and slowing cancer growth.*</li></ul><span style="font-size:17.0480861663818px;line-height:21.9835262298584px;">*Dr. Marnie Blewitt,  Coursera epigenetics lecture 7.9</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Treatments often target dna methylation because it is mitotically heritable, which means that once changed or reversed it has enduring effects because dna methyltransferase preserves the methylation marks during mitosis. This global intervention might interfere with ordinary functions during sensitive periods.<br />Sensitive periods are the critical periods of pre-implantation development and germ cell development. These are periods of epigenetic reprogramming with the clearing amd resetting of epigenetic marks. It would be inadvisable to treat pregnant mothers or even those women intending to become pregnant as reprogramming happens in early embryonic development as well as during the primordial germ cell  period that forms male and female gametes.</div>
