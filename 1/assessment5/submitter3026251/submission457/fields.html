    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is one epigenetic mechanism that regulates the genome in mammals. In a normal cell CpG Islands are not methylated in general, and because they are in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes, the genes in these sites are expressed .CpG Islands are an exception, normally, if a promoter region is methylated the genes in the site are expressed. In cancer it has been observed that the CpG Islands of cells are methylated or hypermethylated which causes the silencing of tumor suppressor genes, this leaves the cell without protection, besides the proteins coded by these genes are important to regulate the cell cycle and apoptosis, they also participate in inhibition of metastasis; all of these changes like irregular cell cycle,no apoptosis, silencing of tumor suppressor genes, metastasis,and other disruptive changes contribute to cancer.<br />Intergenic regions have important elements like Enhancers and Promoters and they may have non-coding RNAs. DNA methylation in Intergenic regions and Repetitive Elements is crucial for chromatin organization and regulation of gene expression.  Normal cells in these regions are methylated and cancer cells are hypomethylated. Intergenic Regions have most of the cell's methyl-cytosine content and if these regions loose their methylation, transposable elements may be activated contributing to the genomic instability perceived in cancer cells. At the same time transposition of Repeats, activations, deletions, etc. can be observed, all of these abnormalities contribute to cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the process of Imprinting, only one allele, either the father's or the mother's is expressed. For instance, in the H19/Igf2 cluster of the paternal allele in a normal cell, the methylation sites located between the lgf2 and the H19 genes,are methylated, the lgf2 gene is expressed, and the H19 gene is suppressed. In the maternal allele of a normal cell, the methylation sites between the lgf2 and the H19 genes are not methylated and the lgf2 gene is not expressed but the H19 gene is expressed. When this pattern of methylation is disrupted, lets say, the sites between lgf2 and H19 are methylated (imprinted) in both alleles, the paternal and the maternal, the two lgf2 genes are expressed and this causes cell growth without control because the two alleles of the growth suppressor gene H19 are silenced, this disruption leads to tumorigenesis and  contributes to cancer like in Wilms' tumor.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a demethylating and anti-metabolite drug. It demethylates DNA allowing the expression of suppressor genes and in this way normalizing cell growth and division. As an anti-metabolite agent, Decitabine kills cancer cells because it has a cytotoxic effect. This drug has an anti-tumor effect because of its demethylating action on DNA which allows tumor suppressor genes to be expressed and also destroying cancer cells which form tumors.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Some drugs used for the treatment of cancer alter the epigenetic machinery changing DNA methylation patterns,for instance. During cell division these changes are passed to daughter cells and from there to grand-daughter cells, in other words the effects of these drugs continue beyond the period of treatment. There are concerns related to the use of these drugs in pregnant women because they can affect the fetus who is in a sensitive period, he or she is developing. There are also concerns of using these kind of drugs in very young children because the germ cells can be affected. Early childhood is also considered a sensitive period because it is a period of development when the organism is more susceptible to changes not only in the external  environment but also in its internal environment, which is the case with this kind of drugs.<br /><br />  Note.  In all the parts of this work the recommended readings, the notes from the lectures and Wikipedia have been used.<br /></div>
