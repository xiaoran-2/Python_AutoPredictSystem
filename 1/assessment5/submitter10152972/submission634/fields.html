    <div class="field-value"><span></span><p>   CpG isands usually are protected from methylation. When methylation occurs, it's associated to gene silencing. Methylation is an inactive epigentic mark. X inactivation is one such example of a normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands. Furthermore, methylation at CpG islands helps in controlling the transcription of DNA via the binding of MeCP proteins and their possession of 'transcriptional possession domain.' This causes the condensing of the chromatin used to withhold gene expression. Additionally, methyalation of CpG islands can alter gene expression by blocking particular transcription factor binding sites.</p>
<p>    CpG islands usually increase in methyalation when cancer starts genome disruption, e.g. in the BRCA1 gene in breast cancer (as opposed to genetic mutation). Generally, hypermethylation of CpG islands associated with tumour suppressors is the most common hypermethylation found in tumour cells. CpG islands are mostly at promoters of genes, particularly in tumour suppressor genes. Therefore, cancer cells methylate and thus silence the tumour suppressors to allow cancer progression. Cancer also alters DNA methylation by increasing methylation of CpG island shores and overall can produce CIMP.</p>
<p>    Intergenic regions are usually methylated. This provides the function of genomic integrity. Methylation also allows some silencing of expression via cryptic promoters and mediation of RNA polymerase. DNA methylation in repetitive elements also provides genomic stability by preventing transposition, illegitimate recombination (via condensed chromatin) and the silencing of repeats to avoid transcriptional interference.</p>
<p>      Cancer hypomethylates intergenic regions and repetitive elements which then promotes genomic instability by illegitimate deletions, insertions, reciprocal translocations, loss or duplications of chromosomes. This in turn gradually causes hypomethylation, chromosomal instability and aberrations in the general tissue affected and surrounding genes (e.g. via illegitimate recombination, transcription interference or dmnt1 deletion) and also the spread of potential further cancerous damage (e.g. via transposition of affected genes from hypomethylated cryptic promoters activated).  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span></span><p>Imprinting genes are involved in growth promotion or suppression. Therefore, cancer cells display a loss of imprinting and associated cell control. Cancer makes imprinting expressed from either both parental alleles or silenced from them, where the usual is mono-allelic parent of origin expression which shows they’re imprinted.</p>
<p>Imprint Control Regions (ICR) for a gene can be either hypermythlated or hypomethylated dependent on gene function. For the H19/Igf2 cluster and a normal cell the Igf2 on the paternal allele is expressed as the ICR there is methylated. On the maternal allele Igf2 is silenced, ICR is unmethylated and CTF binds there so enhancers act on H19 downstream. This is 'imprint control by enhancer blocking'. Failure causes Beckwith Widemann Syndrome along with uniparental disomy and a predisposition to embryonic and childhood tumours, including Wilms tumor, which affects kidneys.</p>
<p>In Wilms, cancer causes Igf2 to be expressed on the maternal allele along with the paternal allele as it causes hypermethylation on the maternal ICR, creating a double dose of Igf2. A loss of imprinting causes an over expression of growth promoting genes or loss of tumour suppression genes which helps contribute to cancer again. This process often occurs early in overall cancer development.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span></span><p>  Decitbine is classified as a DNA-demthylating agent. It inhibits DNA methyltransferase, producing an hypomethylated state. Decitabine is activated via phosphorylation and when the nucleotide analog is incorporated into DNA.</p>
<p>  A normal cell typically has unmethalyted CpG islands with intergenic regions, repetitive elements and intrans areas of genes usually methalyted. Contrastingly, cancer cells have methylated CpG islands and additional areas hypomethylated. CpG islands are mostly at promoters of genes, particularly in tumour suppresor genes. Therefore, cancer cells methylate and thus silence the tumour suppressors, an epigenetic effect as opposed to a genetic mutation to inactivate tumour suppressors.</p>
<p>   Decitabine works epigenetically by demethylation or interfering with the methylation of DNA and CpG islands so normal function to the tumour suppressor genes is restored. Thereby restoring cell growth control. Additionally, it’s also an 'Antimetabolite' which can cause death to faster dividing cancer cells. Useful as DNA methylation is miotcally heritable and selected for. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span></span><p>DNA Methylation becomes a stable epigenetic mark, mitotically heritable, maintained by cell division through DNMT1 identifying a hemi-mthylated daughter strand. X inactivation is one process which allows an enduring effect on the epigenome throughout adulthood for females. Similarly, in mouse studies, folate acting as a methyal donor has been observed to shift an offspring's coat colour beyond usual genetic chance. It also increased methylation in the offspring, same to the increased particular maternal allele. This is epigentic inheritence via the gamates. It occurs during a sensitive period in the development of the offspring's epigenome. </p>
<p>A sensitive period is a period of clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks and it occurs in periods of pre-implantation and germ cell development. Sensitive periods occur in the womb and young. Thusly, it’s inadvisable to administer drugs which alter DNA methylation in the pregnant and very young. Though epigentic machinary is flexible, epigentic drugs can use this but then make futher epigentic changes irreversible. Drug interference could cause genomic instability on the developing individual, causing illness. </p>
<p>Also, the driving role of DNA methylation is context dependent. Biomarkers can reflect a particular stage and may require the patient waiting to avoid a particular drug for another.</p></div>
