    <div class="field-value"><p>Abnormal DNA methylation has been associated with cancer in two ways: hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes and hypomethylation of repeating element sequences (REs). DNA methylation in gene promoter regions normally suppresses gene expression, however, CpG islands, which are found in many gene promoters, are normally unmethylated and are therefore normally unsuppressed. However, in some cancers, CpG islands can be abnormally hypermethylated, which may result in transcriptional silencing of an associated tumor suppression gene, which can result in some cancers.</p><p>DNA methylation on repetitive element sequences (REs) are thought to regulate gene transcription for embryonic development, tissue differentiation, as well as in cancer development. Long-range silencing of REs can effect transcription in ways that are dependent on genetic and epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA hypomethylation. These mechanisms are complex, intertwined, and stage dependent, and need to be carefully controlled in two very different scenarios: in proper cell division to maintain cellular identity via correct mitotically inherited gene expression, and in the other case where pluripotency and differentiation is needed and epigenetic marks must be cleared and reestablished. Cancer can result from chromosomal instability due to gene silencing that may result in transcriptional noise caused by enabling incorrect start sites for transcription and undesirable recombination events. These complex mechanisms can also interact in many ways with other genes as well as environmental biochemical signals in ways that can lead to cancer development.</p><p></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Igf2 (insulin growth factor 2 gene) is normally only expressed by the allele inherited from the father, which is something known as "maternal imprinting". If Igf2 imprinting is missing, that results in methylation of the H19 promoter gene, which causes Wilms' tumor. Normally, the paternal IGF2 and maternal H19 genes are both expressed. But if upstream sites of H19 are methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele, then Wilms' tumor can develop. This is due to the resulting methylation of the H19 promoter on both paternal and maternal alleles, with both IGF2 turned on and both H19 turned off, causing improper control over cell growth.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, which can lead to ML (myelogenous leukaemia) and AML (acute myeloid leukemia). These leukaemias are the result of silencing tumor suppressor genes due to abnormal DNA over methylation. Decitabine acts as a DNA methylation inhibitor. These epigenetic problems can be partially and/or temporarily corrected with Decitabine (5-aza-2’-deoxcytidine). Decitabine works by targeting the DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) class of epigenetic inhibitors. In in AML , the main target is the histone methyltransferase EZH2. Unsilencing these tumor suppressor genes results in the desired anti-cancer therapeutic effect.</p><p><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes in methylation can be mitotically inherited during cell division to progeny cells for the life of the individual. These epigenetic changes are cleared during two early stages in producing new offspring. It is possible that epigenetic therapies can be found that stop cancer growth by epigenetically correcting them rather than trying to selectively destroy them. However, the effect of modifying DNA methylation can be developmental stage specific and therefore can produce different results during different stages of tumor genesis and during different stages of organ/organism development. Also, modifying DNA methylation at a global level can increase some aspects and decrease other aspects of various types of cancer development and different tissues may experience beneficial or detrimental effects of global changes in methylation at different times. Since it is complex and stage dependent, any attempt to treat cancer epigenetically with drugs that globally affect methylation must be careful regarding "sensitive periods" of development. In particular, early life is a period during which there is increased risk and sensitivity to methylation drug treatment. Epigenetic drugs should be avoided during these sensitive periods of early organ development. The most extremely sensitive periods are during blastocyst preimplantation and early germ line differentiation.<br /></p></div>
