    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:

    <div class="field-value"><p><b>CpG</b> <b>islands</b><span> <span>are regions in
DNA that contain a high frequency of </span><b>CpG</b> dinucleotides. In a healthy organism
these regions are related to promoters (found in about 60% of promoters) of
genes and tend to be protected from methylation. DNA methylation at CpG islands
prohibits transcription factor binding to promoters and thus means silencing of
gene expression.</span></p>

<p>In
cancer cells CpG islands often become hypermethylated thus preventing the underlying
genes from expression. Many genes important for maintaining healthy state
become silenced. In cancer locus specific DNA hypermethylation is observed, specifically,
CpG islands and CpG island shores of tumour suppressor genes, these genes stop
expressing and won’t control growth of tumours any more. </p>

<p><span>The
normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive
elements is maintaining genomic integrity and stability. Cells need to maintain
the karyotype (number and length of chromosomes, number and order of genes,
etc.). DNA methylation and consequently silencing of repeats helps to prevent
transposition in DNA, illegitimate recombination and transcriptional
interference from strong promoters.  </span></p>

<p><span>In
cancer, there is genome-wide DNA hypomethylation including repetitive regions. This
can cause abnormal karyotype with deletions, translocations, insertions.
Genome-wide DNA hypomethylation occurs in all tumour types (different degrees).
Consequence of this hypomethylation depends on location in the genome: in CpG
poor promoters it causes oncogene activation; in repeats and intergenic regions
= genomic instability. Hypomethylated CpG poor promoters can activate some
"bad" genes, for example miR21 is activated in glioma and it targets
tumour supressor PTEN.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alterations
in DNA methylation can affect imprinting in genome, i.e. allele specific
expression of genes, based on parent-of-origin of the allele. In normal cells
some genes exhibit monoallelic expression.</p>

<p>Hypermethylation
of imprinted control regions (ICRs) can cause loss of imprinting and
overexpression of some genes.</p>

<p><span>For
example, normal cells have imprinting in the paternal allele of the H19/Igf2
cluster and that causes the maternal expression of H19 and paternal expression
of Igf2. In Wilm’s tumour, a cancer of the kidneys that occurs in children,
affected cells have hypermethylation in this cluster and exhibit overexpression
of Igf2 (from both maternal and paternal alleles) and no expression of H19.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. This epigenetic drug is used to treat myelodysplatic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. Many types of cancer are marked with DNA hypermethylation and consequent
silencing of some genes (e.g. growth restricting genes, tumour suppressors). Decitabine
inhibits DNA methyltransferase – enzyme that establishes methylayion marks –
and thus promotes DNA hypomethylation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically
heritable, i.e. it is maintained through cell divisions. Daughter cells get the
same epigenetic marks as the mother cells had. From the other hand, these marks
won’t return after erasing – all daughter cells in this case will be free from
epigenetic marks if the mother cells were altered. These peculiarities of DNA
methylation heritability can help to develop efficient epigenetic therapies:
epigenetic drugs can stop a cancer growing by altering DNA methylation, and all
daughter cells will inherit the altered methyation pattern (newly established
epigenetic marks or no marks/ hyper- or hypomethylation).</p>

<p><span>Sensitive periods are periods of
epigenetic reprogramming, i.e. epigenetic marks are erased and then established
again. The sensitive periods of development are embryogenesis and
gametogenesis. During these periods epigenetic marks are more likely to be
established rather than maintained. Cells are sensitive to different
environmental influences in these periods; treating patients during sensitive
periods would be inadvisable because of possible mistakes in establishing
epigenetic marks. Cancer can come from a single cell with an uncorrected error.</span></p></div>
