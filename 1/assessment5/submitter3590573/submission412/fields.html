    <h1>Submission 412 from Anon (session_user_id: 693ccff4757272decd8abffc9e117ce7ba72e8d5)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to a class of DNA-demethylating agents of epigenetic drugs for cancer treatment. It's removing methyl residues from the DNA. It is probably most efficient for the hypermethilation driven tumors, where the main cause is the hypermethilation of CpG islands. As the hypermethilation of the CpG islands is often in the promotor regions of the tumor suppressor genes, removing the methyl residues would cause the activation of transcription of tumor suppressor genes, which could have an anti-tumor effect. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the normal DNA the CpG islands are not methylated. In cancer, the CpG islands are more likely to be methylated, and the methylation increases with the progression of tumor. It is usually find in the promotors of tumor suppressor genes. As it is mitoticaly heritable, methylation is a very effective way of silencing a tumor suppressor genes which leads to rapid multiplication of tumor cells and progression of tumor. Methylation of CpG islands varies by tumor types and it also leads to the hypermethylation of surrounding regions, called CpG shores. <br />Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually highly methylated. In tumor, it is found the at they are hypomethylated and methylation decreases with time. Hypomethylation is found genome wide,mostly in the repeats, but also in the CpG poor promotors,which leads to the activation of genes. Repetitive elements are normally heavily methylated and packed in heterochromatin. Loss of methylation leads to the repeats being in euchromatine, which allows the illegitimate recombination of repeats and genomic instability. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Loss of imprinting in cancer can be due to the hyper or hypo methylation, depends on the tumor, but in each case there are two copies of either maternal or paternal allele. Paternal allele is the example of  H19/Igf2 cluster methylated in the promotor region, which leads that enhancers act on the Igf2,  promoting its expression. Promotor on the maternal allele is not methylated, which leads to the biding of insulator protein CTCF to the promotor and H19 is expressed insted. IGF2 is in this case not expressed, as the enhancers act on H19 expression. In Wilm's tumor, there are two paternal like alleles, so on the both alleles the promotors are methylated and IGF2 expressed. We have double dose of IGF2 compared to the normal cells. As IGF2 is a growth promoting gene, this leads to the uncontrolled growth of the tumor cells. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">As the methylation is mitoticaly heritable, the drugs that alter the DNA methylation in one cell are causing all the future cells that arise from that one to have the same altered epigenetic methylation mark even if the drug is not used anymore,thus suppressing the tumor growth. <br />Sensitive periods are the periods in development in which the epigenetic marks are laid down. These periods are early embryonic development and development of the gametes, where the epigenetic marks are cleared and laid down again. The use of demethylating agents would be inadvisable as it might disrupt the formation of the epigenetic marks and therefore might cause some diseases in the offspring as the result of the abnormal epigenetics.<b></b></div>
