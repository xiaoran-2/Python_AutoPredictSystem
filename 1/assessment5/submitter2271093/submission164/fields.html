    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation in cancer could active or inactive the expression of a gene via hypermethylation of regions that normally were nonmethylated inactivated genes of growth control or by a hypomethylation of regions that were methylated for example methylation at CpG islands in normal cells resulted in the silencing of the gene. DNA methylation in CpG islands within the promoter resulted in the silencing of the gene in cancer cells (silencing of tumor suppressor genes) in contrast hypomethylation are related to the over-expression of oncogenes. At intergenic regions and repetitive elements DNA methylation is associated with an active gene so the hypomethylation at normally heavily methylated regions cause a genomic inestability and oncogene activation leading to a inactivation of the gene that control, for example, the reproduction of a cell a over cellular growth</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The H19 gene is exclusively expressed on one parental allele, is transcribed matternaly inherited because is normally hypomethylated or unmethylated while paternal allele is not expressed because is hypermethylated. In other way the parternal Igf2 is expressed and the matternal is not expression because is hypermethylated. Since this two genes are related to control cell growth as bigger the methylation of the promoter the expression of H19 will be less by consequense the expression of Igf2 will increase and a increase of Igf2 is related to a faster growth of cell, like in Wilm´s tumour. Any disruption of imprinting of this cluster will produce a over expression of the H19 causing may types of tumour.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, and it is use to treat cancer by demethylating groups in histone proteins preventing the silencing of tumour supressor genes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the trial that they made they use a histone deacetylase inhibitors and a DNA demethylated agents and maybe this made inactive genes that were affected by a anormally hypermethylation using the azacitidine and in the same way inactivating the overexprssion of the genes by deacethylating the histones. Knowing that epigenetic changes are passed during cell division once this epigenetic change is erased it would not return by the other way once is "created" this epigenetic change will be pass from generation to generation. And it is reasonable that if this epigenomic therapies creates changes in the the epigenomic state in the growing of a cancer, in some time the no-discrimination of normal cells and tumour cells in chemotherpies will be erased.<br /></div>
