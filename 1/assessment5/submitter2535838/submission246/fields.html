    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cells CpG Islands are generaly not methylated and tumour suppressor genes are expressed. In cancer cells CpG Island are hypermethilated, that means they have more CpG Island than normal. Hence, promoters of tumour suppressors of hypermethilated genes are not expressed and the cancer cell multiplies indefinitely. <br /><br />Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated, to prevent mutations by insertions or crossover. In contrast, in cancer cells these regions are hypomethilated, that means there are less methylated than they should, allowing these genes to be expressed leading to mutations and tumourgenesis.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>One can find hypermethylation or hypomethylation in imprinted genes, meaning that a gene that would normally be expressed once is eigher silent (hypermethilated) or expressed twice (hypomethilated). The consequence is that cell can stop growing (silent) or grow uncontrollably. Both cases suggests the early events of tumourgenesis. <br /></p><p>Considering the example of H19/Igf2, in a normal cell the paternal allele is methylated and the maternal allele is not methylated. In the paternal allele, the enhancer will act on the Igf2 and it will be expressed. In the maternal allele, the enhancer binds to the CTCF, which will act on H19 and hence the Igf2 will be silent. </p><p>When we have a loss of the imprinting, for instance the maternal allele will be hypermethylated and its Igf2 will be also expressed and hence, we have twice more genes expressed than in a normal cell, promoting grow, which is associated with tumour in childhood kidney.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a  class of epigenetic inhibitor that acts as a hypomethylation agent. It inhibits cell growth by i<span>nhibition of DNA methyltransferase, causing hypomethylation of DNA. Therefore decitabine helps the reactivation of the once hypermethylated promoters of tumour-supperssor genes, which by their turn prevent tumour.<br /><br /><br /></span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Effects on the epigenome are enduring because when altering DNA methylation, the altered cell will divide and, as epigenetics changes are mitotically iheritable, the daugher cells will carry the changes. </p><p>Sensitive periods are the moments in the live of mammals that epigenetics reprogramming occur, that means periods of gene demethylation. The two major sensitive period are germ cells development, early embryonic development. There also brief sensitive periods where tissue specific differentiation occur, mainly in childhood and adolescence. </p><p>In sensitive period it is inadvisable to treat patients with epigenetic drugs because a drug can be a very important insult that prevents the epigenetic machinery of functioning propperly, which can result in epigenetic errors leading to tumourgenesis. </p><p><br /></p></div>
