    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>Global level of methylation decreases as a
normal tissue progresses to a metastatic tissue, whereas methylation of CpG-island
becomes denser from normal to invasion tissues. In cancer cells, CpG island are likely to be
methylated than in a normal cells. And for the rest of the genome in
general, including repetitive elements in intergenic elements are
hypomethylated. And they have opposite states in normal cells. But the role of DNA methylation can differ with different types of tumour, and at the stage of tumours.</p><p>DNA methylation is an alternative to genetic mutation, to
silence the tumour suppressor in cancer. Recognised DNA methylation can be
one of the hits in kundson hypothesis, i.e., one of many factors that results
cancer.</p><p>Repetitive elements and intergenic regions increase the stability of the genome. Therefore, as a result of hypomethylation of repeat elements and intergenic regions this stability of genome decreases. For example illegitimate recombinations occurs, such as repicrocal translocations between two different chromosomes. In a normal cell, this won't happen because the repetitive elements are heavily methylated and heterchromatonized. But in cancer, we have hypomethylation of these repetitive elements and intergenic regions. They align, they misalign and an illegitimate recombination can occur, because they are not densely packaged down to heterchromatin. The hypomethylation can also result the activation of repeats and transposition, so that the repeats can make copies of themselves, and jump around the genome and transpose. This leads to different problematic problems depending on which part of the genome that they jump into. It can activate cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes, which leads to transcriptional aberration in the surrounding regions. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>One of the common
features in cancer cells is they display loss of imprinting, i.e., genes that
should display monoallelic parent-of-origin-specific expression no longer show
this imprinted expression but rather they become expressed from both parental alleles
or silence from both parental alleles.</p>

<p><span>In the case of the
H19/Igf2, it’s methylated on the paternal allele and unmethlyated on the maternal
allele. When it’s unmethylated CTCF will bind this insulator element which means that the enhancers will act on H19. But Igf2 will be silent for the
maternal allele. On the paternal allele, because it is methylated, the
enhancers can act of Igf2. Since CTCF 
is not binding to insulate this, Igf2 is expressed from the paternal
allele.</span></p>

<span>However, with the loss of imprinting,  hypermethylation of the imprinted control
region on the maternal allele as well, which results IGF2 being expressed on
the maternal allele too. With a double dose of Igf2 expression compared to normal
cells, cells overgrowth, as Igf2 is growth promoting. This particular overgrowth of cells is associated with  Wilms’ tumour. </span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent. It demethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. A lot of cancers of the immune system are caused by mutations that make an enzyme called EZH2 overactive. EZH2 enzyme attaches methyl groups to histone proteins, which are part of the chromosomal packaging. Such overactivity methylates histones more than they should be and thus silences their surrounding genes, including tumour-suppressor genes whose job is to stop the uncontrolled cell growth that causes cancer. Decitabine acts as an DNA-methylation inhibitor, and thus results the declination of histone methylation. Consequently, it activates surrounding tumour-suppressor genes, and the mechanism of controlling cell growth resumes to normal, thus to achieve its anti-tumour effect.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Unlike other forms of gene regulation, epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Therefore, epigenetic therapy, by altering DNA methylation, can effect changes which stop a cancer growing, and pass the same epigenetic information to their daughter cells, which also have anti-tumour markers.<br /><br />Sensitive period is when epigenetic marks are being established in the early development of an embryo, i.e., from oocyte to blastocyst, before forming placenta. Treating patients during sensitive periods, can pass incorrect information to its daughter cells, and thus results false epigenetic information for next generations. Secondly, to have a consequence for cancer, we only need one needs to be affected, while most of the cells remain their correct epigenetic states. The effected cell can then have downstream consequences and additional hits like the Knudsen hypothesis. So, one doesn't need to be in a sensitive period for one cell to react. Lastly, roles of DNA methylation are context dependent, different tumours have different dependencies on epigenetic markers, and can also be stage-specific. Thus, cancer treatments in non-sensitive period are more context-oriented and cell-specific, and therefore more effective.<br /><br /><br /></div>
