    <div class="field-value">Cancer is fundamentally a disease of the genome.  The naive view, which is what science gave us up until around 30 years ago, was that a mutation in the DNA code (think replacing an A with a C, for example) changes the coded amino acid, which leads to a bad protein and then cancer.  And while this view has an element of truth, the discovery of epigenetics has vastly increased our understanding of the many other ways cancer cells differ from normal cells.  We know the DNA of cancer cells tends to have methylated cytosine bases where normal cell DNA does not, and to have unmethylated cytosine where normal DNA has methylcytosine. In normal cells, methlyated CpG islands are not tremendously common: they are found mostly in imprinted genes, where they block expression of a parental gene copy, ensuring that the other parental gene copy is the only one normally expressed. Elsewhere in the normal genome, CpG islands tend to be unmethylated, and occur upstream of expressed genes. However, these same normal DNA strands <strong>will</strong> have methylcytosine in CpG pairs in intergenic regions and in non-protein-coding repetitive elements: in these regions methylcytosine contributes to genomic stability.  Cancer turns both of these normal epigenetic marks on their head: on the one hand, CpG islands upstream of genes coding for tumor suppressing proteins tend to be hypermethylated, therefore blocking expression of proteins that normally keep cancer in check, while on the other hand intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated in cancer cells, meaning the less stable genome that results is much more subject to further damage, that in turn leads to cancerous cell growth.  Both of these ways cancer disrupts DNA methylation can combine with other epigenetic changes and with base pair mutation to constitute Knudson's "multiple hits to the genome."<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The drug decitabine (trade name Dacogen) is an effective pharmacologic in the treatment of early AML.  Part of the class of epigenetic drugs known as DNA-demethylating agents, decitabine targets the hypermethylated DNA of cancer cells, and acts to remove methylation from methylcytosine bases found within the DNA strand.  Methylation of cytosine is an epigenetic mark normally (though not exclusively) associated with gene suppression, and at hypermethylated loci, the DNA in the genome of cancer cells tends to under-express tumor-suppression proteins and, more broadly, normal growth inhibition and cell death proteins.  As a result removing methyl groups from methylcytosine at those loci can restore expression of these normal proteins and slow runaway cell growth (although it can be misleading to describe decitabine's therapeutic effect in early AML as "anti-tumor," since there is not a tumor mass in leukemia or other cancers of the blood).<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The H19/Igf2 cluster is an imprinted locus found normally found, in humans, on Chromosome 11. Under normal human imprinting, the paternal copy of Chromosome 11 contains a hypermethylated, and therefore silenced, version of the H19 gene, while on the maternal chromosome H19 is hypomethylated and therefore expressed.  Maternal expression of H19 leads to upstream expression of enhancers that in turn silence the Igf2 gene (which is downstream of H19), while paternal silencing of H19 silences the upstream enhancers leading in turn to expression of Igf2: thus with normal imprinting the cell gets a single "dose" of the Igf2 protein, coded by the paternal chromosome.  One way imprinting can be disrupted is if the maternal H19 is also hypermethylated: it will then behave like the normal paternal copy, and the cell will get a <strong>double</strong> dose of the Igf2 protein.  Since the "gf" in Igf2 stands for "growth factor," abnormally high cell growth is the result of this double dose.  By this point, when you read "high cell growth," you should think cancer, and in fact misimprinting of this cluster is correlated with a childhood kidney cancer called Wilms' tumor.  (Sources consulted: English Wikipedia Articles "Insulin-like growth factor 2," "Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome")<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Treatment by modern classes of cancer pharmacologics that target the epigenome often correlates with better-than-average outcomes in follow-on treatment with routine chemotherapeutics.  While a definitive scientific explanation of this correlation is still developing, it is easy to hypothesize why this would be the case.  One of several ways DNA demethylating agents, through their conversion of methylcytosine bases to cytosine bases, can increase gene expression is by causing structural changes that "open" the DNA-histone complex known as chromatin and give RNA polymerase physical access to the promoter regions on the DNA stand.  Serendipitously, such open chromatin is also more accessible to cancer drugs, an explanation of the observed correlation.  However, care must be taken because these changes can be self-reinforcing: imagine that the genes "turned on" by the demethylating agents code for demethylating proteins or other proteins that modify the epigenome. This could interfere with normal epigenetic modification mechanisms, with heritable results unfavorable to offspring.  Such normal epigenetic modification is at higher activity levels during embyogenesis and germ cell development: the so-called epigentically sensitive periods.  It is therefore advisable to avoid epigenetic treatment of either partner if conception is possible, as well as treatment of children who have still-developing germ cells.<br /></div>
