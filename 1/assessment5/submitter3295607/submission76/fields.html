    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Where normal cells show parent of origin specific expression, so that one allele is active while the other is silent, cancer cells display loss of imprinting so that both alleles are either active or silenced. Many imprinted genes are involved in promoting or suppressing growth, so this disruption can cause overgrowth and cancer. In a normal cell the imprint control region between the H19 and Igf2 genes on the paternal allele is methylated and consequently the enhancers act on the Igf2 gene, which is expressed. However on the maternal allele the imprint control region is unmethylated. This allows the enhancers to act on the H19 gene, but Igf2 is silent. In Wilms' tumour, the imprint control regions are hypermethylated on both maternal and paternal alleles. This disruption of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer because both alleles express Igf2, producing a double dose. Since Igf2 is a growth promoting gene, its overexpression causes uncontrolled growth and a tumour can occur.</div>

    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are clusters of dinucleotides often found at promoters of genes. As a rule these regions are protected from methylation, but when they are methylated the gene corresponding to the promoter is silenced and inactivated. In cancer, although the level of methylation decreases globally throughout the genome, at some CpG islands it increases. The promoter may correspond  to a tumour suppressor gene, which controls the cell cycle including cell death and DNA repair. If the CpG island here becomes hypermethylated, the gene is silenced resulting in deactivation of the tumour suppressor gene and loss  of control over the cell which can then become cancerous. This is one contributing factor, as other 'hits' must also happen - for example an oncogene must also be activated for cancer to occur.<br />Intergenic regions and repetitive elements form most of the genome and are mostly heavily methylated. This methylation maintains genomic stability and prevents the loss or gain of chromosomes, as well as preventing illegitimate recombinations. In cancer these regions become less methylated and the DNA becomes unstable, and also less densely packaged. This causes illegitimate recombinations, resulting in  reciprocal translocations, deletions and insertions. The hypomethylation can activate repeat sequences, which can then make copies of themselves and transpose, jumping around the genome. This can disrupt a gene, or activate a promoter which thus activates a neighbouring gene. This hypomethylation, causing genomic instability and transcriptional aberrations, is a hallmark of many kinds of tumours.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi), used in the treatment of blood malignancies. DNA methyltransferases are enzymes which bind methyl groups to parts of the DNA. The drug Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue, so it is incorporated into the DNA. When cell replication occurs, the drug, now forming part of the patient's DNA, binds the methyl transferase irreversibly. The methyl transferase is now no longer available to methylate the DNA and methylation decreases. The drug is replication dependent, and since cancer cells divide rapidly, they are more affected than other cells. Decitabine therefore causes DNA demethylation and kills tumour cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Alteration of DNA methylation changes the expression of genes throughout the entire organism, because DNA methylation determines which genes are silenced and which are active. Sensitive periods are the times when epigenetic marks are cleared, and then laid down afresh; this is epigenetic reprogramming. This occurs between generations, to restore totipotency to the cells of a new embryo so that cells can differentiate to form a new organism. Sensitive periods are when germ cells are developing, and in the early stages of embryonic development. Treating someone with epigenetic drugs during sensitive periods would affect not only the somatic cells of that person, but also the germ cells. Consequently the epigenetic state of the next generation would be disrupted.</div>
