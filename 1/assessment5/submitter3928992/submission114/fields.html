    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, the hypomethylated CPG
island (Unmethylation in general at CPG islands). But the genome in general is methylated in their repetitive
elements through the intergenic regions and indeed even in the introns of genes. hypomethylated
CPG island in the normal's cells caused the activation of the most tumor suppressor
genes. As you know, the CpG islands more located in the promoters reigns of the
most tumor suppressor genes that best point for gene expression controlling. DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in
cancer by the inactivation of the oncogene or the genes that involved in the tumorigenesis.</p><p>In contrast, at a cancer cell, the CpG
islands are more likely to be methylated (They're not all methylated, but
they're more likely to be methylated than in a normal cell). And the rest of the genome, including the repetitive elements in these
intergenic elements, and indeed, the introns, are hypomethylated.</p><p>



</p><p>In the cancer cells, more of the CpG Island
in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes is hypermethylation and is inactivate,
because the CpG island hypermethylation, or CGI hypermethylation, in cancer cells. Generally, the cancer
cell is able to inactivate tumor suppressor genes, it could do so genetically,
or it could happen epigenetically by silencing the tumor suppressor gene by
locking in a silent inactive state. indeed, the repetitive elements in these
intergenic elements, and indeed, the introns, are hypomethylated that leads the activated the another hits
in cancer cells like the oncogene
or the genes that involved in the tumorigenesis (besed on <i>Knudson</i>
hypothesis).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alterations in DNA methylation at ICRs (hypo or hypermethylation), can
result in loss of expression of growth, restricting genes, and overexpression
of growth promoting genes restricting genes. For example in the Igf2H19 cluster:
Hypermethylationof ICR and Igf2 overexpression in Wilm’s tumour. Normally, in
the Igf2H19 cluster it's
methylated on the paternal
allele, and it's unmethylated on the maternal allele. When it's
unmethylated CTCF will binds this insulator element, and it means that
the enhancers
in this case will act on H19.  But Igf2 will be
silent for the maternal
allele, so we don't see expression. In paternal allele, because this is methylated, now the enhancers can act
on Igf2, because CTCF is not binding to inhibit this, and IGF2 is expressed
from the pattern allele.</p>

<p>However, with loss of imprinting and what happened is you have hypermethylation of the
imprint control region on the maternal allele as well, now, on the
maternal allele, you also
have expression of Igf2. So now you have a double dose of
Igf2 in comparison
to what you saw in a normal cell. And Igf2 is growth promoting, and this is associated
with Wilms’ tumour. This is this
particular childhood kidney
tumour that is observed.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine
is one of the DNA methyltransferase
inhibitors (DNMTi) drugs that approved
for AML or AML. The decitabine is similar to 5-Azacytidine and incorporated
into the DNA replication
process, when the DNMT comes along to bind it, the DNMT1 comes
along to bind that nucleotide
to then copy the methylation to the daughter strand, that DNMT is
bound irreversibly and it
can no longer be released. Since
the replication speed of cancer cells more than other cells, the decitabine will
be more affected
on the cancer cells. Decitabine
is not good at high dose. Because
you're not acting in the
range in which they cause
DNMT. Also, Decitabine been used at lower
doses, at these much lower
doses, far lower doses, you do have a very good anti-neoplastic effect, you
are killing the tumor
cells not another cells. Because seem to be causing DNA methylation, at least in
some cases.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Recombination not only needs
genetic identity
or genetic similarity, but
secondly needs open chromatin, euchromatin can occur. DNA methylation maintained genomic
stability, with prevent the recombination and opening the large areas of the genome.
In the normal cells, recombination wouldn't happen because the repeats
would be
heavily methylated and also they'd be heterchromatonized. In the normal cells the
intergenic intervals and repetitive regions hypomethleted, leaded the illegitimate recombination
between repeats. The DNA is densely packaged
for recombination to occur that DNA methylation is the main key for this densely packaging. By
definition, the sensitive period so
that one very large insult to the environment would be taking a drug that inhibits the epigenetic machinery. Treating patients during sensitive periods would be
inadvisable, because in this time, these sorts of things still need to
be considered, but it seems that the
future is bright for targeting the epigenetic machinery in cancer. That is quite
possible. Unlike other forms of gene regulation, epigenetic changes are passed
on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are
actively erased. It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect
changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.</p></div>
