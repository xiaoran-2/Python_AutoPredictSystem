    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value">In normals cells the CpG islands are hypomethylated and the rest of the genome is methylated while in case of cancer, the CpG islands are altered to being hypermethylated and the intergenic regions and repetitive elements loose methylation. Disruption of DNA methylation at the CpG island can lead to silencing of the tumor suppressor genes causing the lack of control on cell growth and hence lead to cancer. Cells that have this epigenetic alteration of methylation divide rapidly and cancer progresses. The intergenic regions and repetitive elements are generally hypermethylated which makes the gene densely packaged. In case of cancer, the repetitive elements and intergenic region lose the methylation and become hypomethylated, as a consequence the DNA becomes less compact and recombination can occur between two similar loci, causing chromosomal defects including deletion, insertion, translocation etc, all these changes are mutations and contribute to the progressing of cancer. Also, the hypomethylation and consequent activation of genes can include the expression of potent oncogenes, leading to tumor formation and uncontrolled growth i.e; Cancer. In all, in case of cancer, the CpG islands are hypermethylated and the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated. This is in contrast to what occurs in the normal cells. The swap of the methylation marks leads to structural and functional abnormalities among which cancer is a sure consequence. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprinting ensures that the offspring receives one copy of the gene from either of the parents as active while the other allele is selectively silenced (imprinted). If an offspring receives two copies of the same allele, this can lead to abnormalities.For example: Normally the ICR of H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated on the paternal allele, which leads to expression of Igf2. While in the maternal allele the ICR for H19/Igf2 cluster is hypomethylated, the enhancers cannot act upon the Igf2, they will instead act on H19 from this allele and Igf2 remains unexpressed. In Wilm's tumour, both, the paternal and maternal ICR become hypermethylated and Igf2 is expressed from both the alleles. Igf2 being a growth promoting gene, its expressions from both the alleles leads to uncontrolled growth and as a result tumour formation occurs. Disruption of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster as hypermethylation of the ICR can cause uncontrolled growth, contributing to cancer. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-Methyltranferase inhibitor used for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes. Decitabine can act upon the enzymes responsible for methylation of histones and cause demethylation in places where abnormal hypermethylation has occured. Abnormal hypermethylation leads to silencing of the tumor suppressor genes, causing the proliferation of tumors. Decitabine acts by decreasing the overmethylation, causing activation of tumor suppressor genes which in turn have an anti-tumor effect. The action of decitabine, being a DNMTi is division dependent, so it has a huge effect on cancer cells as they are replicating faster. By the action of Decitabine, the tumor suppressor genes become activated and regulate the growth of cells, keeping in check the case of uncontrolled growth and as a result Decitabine has an anti-tumour effect. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that alter the DNA methylation can have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment as DNA methylation marks are highly stable and are passed on to next generation unless actively removed. Since the DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, it has an enduring effect on the epigenome. A sensitive period is one where the epigenetic marks are being laid down, removed and reprogramming occurs, it includes the early developmental stages, the primordial germ cell development and early pre and post implantation period. In case of environmental influences pertaining to diet, the slow growth periods (age 9 to 12) where the development of gametocytes in still underway are also the sensitive periods. Treating patients during sensitive periods can hinder the epigenetic marks that are being laid down or removed and cause alterations to the normal processes of gene activation and silencing, leading to further abnormalities.  </div>
