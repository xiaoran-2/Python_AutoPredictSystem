    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are often promotors of genes, but when they are methylated, these promotor genes are silenced and therewith the genes they nornally would promote are not expressed.<br /><br />In the case of cancer the methylation CpG islands has been increased (hyper- methylation) This process progresses with time, so when people get older more CpG islands will be methylated..<br />When hyper methylation occurs, regions that are normally not methylated will be methylated. These CpG islands in normal cells promote the expression of tumor suppresion genes, so when they are silenced by methylation the normal tumor suppression in the cell is disrupted.<br />Additionally, the regions in the neighbourhood of CpG islands (the shores) will be hyper methylated as well again leading to silencing of these genes.<br />Since this methylation can be transmitted during mytose, this will be 
transmitted to daughtercells that will show similar non controlled 
growth<br /><br />Hypo methylation of the intergenetic regions and repetitive elements progresses with aging as well.<br />When hypo methylation occurs, regions that are normally methylated will lose their methylation. This happens in all types of cancer and is mainly found in repeats. When this happens the repeats are no longer silenced and this leads to genomic instability. This means that the repeats can be copied and these copies can insert in other DNA strains, or lead to crossover between genes during mytose and therewith a different geneexpression in the daughtercells.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the normal paternal allele, the imprinted controle region (ICR) for H19 is methylated as well as the promotor genes for H19. This means that that the upstream enhancers can not act on H19 but will act on the more downstream gene Igf2 which is a growthfactor.<br />In normal maternal cells, the ICR is not methylated nor is Hi9 itself. This means that the enhancers will act on H19 and therewith not act on Igf2. These genes from the maternal allele will not be expressed.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumour, both the maternal and paternal ICR is methylated, leading to an overexpression of Igf2 and therewith growth will be promoted more than in normal cells. Since this methylation can be transmitted during mytose, this will be transmitted to daughtercells that will show similar non controlled growth<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA demethylation agent. It acts on DNMT, and is a DNMT inhibitor. Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue. This means that it is incorporated into the DNA. It will irreversabily bind DNMT when it wants to methylate it, therewith reducing the amount of available DNMT in the cell.<br />This means that it will slowdown the methylation of CpG islands and therewith reduce the growth of a tumor. This is only effective during cell division but since cancer cells devide more rapidly than normal cells, the effect on these cells will be bigger than on normal cells.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is thansferred to daughter cells during the mytose. This means that once the methylation of a cell is altered all daughter cells will have the same epigenetic marks.<br />All cells divide, but epigenitic changes during the sensitive periods can have a long lasting effect and can even have an impact of offspring.<br />The senistive periods are those periods in life when the epigenic marks are being laid or removed so called epigenetic reprogramming. This happens in the very early embryotic stage and during the formation of gametes. During the formation of the gametes, the epigenetic marks which have either a paternal or maternal origin need to be reprogrammed depending on the gender of the parent. During the early embryotic stage, one of the X-chromosomes (in case there is more than 1 X-chromosone) needs to be silinced completely. Paternal and maternal dna needs to be epigeneticaly reprogrammed to become functional during the further development of the embryo.<br /></div>
