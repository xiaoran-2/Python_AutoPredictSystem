    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Alterations in DNA methylation at imprint control regions (ICRs) can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes, overexpression of growth promoting genes and cancer. One such examples is the hypermethylation of the H19/Igf2 cluster.  In normal cells, the paternal allele shows hypermethylation of the ICR, which does not allow CTCF binding and therefore downstream enhancers can reach Igf2 to promote its expression. In the maternal allele, on the contrary, the ICR is not methylated; this allows CTCF to bind the ICR, thus insulating downstream enhancers from Igf2 and resulting in the expression of H19 but not Igf2. As a result, the imprinting in this region ensures that only one copy of Igf2 is expressed. In Wilm's tumour, both the paternal and the maternal ICRs are hypermethylated, there is no CTCF binding and enhancers activate the expression of Igf2 from both alleles. This overexpression of Igf2, which is a growth promoting gene, induce cell growth and cancer in child's kidney.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi). It is a nucleoside analog; it is incorporated into the DNA upon replication such that when DNMT1 binds it to copy the methylation pattern to the daughter strand, DNMT1 is bound irreversibly to the DNA and the methyl group cannot be incorporated. Therefore decitabine causes hypomethylation of the DNA, which activates inespecific gene expression, and is dependent on cell division. Because tumour cells divide more than normal cells, they are more affected by the drug and thus decitabine can be used to activate the expression of tumour-suppressor genes and avoid the proliferation of tumour cells. Decitabine is altready on the market to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic drugs that alter DNA methylation can have enduring effects because DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic mark that is transmitted mitotically during cell division and is thus maintained in time even beyond the period of drug treatment. However, these drugs should be taken with caution during sensitive periods, when the epigenetic marks are erased and re-established again (i.e. in the pre-implantation embryo and during gamete formation). Using epigenetic drugs in young patients, whose gametes are still being developed, might induce abnormal methylation patterns in their gametes and thus have undesirable consequences to their offspring.</div>

    <div class="field-value"><div>DNA methylation is the basis for different epigenetic phenomena including imprinting, X chromosome inactivation and the formation of heterochromatin. Generally, DNA methylation of promoter regions causes inactivation of gene expression. Some promoters contain a high CpG density (i.e. CpG islands) and are usually kept free of methylation independent of their activity state. However, in cancer cells, promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene. When hypermethylated CpG islands silence a tumour-suppressor gene, cells proliferate in excess to form a tumour.</div><div>DNA methylation also appear at other places of the genome such as intergenic regions and repetitive elements. In normal cells the DNA is methylated at these sites to maintain genomic stability (i.e. avoid illegitimate recombination between repeats, avoid activation of repeats and transposition, and avoid activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes). In cancer, the DNA is hypomethylated in intergenic regions and repetitive elements and this leads to genomic instability due to the DNA being open to processes such us illegitimate recombination and activation of repeats, which all produce abnormal karyotypes with different sorts of structural rearrangements (e.g. insertions, deletions and translocations). This genomic instability can alter the expression of oncogenes and tumour-suppressor genes, thus inducing cell growth and cancer.</div></div>
