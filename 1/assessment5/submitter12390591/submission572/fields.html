    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normally, methylation of CpG islands are associated with the formation of repressive chromatin structures, resulting in gene silencing. Under normal circumstances, CpG islands tend to be unmethylated. However, in tumours, these tend to be hypermethylated, potentially resulting in decreased expression of essential tumour suppressors.<br /><br />Methylation of intergenic regions normally maintain genomic stability and silence cryptic transcription start sites. Additionally, methylation of repetitive elements prevent illegitimate recombinations. Hypomethylation of these regions observed in tumors lead to increased genomic instability, causing transpositions, deletions, duplications and activation of cryptic promoters that potentially drive tumorigenicity.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">-On the paternal allele, the ICR upstream of the H19 gene is hypermethylated. As a result, the enhancer acts on Igf2 instead of H19, resulting in Igf2 expression.<br />-On the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated, allowing the enhancer to promote the expression of H19, instead of Igf2.<br />-In the case of Wilm's tumour, the ICR of the maternal allele is hypermethylated like the paternal allele. This leads to the expression of two times the normal dose of Igf2.<br />-The increased expression of insulin-growth factor 2 promotes the growth, survival and proliferation of the tumour cell.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">-Decitabine is a nucleoside analog that belongs to the class of DNA-demethylating agents. <br />-It reduces the amount of DNA methylation by inhibiting the function of DNMT1.<br />-This agent may reverse any hypermethylation of CpG islands that led to the silencing of tumour suppressor genes, and restore its expression.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">- Inhibiting DNA methylation in tumour cells will result in daughter cells that have altered methylation levels. As DNA methylation is heritable, this will have enduring effects on the epigenome, even after the drug treatment period.<br />-A sensitive period is a time in which the epigenetic makeup of a cell is more likely to be affected by environmental factors.<br />-Primordial germ cell development and the early implantation period of embryonic development are sensitive periods.<br />-Treating younger patients (where their developing germ cells may be affected) or pregnant females with epigenetic drugs may result in developmental abnormalities/fatalities in their offspring.</div>
