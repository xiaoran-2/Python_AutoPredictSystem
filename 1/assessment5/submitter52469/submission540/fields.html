    <h1>Submission 540 from Anon (session_user_id: 16b0dee9f87c82e3bbcfc060003921fb0200a2ba)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent (or in other words, hypomethylating agent). 
<br /> That means that Decitabine causes loss of epigenetic methylation marks from DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase enzymes. 
<br /> If DNA methyltransferase is inhibited, it cannot replicate methylation marks during cell division, which results in hypomethylation.
<p>
    Decitabine can have anti-tumour effect by removing hypermethylation from promoter CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes, thus allowing their expression. Tumour suppressor genes can reduce tumours, for example, by triggering apoptosis or DNA repair.

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">CpG islands, which are found in about 60% of promoters, have a high CpG density and are usually kept free of methylation independent of their activity state.
In cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene, which can be a tumour suppressor gene.
<p>
 DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements reduces their mobility and increases genetic stability, by suppressing their expression and silencing transcriptional noise from alternative start sites, inhibit antisense transcription or direct RNA splicing. 
<br />
Disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements can cause overexpression of oncogenes or, in case of transposons, increase their mobility. Transposons may insert themselves in some tumour suppressing gene and break it, thus causing cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Imprinted control region is unmethylated on the maternal allele, and methylated on the paternal allele, and </div><div>this means it's paternally imprinted.<br />Igf2 is normally expressed only from the paternal allele and not the maternal allele.<br /></div><div><br /><span>Loss of imprinting of the IGF2 gene is the most common genetic or epigenetic alteration in Wilms tumor, it involves aberrant activation of the normally repressed maternally inherited allele.<br /></span><br /></div><div>Igf2 promotes growth, it's overexpression because of disrupted imprinting <span>at the H19/Igf2 cluster</span> can cause cancer.</div><div><br /><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic mark, which is replicated during cell division cycle.
<br />That means that if DNA methylation pattern is changed, those changes will persist in future cell generations (given there's no interference in methylation process like inhibition of DNMTs).
<p>
    Such changes can occur naturally during so called "sensitive periods". Sensitive periods are periods of active remodelling of the epigenome, when the environment may be able to influence epigenetic makeup.
    <br /> The first sensitive period is the period of primordial germ cell development all the way through to the production of mature eggs and sperm. The second sensitive period is the pre-implantation period after fertilization and early post-implantation
    period.
    <br />Also when you go through tissue-specific differentiation of the organs, there are brief windows in time when particular organs will have a very sensitive period, because of how that particular organ develops.
</p>
<p>
Applying epigenetic drugs during sensitive periods is inadvisable, because they may interfere with natural epigenetic remodelling and have adverse effect on patient's children and grandchildren by, for example, disrupting maternal/paternal imprinting, removing methylation marks where they are required or methylating regions that shouldn't be methylated.</p></div>
