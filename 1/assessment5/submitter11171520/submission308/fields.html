    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation levels in specific genomic locations in cancer cells differs form those of normal cells. Hypermethylation and hypomethylation mainly affect CpG islands in promoters, intergenic regions and repetitive elements. Normally, promoter CpG islands are unmethylated though most other CpG sites are methylated.  But in cancer cells they become hypermethylated. Hypermethylation also occurs in short regions before and after CpG island (CpG island shores).  Gene with methylated promoter CpG island is silenced. If cancer suppressor genes are silenced, the cell can not be prevented from turning into cancer cell. Usually, such a silencing works in combination with others genetic or epigenetic factors while causing cancer. Contrary to the CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated in normal cells but get hypomethylated in cancer cells. Loss of methylation in repetitive elements can produce changes in karyotype (insertion, deletion or translocation of chromosome). Unmethylated intergenic regions may enhance genomic instability though specific functions of many of those regions is still unknown.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In cancer cells imprinting control regions (ICR) of imprinted genes tend to be hypermethylated or hypomethylated. Both of these states can lead into cancer because of disbalance between growth promoting and growth restriction. Normally, Igf2 gene is maternally imprinted. This means that only paternal allele is active. H19 in paternal allele is methylated which allows enhancers activate Igf2. In maternal allele H19 is active, so Igf2 can not be expressed. If imprinting is lost, both paternal and maternal alleles are active and Igf2 is overexpressed. In Wilm's tumour Igf2 in both alleles are active as a result of hypermethylation of ICR. This means that cell produces too much insulin-like growth factor 2 protein. Because this protein is associated with growth, its redundancy can help cancer cell to grow more rapidly and avoid normal cell death. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to DNMT inhibitors. It reduces level of DNA methylfransferase enzyme which is responsible for maintenance of DNA methylation and so reduces level of methylation. If cancer is caused by hypermathylation of cancer suppressor genes, using of Decitabine can switch these genes on. Because cancer cells usually divides more rapidly, the drug has more affect on cancer cells than on normal ones. Reducing of DNMT in time of cell division means that new cells will have lesser methylation level.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic marks are mitoticaly heritable. It means that they remain through somatic cell division, so altered DNA mehylation lasts more than one cell's life-time. Sensitive periods are times when epigenetic reprogramming is happening. This means early embryonic development and primordial germ cells formation. Because germ cells remain partially matured until puberty, childhood can also be considered as rather vulnerable period. Because epigenetic drugs are not very precise, they can affect epigenome of normal cells. Such interference in periods when epigenetic marks lose their stability may cause abnormalities in newly formed epigenome. For example, DNMT inhibitor can force incomplete resetting of epigenomic marks because of reduced levels of DNA methyltransferase,<br /> <br /></div>
