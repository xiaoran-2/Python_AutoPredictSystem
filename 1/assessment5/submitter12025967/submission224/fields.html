    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are usually found within the promoter regions of genes and are typically unmethylated in normal cells. DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification of CpG islands laid down by DNMT enzymes. The presence of methylation here (at promoter) is normally indicative of gene expression silencing because either it attracts binding proteins which cause closed/tightly packaged (and thus less transcribed/expressed) chromatin, or somewhat less often, the addition of methyl groups can block binding of transcription factors. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements conversely are typically methylated in normal cells which is thought to promote genome stability by silencing transcription/expression of sequence abnormalities (such as mutations, transposons, deletions, or insertions).<br /> In short, what is normally seen in the genome are unmethylated CpG islands in combination with methylated intergenic regions and repetitive elements. In cancer, the reverse is typically seen within the genome: methylated CpG islands in combination with unmethylated intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br />When this happens, CpG islands (now methylated) found in the promoter region of tumor suppression genes may now silence the gene, and silencing of tumor suppression genes is one major step in setting the stage for cancer. In addition, the lack of methylation now seen at the intergenic regions and repetitive elements decreases genome stability, rendering the genome prone to those sequence abnormalities listed above.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele,
the imprint control region (ICR) is methylated which means that the insulator
protein CTCF cannot bind and insulate; the methylation spreads downstream to
silence lncRNA H19, leaving Igf2 open to distal enhancer action and causing Igf2 to be
expressed.</p><p>In the maternal allele,
the ICR is unmethylated so CTCF can bind and insulate Igf2 from downstream
enhancers and causing Igf2 to be repressed; the enhancers instead act on lncRNA
H19 (which is also unmethylated).</p><p>



</p><p><span>Many imprinted genes are
involved in either promotion or suppression of growth and the aberrant methylation
seen at the ICR may be hyper- or hypo- depending on the type of imprinted gene.
Imprinted genes impacted by cancer no longer display normal monoallelic
parent-of-origin specific expression and instead may be expressed or silent on
both parental alleles. Specifically, Igf2 is a growth promoting gene and its
expression in both parental alleles is caused by abnormal hypermethylation of
the ICR (and just downstream) on the maternal allele; in short, the maternal
allele looks/functions like the paternal allele, yielding overexpression of
Igf2 and consequently Wilm’s tumor.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Since Decitabine belongs to the DNMT-inhibitor
class of epigenetic regulation targeting drugs and is incorporated into
replicating DNA, each subsequent replication cycle will reduce the number of methylated
DNA strands because DNMT1 can no longer lay down methylation for the daughter
strands, and DNMT3 cannot provide new methylation to the strands, as these
DNMTs are now bound to the inhibitor in a manner that is not reversible. Because
cancer involves rapidly dividing cells (compared to normal cells), this loss of
methylated strands during replication will affect these cancer cells first and
foremost. This return to mostly unmethylated DNA in these areas (CpG promoters
of tumor suppression genes) represents a return to a more normal cell state. In
summary, Decitabine can have an anti-tumor effect because DNA hypermethylation of
CpGI is commonly what causes silencing of tumor suppressing genes and because
this hypermethylation is reversible since DNA methylation is mitotically
heritable.</span><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The main reasons that DNA methylation and
DNA methylation-altering drugs can have enduring effects on the epigenome
including beyond treatment is due to (1)DNA methylation being mitotically
heritable, (2)the yet-to-be-fully-determined potential for transgenerational
epigenetic inheritance, and (3)the existence of sensitive periods of
development: those phases where epigenetic reprogramming (clearing and
resetting of epigenetic marks) is taking place and altered environments (like
drug treatment) would have the biggest effect (primordial germ cell development
through production of mature eggs/sperm, and pre-implantation through early
post-implantation in early embryonic development). </p>

<p><span>Because therapeutic drugs that target
epigenetic machinery are not usually selective for only unhealthy cells but
rather can potentially target all cells, treatment should be carefully
considered especially for younger patients for whom sensitive periods (germ
cell development) still exist. It would also be inadvisable to treat a pregnant
woman with these kinds of drugs or for a woman and/or man to attempt or succeed
at procreation during treatment of either person.</span></p></div>
