    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation is an
important epigenetic regulatory mechanism. Most of mammalian genes have a CpG
island present at their promoters, indeed up to 60%, the methylation state of
these CpG island can be considered a good indicator of gene expression state,
in which the methylated promoter correlated with gene silencing and the
un-methylated with gene expression.  Also the presence of hypermethylated
CpG islands within the repetitive element &amp; intergenic region confirm genomic
stability. The presence of DNA methylation at these site mean that they will be
present at heterochromatic region, there presence within the highly condensed chromatin
mean they will not be able to perform recombination event with other repetitive
element and hence increase genomic stability. These two important functions namely
the control of gene expression and the genomic stability implies that any
change in the cellular methylome will have a huge effect on the cells, and
indeed this turn out to be true. We know that in caner there is global change
in DNA methylation represented by:<br />
1- genome-wide hypo-methylation reflects the 
hypo- methylation state seen at the intergenic regions </span></p>

<p>2- hyper-methylation
of CpG island present at the gene promoters </p>

<p>These two events lead
to:</p>

<p><span>1-    </span><span>Increase genomic instability, in other words
increase translocation and genomic recombination events.  </span></p>

<p><span>2-    </span><span>Deregulation of tissue specific gene expression,
might explain the loss of differentiation seen in most, if not all, malignancies
  </span></p>

<p><span>3-    </span>Loss of genomic imprinting </p>

<p><span>4-    </span><span>Repression of tumor suppressor genes (TSG),
indicating that not only genetic mutation at TSG that make them inactive in
cancer, but also epigenetic mechanisms, as DNA methylation, are also involved.  </span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19\Igf2 cluster is located at 11q15.5 its architecture goes
as follow (enhancer-H19-ICR-igf2). ICR contain the CTCF binding site in case of
ICR is not-methylated CTCF binds and prevent the distal enhancer to activate
the expression of Igf2 hence limit the transcription to the H19, meanwhile if
the ICR is methylated CTCF will not bind to ICR and Igf2 will be expressed, but
the methylation at the ICR cause the methylation to H19 lead to its repression.
So if the ICR is un-methylated (maternal allele) only H19 will be expressed and
if ICR is methylated (paternal  allele)
only Igf2 will be expressed. Wilms tumors is Kidney tumor that is usually occur
in children , H19\Igf2 imprinting deregulation is commonly seen in wilms tumor.
The methylation at both the maternal &amp; parenteral ICR lead to
overexpression of Igf2, as it now expressed from both alleles, and no H19
expression as a result of maternal ICR methylation. Igf2 can be described as
oncogene that promote growth &amp; H19 as Tumor repressor gene  so if H19 is silenced &amp; igf2 level
increased the cell will be at higher risk to develop cancer. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>With better understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms and
its role in cancer pathology better and more potent anti-neoplastic drug are
being produced. Decitabine is DNA methyl transfrease inhibitor it bind irreversible
 &amp; inactive the DNA MTase
enzyme leading to a decrease in the DNA methylation, and hence it described as
DNA hypo-methylation agent. Decitabine need to be incorporated into the DNA
first before it  bind and inactive DNA
MTase and hence it acts on the mitotically active cells gave it some
selectivity on cancer cells. Knowing  that in cancer cells there is a global hypo
methylation make the use of Decitabine paradoxical but knowing that most gene promoters
are silenced with Hyper methylation including the TSGs  explain that by removing the methylation from
the TSG promoters one might be able to activate the TSG function again and
hence get more control on cancer cells </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a major regulator of the epigenome, for
example DNA methylation has been linked to the Histone de-acetylation &amp;
methylation, and also the presences of methylated DNA binding proteins as MECP2
that is responsible for higher order chromatin structures. We also know that deregulation
of DNA methylation is seen in cancer &amp; also in aging so all these evidence point
to the essential role of DNA methylation in controlling the epigenome. DNA
methylation pattern is mitotically inherited so in most somatic cell DNA
methylation is stable. The only time window where DNA methylation patterns is
being established, is during what is called the sensitive periods.  Two sensitive period can be described the
first is during the early days of development, where the paternal DNA
methylation is being actively erased &amp; maternal DNA methylation being passively
erased. The second sensitive period occur at the development of the primordial germ
cell (PGC).  Any interference with the
DNA methylation at sensitive period will have disastrous results not only on
the cell but also on the whole organism and may be on the subsequent generations
, as DNA methylation is mitotically inheritable any abnormality occur at sensitive
period will have lifetime effect </p></div>
