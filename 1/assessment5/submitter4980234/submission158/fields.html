    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation has a important function to maintain the genomic stability in the cells, but to occurs DNA methylation it need some particular factors, like the CpG islands, and the expression of enzimes that put the methyl group in a specific target, like the methyltransferase. <br />The CpG island its a target of the DNA methyltransferase, its means that de methylation will occur in the CpG island, and the CpG are located in the sequence genomic. In normal cells, its tend to occur methylation in CpG islands in areas which are located in regions with a high rate of repetitive elements, intrergenic regions and also in introns, silecing this elements. This means that sequences will be with low expression.<br />In normal cells, some genes important to prevent cancer are active, like genes named as tumors suppressor, and others tends to be inactive.<br />But in cancer, this mechanism is altered, and tends to occur the inverse, regions that tends to be silecing in a normal cell are active, and regions that are to be active are silence, i.e. repetitive elements, intergenic and introns are hypomethylated, promoting a high rate of expression, promoting genomic instability, and some genes important to prevents cancer tends to be silence. All this sequences are controlled by the CpG island, if the CpG island are disrupted, than we have a loss of control in this regions, promoting genomic instability, driving to cancer.<br />Intergenic regions are regions that are located in the middle of two genes. Repetitive elements are mobile elements that when actives can jump to a different locations at the genomes, promoving mutations in the genome sequence. Because of this functions its is crucial that theses elements tends to be silecing. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Disruption of imprinting can contribute for a series of problems, like cancer. In this case we have a particular gene that contribute to cancer and is associated to imprinting disruption.<br />In this cluster are presents in both maternal and paternal allele a gene called lgf2, a ICR (impriting control region), a long non-condig RNA called H19 and enhancers.<br />In the pattern of maternal allele the ICR are unmethylated, and because of it, a insulator protein called CTCF can bind to the ICR. This bind prevents the enhancers to act on lgf2, so the enhancers act on the expression of H19. In this case the gene lgf2 are off.<br />In the other hand, in the paternal allele, the lgf2 are on, and its because the ICR are methylated, and this methylation spread in the genome until the promoter of H19. With ICR methylated the CTCF can no longer bind there, allowing the enhancer act lgf2, turned on.<br />In imprinting disorder we can have two paternal allele, with a overexpression of lfg2. This is what happen with Wilm's tumour. lfg2 act on the cell growth. If we have a overexpressed of this gene, we consequently increase the growth rate, contributing to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a drug belongs to classe of DNMTi. This class of enzime has a function to methylated a CpG island, turning the gene or sequence inactive. Decitabine belong to this grup DNMTi because its function is inhibit this class of enzime (the letter "i" indicates inhibitor). Decitabine is a hypomethylated agents, its means that his functions is hypomethylated a region turning the region active, and besides, block the enzimes of DNMT to put a methyl group, inhibiting the function of this enzimes in the region that decitabine act. <br />Make use of this function, decitabine has a important function to prevent tumours. We know that there are some genes named as suppressor turmours, and this genes need to be active. Decitabine can operate on this genes, preventing that this genes turn silence by the enzimes DNMT. Due to this function, decitabine can have a anti-tumour effect.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Some of this altering DNA methylation can have a durable effects. This occurs because some effects can alter DNA methylation and block any other change that will occur in the region. We know that some marks are passed through generations, so the cell will carry this block to the daughter cell.<br />In the cicle of life, we actually have two sensitive period in the epigenetic. This sensitive periods are periods that we have a erase of all DNA methylation, that means that all the marks of epigenome are erased. This two sensitive periodo are well know by the science and the first occurs in the early development, when a egg is fecundate by a sperm until the blastocist. The second sensitive period occur during the formation of primordial germ cells, its when the body are generate the gametes.<br />The use of epigenetic drug in these two periodo need to be avoid, if a person are using some drug in these period this person are change the epigenetic marks when they are not active. This could drive to a huge problem when the epigenetic marks return. This alteration that may will occours can drive serious problems to the person.</div>
