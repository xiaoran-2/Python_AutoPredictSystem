    <h1>Submission 240 from Anon (session_user_id: 4b4415500e8d2a69fb028b430af67daf288073b2)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the DNA demethylating class of epigenetic ihibitors. In myelodysplastic syndroms, CpG islands are hypermethylated, which can lead to inhibition of tumor suppressor genes. Treatment with decitabine inhibits DNA methyltransferases, which alleviates this hypermethylation allowing for normal expression of the tumor suppressor genes.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is disrupted in two seemingly opposite ways in cancer: hypermethylation of CpG islands and hypomethylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements. In normal conditions, CpG islands are not methylated while intergenic regions and repetitive elements are. This allows for expression of genes located at the islands as well as silencing of sequences located in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. In cancer however, CpG islands become hypermethylated, which can lead to repression of genes in these regions, many of which are tumor suppressors. With the silencing of these tumor suppressing genes, cancerous growth can occur unchecked. Hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements leads to genome instability, which can also contribute to cancer downstream.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Since DNA methylation can be mitotically heritable, altering methylation with epigenetic drugs can have enduring effects; once the methylation status is altered, it will continue for the life of the individual. This can be dangerous during sensitive periods when the methylation status is endogenously reset, ie: during the two periods of epigenetic reprogramming--primordial germ cell development and early post-fertilization development. Since demethylation and methylation during these periods are needed to set up normal spermatogenesis and oogenesis as well as cell type differentiation in the developing zygote, treating patients during these times could lead to mutational side-effects.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">One example of how imprinting disruptions can lead to cancer is disruption of the H19/Igf2 cluster in WIlm's tumor. The H19 ICR is normally paternally imprinted, with DNA methylation on the paternal allele. When the ICR is methylated, CTCF acts as an insulator, preventing enhancer binding to H19, and instead promoting expression of Igf2. When the ICR is unmethylated, as on the maternal allele, enhancer binding to H19 occurs and H19 is expressed instead of Igf2. In Wilm's tumor, the ICR becomes methylated in the maternal allele as well, resulting in overexpression of Igf2, which is a growth factor, and no expression of H19, a lncRNA. This combination of upregulation of an oncogenic gene and downregulation of a tumor suppressor contributes to cancer.</div>
