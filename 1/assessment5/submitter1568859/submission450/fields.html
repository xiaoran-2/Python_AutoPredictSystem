    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is
altered in cancer when compared to normal cells. In mammalian systems, DNA
methylation occurs exclusively at CpG islands and is needed to maintain genomic
stability.This silencing of CpG islands prevents transposition and is the normal function of DNA methylation at repetitive
elements. However, in cancer the inappropriate methylation of CpG islands,
which are associated with the promoter regions of many genes including tumor
suppressor and oncogenes, is observed. Silencing of tumor suppressor genes and over-expression of oncogenes through hypermethylation and hypomethylation of promoter regions respectively are the two mechanisms by which cancer occurs. Tumour
suppressor genes normally function to suppress uncontrolled growth of cells and
oncogenes normally function in cell proliferation. When tumour suppressor genes
are silenced and oncogenes are over-expressed, there is no regulation of cell
cycle and cells keep growing abnormally which ultimately leads to cancer.<span><br /><br />Intergenic
regions and repetitive elements in normal cells are methylated in order to
maintain genomic integrity. In cancer, genome-wide hypomethylation in these
regions are seen. During the course of years of cancer research it has been concluded
that hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements is more
consistent than genetic mutations. DNA methylation of repetitive elements
prevents transposition from occurring. Transposition introduces mutations
within the genome and thus hypomethylation of repeats leads to cancer
development. Disruption of methylation in repetitive elements results in
transcriptional interference in the DNA of the cell and produces
tumourigenesis. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinted genes are
genes whose expression is determined by the contributing parents. Imprint
Control Regions (ICRs) are responsible for the expression of these imprinted
genes. In normal cells, the paternal allele of the ICR is methylated which
prevents CTCF binding and leads to expression of Igf2. Whereas the maternal
allele of the ICR is unmethylated and thus CTCF binds to it and silences Igf2
expression. Here, CTCF is an insulator protein which insulates Igf2 from
downstream enhancers. Silencing of the Igf2 causes the H19 gene to get
expressed by the enhancers through chromatin looping in the maternal allele. So
basically Igf2 is expressed on the paternal allele and H19 on the maternal
allele.</p>

<p>In cancer, particularly in case of Beckwith Wiedemann Syndrome the maternal allele of ICR starts behaving like the
paternal allele. This may be caused by a mutation or deletion within the Igf2/H19
cluster leading to loss of imprinting, unipaternal disomy or an epigenetic disruption
such as loss of DNA methylation imprint marks. Anyone of the previously stated
reasons causes upregulation of the Igf2/H19 cluster leading to excessive growth
promotion ultimately resulting in cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer, there is a
general dysregulation of the epigenetic mechanisms for the control of gene expression.
Oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes are the two main types of genes that are
often upregulated and down regulated respectively which ultimately tilts the
balance between cell proliferation and cell death. Thus drugs targeting the epigenetic
control enzymes that perform DNA methylation are well suited for cancer
therapy. </p>

<p>Decitabine is one such
drug that belongs to the DNA-demythlating class of drugs. Since Decitabine
functions as a DNA-demythlating agent it removes methyl groups from tumour suppressor
genes and thus there is suppression of uncontrolled cell proliferation. Since
Decitabine results in appropriate expression of tumour suppressor genes, it is
used as an anti-tumour drug.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an
epigenetic alteration that is mitotically heritable. This implies that if the
DNA methylation marks of a cell is changed, then when that cell divides the
daughter cells will retain the same methylation marks as those of the parent
cell. Since the epigenetic marks are conserved from one generation of cells to
another it has enduring effects on the epigenome. This is how drugs that alter
DNA methylation have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment.</p>

<p><span>Drugs that alter the DNA
methylation patterns must not be given to patients during certain periods of
development. A sensitive period is a period of time during which there is an
increased sensitivity of the epigenome to environmental changes. Sensitive
periods are during primordial germ cell development and early development.
During these periods treating patients with epigenetic machinery targeting
drugs must be avoided as they may alter the epigenome in undesirable ways. These
may cause inappropriate methylation of genes leading to non-functional protein
synthesis, altered signalling molecules and receptors.</span></p></div>
