    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>One mode of DNA
	methylation disruption in cancer is at CpG islands [CGI's], another is at
	intergenic regions and repeats.</p><ul><li>CpG
	islands seldom are methylated that is they are usually
	hypomethylated including  tumour suppressing genes while the
	remaining of the genome is hypermethylated/silenced. This maintains
	genomic stability.</li><li>
	<br /></li><li><p>Cancer
	tends to progressively hypomethylate/activate CpG island expression
	while silencing the remaining genome. This disruption of DNA
	methylation in cancer causes a switch silence to expression and
	expression to silence.   
	</p>
	</li><li>Disrupted
	DNA methylation at CpG islands increases global hypomethylation and
	silences suppressor activity.  DNA methylation mitotic heritability
	mechanism is high-jacked to maintain cancer's swap frequent in
	tumour cells where epimutations are rapidly selected although
	context [type of cancer/tumour] dependent.</li></ul><br /><br /><ul><li><p>The
	Normal function of DNA methylation is hypermethylation in intergenic
	regions and of repetitive elements, that is, silencing potential
	interference and activity.  It is thought that in both of these, DNA
	hypermethylation provides genomic integrity.  This methylation
	relates to heterochromatin density.</p>
	</li><li><p>Cancer
	requires open doors and disrupts DNA methylation by progressively
	hypomethylating the intergenic regions and repeats allowing
	deletions, insertions, duplications and translocation in intergenic
	regions and freeing repeats to willfully jump, copy or cut and paste
	causing illegitimate recombinations.</p>
	</li><li><p>This
	disruption of DNA hypermethylation in intergenic regions and of
	repeats gives cancer's a rapid takeover and a broad highway by
	destroying genome integrity.  It may also, allow cancer cells to
	mutate itself to enable jumps into other contexts, for example
	breast cancer cells [therapeutically] inhibited, brain cancer
	evidences.

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A disruption of
	imprinting can also contribute to cancer.</p><ul><li><p>In H19/Igf2,
	DNA methylation is imprinted on the paternal allele.  The enhancers
	are free to promote Igf2 on the paternal allele.</p>
	</li><li><p>The maternal
	allele is unmethylated.  Maternally, the Igf2 is insulated from
	downstream enhancer activity by the CTCG protein so the enhancers
	then loop over to act upon H19 – a lncRNA.    
	</p>
	</li><li><p>Wills tumour
	is an imprint disease caused by over-expression of Ifg2 growth.
	There is also a loss of a functioning of H19 / Cdn1c suppressor
	gene. 
	</p>
	</li><li><p>When CTCF
	cannot bind maternally in the Imprint
	Control Region,
	Igf2 is doubly 	promoted as if there are 2 paternal alleles.  Igf2
	is a growth promoter, an oncogene. The 	maternal inhibitor [tumour
	suppressor] Cdkn1 is no longer active resulting in H19/Igf2 cluster
	contributing to cancer through the inactivating suppressor genes and
	over-expressing oncogene.  The exact opposite of normal.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li><p><span>Decidable is a nucleoside analogue drug.  FDA approved [2006] for acute
	myeloid leukemia [AML].  A DNA de-methyltransferases
	inhibitor [DMNT1i] that targets this specific epigenetic regulating
	enzyme in low therapeutic dosages.</span></p>
	</li><li><p>It has

	replication.  
	</p>
	<p>Although

	replicates faster it will be bound more severely mitigating
	collateral damage. 
	</p>
	</li><li><p>Tumors seem
	to accumulate higher levels of DNA methylation during progression. 
	In contrast, it appears that using such drugs at low therapeutic

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li><p>DNA
	methylation is mitotically heritable and reversible. Cancer can
	change DNA methylation expression. Therapeutic binding of cancer's
	interference via epigenetic therapeutics is also a reversing
	activity but it is irreversible. Once bound stays bound.  This
	binding of cancer's oppositional effects are written in  at each
	cell replication yielding mitotic endurance.  This
	irreversible binding may allow improved overall results from
	chemotherapy as the targeted tissue cells would not be actively
	expressed.</p>
	</li><li><p>A sensitive
	period is when epigenetic environmental change has the greatest
	effect.</p>
	</li><li><p>Most
	pronounced are primordial germ cell and early embryonic development.
	                        Ages 9-12 for males and 8-10 for females
	plus their fetal/infant stages are transgenerational sensitive
	times. 
	</p>
</li></ul><ul><li><p><span>It is an inadvisable to treat patients
	during the two developmental periods because the risk of severe
	damage, even loss of viability, is extremely high as cells then are
	most vulnerable to interference.                                                                                                                                    During preteen years in both sexes
	and in female infancy the risk is transgenerational heritability to

	              The compounded female risk is in pregnancy – to

	                                                 Known toxins or
	disease aberrations create individual sensitivity that
	may exacerbate from therapeutic DNA modifications downstream hits
	[Knudson repetitives] potentially further decreasing global methylation expression. <br /></span><br /><br /></p>
