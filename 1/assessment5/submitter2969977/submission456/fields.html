    <div class="field-value">Majority of CpG islands are protected from methylation, but if some CpG island is methylated it is associated with silencing of gene expression. Methylation can inhibit the transcription of gene by physically obstructing the binding of transcriptional proteins to the gene or by recruiting methyl-CpG-binding domain proteins. In cancer abnormal hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes has been observed and because of mitotic heritability of DNA methylation this tumor suppressor genes will be silenced effectively. Cells possessing this type of epimutation generally have increased dividing rate and decreased rate of cell death, which gives them advantage over surrounding cells and ability to proliferate rapidly and widespread.<br />Intergenic regions and repetitive elements also play an important role in cancer. In normal cells, they are usually methylated, which enable to maintain genomic stability, however in cancer intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be unmethylated. This hypomethylation ca cause genomic instalibity like illegitimate deletions, insertions, reciprocal translocations, duplication of chromosomes, loss of chromosomes, activation of repeats and transposition or activation of cryptic promoters. All this events can affect the functioning of the cell, for instance activation of cryptic promoters, which are normally epigenetically silenced and inactive, may lead to the transcription and translation of aberrant peptides, transcription of antisense RNA and interfering RNAs, which also can have influence on cell functioning. Because of hypomethylation chromatin is not densely packed  down into heterochromatin and reciprocal translocations can occur. Activated repeats may translocate around the genome, which can cause disruption of coding region of the gene or activation of neighboring genes, which should not be active. That is why g<span>enomic instability is often associated with cancer and can be indicative of some types of cancer.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">H19 and Igf2 belong to the same cluster of imprinted genes and play a significant role in fetal/placental growth. They are expressed from different paternal alleles and their expression is regulated by imprinting control region ICR. H19/Igf2 is normally unmethylated on the maternal allele, that allows binding of CTCF protein, which is an insulator protein and blocks transcription of Igf2 and allows enhancers to activate H19 non-coding RNA. Conversely, on the paternal allele H19/Igf2 ICR is methylated, CTCF do not bind, which allows enhancers to activate Igf2 transcription. DNA methylation spreads to H19, which become silenced.<br />In general, H19 has a growth restraining effect and Igf2 has a growth promoting effect and their accurate methylation is important for normal growth. In Wilm's tumor ICR is hypermethylated, methylated on both paternal and maternal alleles. In this case Igf2 is not only expressed from the paternal but also from the maternal allele, which leads to Igf2 overexpression and also a loss of H19 gene activity. An increase in Igf2 gene activity, which promotes growth and proliferation of the cell and loss of H19 gene activity, which restrains growth, together can lead to cancer. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a drug that inhibits DNA methylation. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase - DNA methyltransferase inhibitor DNMTi. It is nucleoside analogue, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, chemical analogue of cytidine, used for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes. During replication Decitabine is incorporated into DNA and during transcription into RNA. The incorporation of Decitabine into DNA or RNA inhibits methylotransferase, which cause demethylation in the sequence. This results in hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis. Hypomethylation caused by Decitabine may restore normal function to genes that control cellular differentiation and proliferation. Demethylation of tumor suppressor genes, silenced by DNA methylation, may have influence on karyotype normalization. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is stable and heritable because of DNA methylotransferase DNMT enzyme which catalyze the transfer of a methyl group to DNA. Without the DNA methyltransferase the replication would not produce methylated daughter strands, which over time, would lead to passive demethylation. DNMT1, which is responsible for maintaining patterns of methylated cytosine residues in the mammalian cell, methylates, almost exclusively, hemimethylated CpG dinucleotides and by this allows to maintain specific pattern of methylation through cell division.<br />Sensitive period is period, during development, of extensive epigenetic reprogramming, which happens in early development (pre-implantation period) and during primordial germ cell development (mid-gestation embryo). Becuase of this sensitive periods, treatment with Decitabine is inadvisable to pregnant women or women planning to be pregnant (a few months before contraception). In pregnant women Decitabine may alter epigenetic reprogramming process and by that have negative impact on developing embryo. </div>
