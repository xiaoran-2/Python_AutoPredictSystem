    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at CpG islands blocks the transcription of that DNA.<br />In a normal cell, CpG islands are hypomethylated, and the genes associated with those CpG islands are expressed. In cancer cells, CpG islands are more likely to be methylated, especially in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes. This silences these tumor suppressor genes. As tumor suppressor genes protect the cell against the development of cancer, losing the expression of these genes is one of the factors that contribute to the development of cancer.<br /><br />In a normal cell, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated. This helps maintain genomic stability.<br />In cancer cells,  intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated. This allows illegitimate recombinations between repeats, activation of repeats, activation of cryptic promoters... This genomic instability disrupts other genes, leads to a high number of alterations in the genome, which is a major driving force in cancer development.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the H19/Igf2 cluster, the imprint control region is normally methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternel allele.<br />CTCF is a protein that, when it binds the ICR, insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers.<br />On the paternal allele, CTCF cannot bind the methylated ICR. The downstream enhancers can act to promote expression of Igf2. H19 is not expressed. <br />On the maternel allele, CTCF can bind the unmethylated ICR. This insulates Igf2 from the enhancers, the enhancers cannot act on Igf2 and Igf2 will be silent. The enhancers are then free to act on H19, promoting the expression of H19.<br />In Wilm's tumour, there is loss of imprinting, with hypermethylation of the ICR on both the paternal and the maternal allele. Igf2 is expressed from both alleles, so we have twice the amount of Igf2 being produced. Igf2 promotes growth, which can contribute to cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent that is use<span>d to treat myelodysplastic syndromes.<br />There is often an increase in DNA methylation in cancerous cells, that can result in the silencing of tumor suppressor genes.<br /></span>Decitabine helps demethylating the DNA and interferes with the methylation of DNA. The normal function of the tumor suppressor genes is restored and this helps control cancer growth.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. If a drug alters DNA methylation, those alterations will be transmitted to daughter cells.<br />A sensitive period is a period of development where epigenetic marks are being cleared and reset. This happens during pre-implantation and during germ cell development. Treating patients during these periods would be problematic, because the drug would interfere with the normal resetting of epigenetic marks, and this could lead to imprinting disorders.<br /></div>
