    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer is a group of illnesses that happen
when cells start to reproduce in a non-controlled way. Usually we relate cancer
with mutation in the genome provoked or not by environmental factors. But fails
in the epigenetic control can be related to cancer too; this way we could
silence tumour suppressor genes or activate oncogenes. We find a relationship
between cancer and the level of DNA methylation: hyper or hypomethylation.</p><p><span>One place where we find these fails is in
GpC islands. They are at the promoter of the genes and usually are
unmethylated, in fact they are protected against methylation because that mean
gene silencing, so this happens when a gene has to be silenced: in X chromosome
inactivation that happens randomly in one of the X chromosomes in females. This
produces a condensation in the chromatin so it can be transcribed.
Hypermethylation could  happen in CpG
islands silencing tumour suppressor genes. Since methylation is a mitotically hereditable
change this would happen in all the daughter cells, they will reproduce without
control causing a tumour. This hypermethylation will continue progressively in
time.</span></p><p><span>On the other hand intergenic regions a repetitive elements
are usually methylated in the normal cell. In the intergenic regions this
methylations exists in order to maintain gene integrity:  to avoid deletion, translocations between
chromosomes in the middle of the gene or insertions. In repetitive elements the
methylation also maintain genomic integrity and prevent transpositions and  illegitimate recombinations . Having these
repeats silenced avoids their translocation around the genome to a illegitimate
sites.</span></p><p>





</p><p><span>When this sites are hypomethylated  will lead to genome instability and all the
things mentioned before could happen. In fact this is a hallmark of cancer that
is more consistently than mutations.</span> We have good evidence (experiments
in mice) that having hypomethylation leads to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>According
to the article Decitabine is a DNA-demethylation agent, that means it removes
the methyl groups from DNA. Actually is being used to treat myelodysplastic
syndromes.  <span>Some cancer are provoked by
overmethylation of some genes that silence tumor-supresssor genes. So if the
drug take away the methyl groups, without affecting other functions, the genes
would be active again. This epigenetic effect would pass mitotically which
would have an antitumoral effect because it slow down the proliferation of
these cells.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alterations
on patterns of methylation in IRC (Imprint Control Regions) can contribute to
cancer. In imprinting we find that one of the progenitor 's gene is inactivated
by methylation. Inactivation depends on from which parent is inherited. If this
inactivation fails we get aberrant expression of some genes, very common in
cancer.</p><p>Imprinted
genes are usually in clusters, in the case of the H19/Igf2 is paternally imprinted:
that means that the IRC is active in the maternal and silenced in the paternal
allele. </p><p>In the
maternal allele the IRC is unmethylated which lets bind an insulator, CTCF;
This protein insulates the gene for Igf2 from the enhancers so it won't be
transcribed. The enhancers will go to H19 that will be transcribed.</p><p>In the
paternal allele the IRC is methylated so the insulator cannot bind and the
enhancers enhancers can access Igf2 that will be transcribed. The methylation
of the IRC can spread to H19 promoter, this way the chromatin in not accessible
and H19 will be silenced.</p><p><span><br />
In Wilm's tumour both IRC from both alleles are methylated which result in an
over expression of Igf2 which codes for growing factor, so it'll be too much
growing of the tissue.</span></p><p> </p><p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><br /></p><p>The
article talks about some drugs that are able to demethylate DNA and
modificate methylation in histones also. 
</p><p>
DNA
methylation is an epigenetic mark and we
have already learnt that hypermethylation is related to cancer, that
makes the gene silenced, so
tumour suppressors can not be working. This methylation is
mitotically heritable, is gonna be passed to the daughter cells.</p><p><br /></p><p>If
some drug is able to modify the methylation in the DNA that is gonna
last for the future generation of cells  affected by the drug. That
means even if the drug is not longer taken by the patient.</p><p>





</p><p>There
are some periods in the development when epigenetic marks are
established and can be  sensitive to other factors as
environmental ones.<span>The
epigenome in the individual is erased an established the novo when
forming gametes (although studies something is passed through
generations) and in the embryonic development too. There are also
some studies that shows that epigenome can be modified early in
development.<br />Since the epigeme is established and that is go</span>nna
be<span>
inherited mitotically is no advisable to  be treated with any
drug that can alter that because that changes are going to last in
that cells and its offspring.</span>
