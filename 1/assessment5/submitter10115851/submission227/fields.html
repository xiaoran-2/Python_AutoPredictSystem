    <h1>Submission 227 from Anon (session_user_id: b4f898fc731d4f647f9cb10ebab1989357c15885)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is an FDA approved DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. It causes DNA demethylation when the cell divides. Since cancer cells divide more rapidly than other cells, they will be more affected, which is how it has an <span>anti-tumour effect for patients with myelodysplastic syndrome in small doses. It could help with other malignancies as well, and is currently in clinal trials.</span><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">CpG islands and CpG island shores are generally unmethylated near the promoter of active genes. However, in cancer patients, CpG islands and CpG island shores near the promoter of a gene are much more likely to be methylated, which in this case is a silencing epigenetic mark and tends to prevent those genes from being expressed.<br />Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated to prevent aberrant transcription and expression. But they tend to be hypomethylated in cancer patients, leading to genomic instability, which contributes to the cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have lasting effects on the epigenome because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. A sensitive period is when a persons' epigenome is more sensitive to environmental insults, usually during epigenetic reprogramming. In younger cancer patients, a sensitive period for treatment with epigenetic drugs would be during germ cell development, since the drugs could then potentially affect the patients' children.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Igf2 is normally imprinted so it is methylated on the paternal allele, and unmethylated on the maternal allele. But when imprinting is disrupted, it can be methylated on the maternal allele as well, which causes Igf2 to be expressed on both alleles. Since Igf2 is growth promoting, this can cause Wilm's tumor.</div>
