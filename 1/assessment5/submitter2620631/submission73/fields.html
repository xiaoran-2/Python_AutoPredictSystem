    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent.  One of the mechanisms of tumorigenesis is methylation of promoter CpG island of tumor suppressor genes, silencing the genes.  Decitabine demethylates the CpG island of promoter for tumor suppressor genes, turning on these genes.  As a result, tumor suppressor genes slow down the tumor growth.  Decitabine has been used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukemia. <br /><br />Reference: Cancer's Epicenter. The Economist.

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are present in many promoter region, and active genes have demethylated CpG islands.  DNA methylation of the CpG islands silent the genes.  In cancer, the CpG islands are heavily methylated.  Hypermethylation of CpG islands in tumor suppressor gene promoters would silent the genes, and such changes would cause unregulated proliferation, leading to cancer.<br /><br />In normal cells, DNA methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements stabilizes the genome.  In cancer, there is progressive demethylation of the intergenic regions and repetitive elements.  As a result, the DNA becomes unstable, leading to deletion, insertion, reciprocal translocation of the chromosomes often seen in certain types of cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Alteration of DNA methylation in imprint control region (ICR) can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes and overexpression of growth promoting genes, leading to unregulated growth and cancer.  Let me use the example of H19/Igf2 cluster.  Normally, ICR of paternal allele in the H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated, blocking the binding of CTCF protein.  Because CTCF is an insulator protein which insulates downstream enhancers from activating Igf2, DNA methylation of paternal ICR not only allows expression of Igf2, but also spread the methylation to the promoter of H19, silencing the gene..  On the other hand, the ICR of maternal allele in the H19/Igf2 cluster is unmethylated, allowing the binding of CTCF protein and blocking the expression of Igf2 by downstream enhancers.  Insulation by CTCF also allows expression of H19 by making it accessible to downstream enhancers.  As a result, there is a balance between growth promoting Igf2 and growth restricting H19 genes.  In Wilm's tumor, the maternal ICR and H19 promoter are methylated.  As a result, CTCF protein no longer blocks the action by downstream enhancers to Igf2 in maternal allele, resulting in overexpression of Igf2 and loss of expression of H19.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation and alteration in the DNA methylation are mitotically heritable.  Epigenetic drugs demethylate the DNA, and as a result, the alterations in the methylation in the cancer cells are passed onto the daughter cells.  Therefore, epigenetic drugs that alter DNA methylation have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment.<br /><br />Developmentally, epigenetic reprogramming -- demethylation of the whole genome and selective methylation -- occurs during early embryogenesis and germ cell development.  These are sensitive periods, as environmental stress can affect the reprogramming.  Treatment with epigenetic drug alters the DNA methylation similar to the epigenetic reprogramming occurring during the sensitive periods.  Methylation of the promoter silences the tumor suppressor gene, leading to unregulated proliferation and cancer.  Treatment with epigenetic drug induces sensitive period of the cancer cells, and turning on tumor suppressor genes, including the daughter cells, would slow down the growth and division of cancer cells.  Because the chemotherapy primarily kills tumor cells during mitosis, the cancer may be resistant to chemotherapy during the sensitive period.  Therefore, it is not advisable to treat the cancer during this sensitive period.<br /><br />Reference: Cancer's Epicenter. The Economist.
