    <div class="field-value"><span>DNA methylation occurs through addition of the methyl group to the 5th C-atom of cytosine in Cp-G dinucleotides with the help of enzymes DNMT3a&amp;b and is mitotically inherited because of the DNMT1 enzyme. It contributes to X-inactivation in female mammals, heterochromatin formation and gene imprinting.DNA methylation is considered an inactive epigenetic mark, and CpGIs located at promoter regions are usually protected from it to avoid the gene silencing. The gene silencing happens due to MeCP1&amp;2 proteins binding to the methylated CpGIs, and then either directly repressing transcription or mediating the condensation of chromatin and preventing transcription factors from binding to the promoter.<br />Both, hyper- and hypomethylation, can cause cancer - hypermethylation happening in the promoters of, and hence, silencing tumour supressor genes controlling cell development and apoptosis. Certain genes (e.g.RB, BRCA1) cause tumogenesis not only due to mutations occurring in them, but also hypermethylation. Hypermethylation of adjacent regions of approximately 2 kb length should be considered. Besides, CIMP is identified when hypermethylation of a set of genes occurs. Specificity of all these cases for different tumour types as well as their use for cancer prognosis, diagnosis and treatment, is noteworthy. <br /> Hypomethylation of prooncogenes activates them and provokes tumogenesis, e.g. activated mip21 targets TSG PTEN, resulting in glioma.<br /></span>Genone-wide hypomethylation in cancer specifically targets intergenic and repetitive regions, which are normally methylated to ensure the genomic stability. Thus the risk of transpositions,  wrong recombinations and other chromosomal aberrations increases. DNMT null cells are genomically unstable. If defects of DNMTs are induced in specific cell lineages, cancer of those tissues develops -e.g. DNMT3b defect causes ICF syndrome. Hypomethylation of repeats and intergenic intervals increases the risk of cancer,  as due to the chromosomal aberrations, frequent transpositions, the genes controlling normal development become disrupted, or vice versa, cryptic promoters of prooncogenes become activated.<br /><br /><p><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Genomic imprinting implies different expression of parental alleles and involves mostly genes controlling growth and development of an organism. These genes expressed either from maternal or paternal chromosome are under the control of ICRs. Epigenetic marking of parental alleles occurs in the germline and is mitotically heritable to maintain imprinting.<br />ICRs are differentially methylated, depending which allele is expressed. E.g. H19-Igf2 locus on chromosome 11 in human is regulated by a set of enhancers. On the maternal chromosome ICR of the H19 gene is not methylated, so CTCF-insulator binds to it, enhancers located ahead of the H19 gene are activated, H19 gene is transcribed but Igf2  gene is repressed. On the paternal chromosome methylation of H19 promoter silences this gene, methylation of ICR prevents CTCF from binding, and enhancers let the expression of Igf2,  while H19 is repressed.<br />Methylation of ICRs on the maternal chromosome causes loss of imprinting. H19 gene stops cell proliferation, the Igf2 gene is a growth promoter. So, silencing of H19 and double expression of the Igf2 gene leads to Wilm's tumour.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine (comercial name is Dacogen) is a DNA-demethylating drug used in the treatment of myeloid leukemia and myelodisplastic syndromes. It inhibits methyltransferases and causes hypomethylation. This, in turn, activates, tumor supressor genes, preventing the development of cancer through apoptosis of tumour cells. It was shown that  primarily it is phosphorylated, and then incorporated into the DNA instead of cytosine. (Int. J.Cancer:123,8-13 (2008)). Normally the C-G dinucleotide is recognised by the DNA methyltransferases, so the newly formed dinucleotide of azacytosine-guanine is also recognised by the enzyme which binds to it, but due to the structural differences its function is then blocked.Though the fact that in vitro experiments on the mixed culture of cells (healthy and cancer) the normal cells are not affected by the drug makes the research promising,  transport of the drug via the cell membranes is not clearly understood yet. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenome is a set of factors that can affect the genome altering the gene expression. So called epigenetic marks are involved in normal processes, such as the cell differentiation, and development of diseases. Three main categories of epigenetic factors are DNA methylation, histone modification and non-coding RNA which either directly affect genes or mediate the alteration of gene expression. DNA methylation can have a profound effect on  genes activating (hypomethylation) or deactivating them (hypermethylation). The fact that DNA methylation is species- and tissue-specific is of great importance. It is noteworthy that cancer-associated DNA methylation also varies in extent, frequency and cancer type.<br />A sensitive period of development is  when the organism is "more receptive to the environmental stimuli", as these periods are marked with profound changes of biological and/or behavioral constitution. In terms of epigenetics, it will be stages when the epigenetic marks are set- preimplantation period/early embrionic cells and germline cells. As drugs such as inhibitor GSK2816126 or azacitidine act as DNA-demethylating factors, others affect histone deacetylase,  application of these chemicals during sensitive periods may interfere with the normal arrangement of epigenetic marks. Long-lasting effects of these drugs is probably based on mitotic heritability of epigenetic marks.</div>
