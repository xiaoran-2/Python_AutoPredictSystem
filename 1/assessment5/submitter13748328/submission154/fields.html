    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normally CpG islands are hypomethylated but in cancer this CpG island are hypermethylated so it leads to silencing of genes , one of genes that can be silenced are the tumor suppressing genes while the repetitive elements and intergenic regions are normally methylated in gene but in cancer this methylation is removed and the intergenic regions and repetitive elemts are hypomethylated causing genome instability. This genome instability can lead to illegitimate recombination between repeats , activation of repeats and transposition ,  chromosomal deletions , reciprocal translocation or insertion  leading  to cancer.   </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprinting control region ( ICR) is unmethylated on the paternal allele so CTCF which acts as insulator won't bind to it and the enhancer will bind to Igf2 so induce the expression of Igf2 . while ICR is methylated on the maternal allele so CTFC will bind to it and acts as insulator silencing the expression of Igf2 . Instead enhancers will  bind to H19 inducing its expression. In Wilm's tumor, ICR is methylated as well on the maternal allele as in the paternal allele this leads to the expression of Igf2 from both alleles so its expression is higher than normal . This disruption leads to cancer as Igf2 acts as growth promoter.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is DNA demethylating agent. Decitabine  inhibits DNA methyl transferase so inhibit further methylation of CPG islands so keep them unmethylted . Decitabine keep the tumor suppresor gene active so it can have an anti tumor  effect .</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic changes are passed on  during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are erased <br />Sensitive periods are periods where there is extensive reprogramming remodelling in genes.<br />The sensitive periods durings development are during primordial germ cell development and early development.</div>
