    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>In normal
(non-malignant) cells, CpG islands are usually not methylated. However, there
could be tissue-specific and developmental stage-specific methylation in these
sites which allows fine regulation of gene expression. In contrast, methylation
occurs more frequently in CpGs located in intergenic regions and in repetitive
elements. DNA methylation in these latter sites contributes also to regulate
gene expression and to preserve genomic stability. In cancer cells,
DNA-methylation shows the opposite profile, i.e. the CpG islands are
hypermethylated and there is an overall hypomethylation in intergenic regions
and repetitive elements. As a result of this, expression of tumor suppressor genes
is silenced and oncogene expression is enhanced leading to cancer progression.
Also, the lack of DNA methylation at repetitive elements leads to genomic
instability due to an increase in the frequency of deletions, insertions and
aberrant recombination of chromosomes. Genomic instability causes mutations,
which also contribute to cancer.    </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The paternal
allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster shows methylation at the Imprint Control Region
(ICR) site, whereas the maternal allele is not methylated at this site. This unmethylated
state in the maternal allele allows the binding of CTCF protein which in turn
blocks the binding to enhancer sites which are necessary to express the Igf2
gene. As a result, Igf2 is not expressed from the maternal allele. In the
paternal allele, methylation at ICR does not allow CTCF to bind and instead, interaction
with enhancers induces Igf2 expression. In Wilm’s tumor, there is a loss of
imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster, i.e. the maternal allele also shows
methylation at the ICR, so binding to CTCF is not possible and Igf2 is
expressed from both paternal and maternal alleles. This 2-fold expression of
Igf2 promotes an increased growth of the affected tissue, in this case, the kidney.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine
is a DNA-methyltransferase inhibitor. It causes DNA-demethylation in a
replication-dependent manner, so it takes advantage from the increased rate of
replication of cancer cells to cause an anti-tumor effect. By removing methyl
groups from hypermethylated CpG islands, for example, drugs like Decitabine may
activate the expression of otherwise silenced tumor suppressor genes in cancer
cells. Since DNA-methylation is inheritable, by removing this inactivating
epigenetic mark in one cancer cell, altered expression of tumor suppressor genes
or imprinted genes could be reestablished in daughter cells and this may slow
down tumor growth.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Since DNA-methylation is inheritable, by removing this inactivating
epigenetic mark in one cancer cell, altered expression of genes can be
reestablished in the subsequent generations of daughter cells. This could at least slow down tumor growth, and may improve the action of standard chemotherapeutic drugs, perhaps by reducing the number of cells which have to be eliminated. A sensitive period could be defined as a
particular moment in development when epigenetic reprogramming occurs, for
example, early-embryonic development as well as generation and maturation of
primordial germ cells. Treating patients with epigenetic drugs during these
sensitive periods may alter reprogramming and therefore gene expression of
germ cells which could result in other inheritable epigenetic disorders or in sub-fertility.</span></p></div>
