    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are most frequently found in gene promoters.  Methylation of the CpG island can result in silencing of the gene.  A primary mechanism of silencing is the formation of a repressive chromatin structure.   A less common secondary mechanism for silencing occurs when meCpG prohibits transcriptional factors from binding.<br /><br />DNA methylation of CpG islands by disrupted in two ways, either hypermethylated or hypomethylated.  Hypermethylation of CpG islands and CpG island shores is more common and increases with age.  This hypermethylation may result in cancer when the CpG island is found in the promoter of a tumor suppression gene.  This hypermethylation becomes mitotically heritable resulting in a cell lineage with inactive tumor suppression genes.  This may result in a tumor.  Also possible is the hypomethylation of an oncogene.  A loss of methylation in the promoter of this gene may also result in controlled cell division and result in a tumor.<br /><br />Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are also usually methylated, and, therefore, usually silenced.  By silencing intergenic regions and repetitive elements, genomic stability is maintained.  When Dmnt1 is removed from various tissue types, and intergenic regions lose their methylation, chromosomal abnormalities occur such as deletions, translocations, insertions, and duplications.  Methylated intergenic regions can also silence cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites.  Silencing repetitive elements helps prevent transposons.  By preventing transposons, the cell can avoid transcriptional interference or illegitimate recombination.  <br /><br />DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted by the removal of the methyl groups.  Hypomethylating these regions can activate repeats and transposons.  This may disrupt genes or activate cryptic promoters and neighboring genes.  If a repeat activates an oncogene, cancer may result.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the paternal allele of the Igf2 gene, the ICR (imprint control region) is methylated.  This methylation blocks binding of the CTCF protein at the ICR.  Without CTCF, the DNA methylation spreads to the H19 promoter and silences this gene.  With H19 silenced, enhancers can access Igf2 and activate it.<br /><br />In the maternal allele of the Igf2 gene, the ICR is unmethylated.  Therefore, CTCF, an insulator protein, binds to the ICR.  This allows the transcription of the H19 gene.  H19 interferes with the enhancers and blocks Igf2 from being activated.<br /><br />When the MATERNAL allele is disrupted, the ICR becomes methylated.  CTCF becomes blocked, methylation spreads, H19 promoter is silenced, and enhancers can reach Igf2 and activate it.  The individual essentially has disomy of the gene and overproduce the protein.<br /><br />Igf2 is a growth promoting gene.  By having two activated copies of the gene, cell growth is drastically enhances and may result in a tumor.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a Dnmt inhibitor.<br /><br />Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase.  It irreversibly binds DNMT after it is incorporated into the DNA.  It is a replication dependent inhibitor and is therefore more effective in cancer cells due to the uncontrolled rate of cell division.<br /><br />Decitabine can have an anti-tumor effect by demethylating the promoter of a tumor suppressor gene.  By removing methyl groups, the tumor suppressor gene is reactivated and can then regulate cell growth and reproduction.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because it is mitotically heritable and therefore passed on and maintained by future generations of daughter cells.  <br /><br />A sensitive period is a time of epigenetic reprogramming, specifically pre-implantation early embryo development and primordial germ cell development.  During epigenetic reprogramming many, but not all, epigenetic marks are cleared and reset for the developing offspring or germ cell.  <br /><br />Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because these are important times in establishing epigenetic marks for developing offspring or primordial germ cells.  Many epigenetic marks are cleared during this time.  If this did not occur, offspring would suffer from cummulative marks acquired over generations.  Just as important are that methylated repeats are not removed or reset.  Also, imprinted genes are only reprogrammed during primordial germ cell development.  Any disruption to the epigenetic marks in any of these areas can result in organism-wide cellular malfunctions.  <br /></div>
