    <div class="field-value"><div>[Ideas extracted from Module7 material]<br /><br />Normal tissues have high methylation levels. An aberrant epigenetic control can contribute to evading growth suppressors, genome instability and sustaining proliferative signaling (hallmarks of cancer).There is locus specific DNA hypermethylation and genome-wide DNA hypomethylation. <br />In normal cells, we normally find unmethylated CpG islands (CGI) and the genome is generally methylated in repetitive elements, introns of genes and intergenic regions. Exactly the opposite is found in cancer cells. CGI hypermethylation is normally found in the promoter of tumour suppressor genes (TSGs).<br />DNA methylation is an alternative to genetic mutations for TSGs silencing. It occurs frequently in tumours, where this epimutations (reversible as opposite to normal mutations) are rapidly selected because provides any advantage (i.e.faster replication). TSGs hypermethylation is often more frequent than mutations. <br />Genome-wide DNA methylation profiles are unique to tumour subtypes. Also, DNA methylation alterations increase with age and CGI methylation progresses with time.<br />Locus-specific DNA hypermethylation: (RB in retinoblastoma; BRCA1 in breast cancer) Hypermethylated genes in tumour tissue could be used as biomarkers.</div><div>CGI of sets of genes are frequently methylated in cancer (hypermethylated islands differ in tumor types). <br />Both Locus-specific DNA hypermethylation and panels of biomarkers can be used for diagnosis (even to distinguish tumour subtypes), prognosis and monitor tumour decline or recurrence (analyzing blood cells or free DNA in blood).<br />If CGI are hypermethylated in cancer, so the CGI shores (+/- 2 kb) are. <br />Hypomethylation in repetitive elements or intergenic leads to illegitimate recombination between repeats [apart from genetic similarity, it needs open chromatin (achieved with low levels of methylation)]. <br /></div><div>DNA methylation depletion from TSGs leads to tumorigenesis suppresion. However, demethylation can also lead to chromosomal instability and enhance tumorigenesis. <br />H4k16ac (activation) and H4K20me (repressive) are decreased in repetitive regions of cancer cells.</div><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">[Ideas taken from the material taught during the course].<br /><br />Loss of impriting means that, contrarily to the normal situation, both parental alleles are silenced or expressed. <br />Depending on the imprinting control regions (ICRs) being analyzed, we can find hyper or hypomethylation of ICRs. <br />In the case of Igf2/H19: <br />In normal cells, ICR is methylated on the paternal allele. Therefore, CTCF cannot bind to the ICR and enhancers act on Igf2. Contrarily, Igf2 is silenced from the maternal allele (unmethylated ICR allows CTCF binding and, therefore, enhancers act on H19 expression). <br />With loss of impriting, both maternal and paternal alleles are methylated, leading to a double dose of Igf2 expression (promoting excessive growth and thus, cancer (Wilm´s tumour)).<br />Hyper or hypomethylation of ICRs might be early events in tumorigenesis.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is one type of "epigenetic drug" normally sold as "Dacogen" by Eisai (a Japanese company) used to 
treat myelodysplastic syndromes [precursors of acute myelogenous 
leukaemia]. Decitabine hypomethylates DNA (= demethylating agent) [<span>1]</span> by inhibiting DNA methyltransferases. Epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable.Once the epigenetic marks are erased (=DNA demethylation),
 they do not return. Thus, epigenetic therapies might produce changes that could stop a cancer growing (=anti-tumour effect).<br /><br />Ideas taken from:<br />-The article itself<br />- [1] <span><a title="Link: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/</a><b>12879469</b></span>]<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">[Material learnt throughout the course]<br /><br />Epigenetic reprogramming = Clearing and resetting epigenetic marks. <br />Heritability is countered by periods when epigenetic marks are removed.There are two waves of reprogramming: Primordial germ cell development and pre-implantation period (early embryonic development).These periods of epigenetic reprogramming are known as "sensitive periods". <br />DNA methylation is rapid and active in the case of the paternal genome and passive for the maternal genome. After implantation, epigenetic marks are re-established in a lineage-specific manner.<br /><div>DNA methylation is also involved in gene imprinting. Many imprinted 
genes are involved in growth. Therefore, loss of imprinting (loss of DNA
 methylation) is a common feature of cancer. Importantly, imprinted gene
 expression is not always found in all tissues.<br /></div>Epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable.Therefore, if we treat patients with epigenetic drugs during sensitive periods and something goes wrong (i.e. a epigenetic mark is erased when it shouldn´t have been erased), there is no turning back: this mark would pass onto daughter cells (that is, an effect that would last beyond the period of drug treatment and would have an impact in all subsequent cell progeny) and can have tremendous negative consequences.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
