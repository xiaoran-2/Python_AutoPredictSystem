    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Decitabine belongs to the class of epigenetic inhibitors called DNA demethylating agents. decitabine causes the hypomethylation of DNA and it does so by inhibiting DNA Methyl Transferases, which are required for the regulation of gene expression.</div><div>it is evident that most of the cancers have a hypermethylated CpG islands and Histone proteins whose effect extends to the nearby tumor suppressor genes, which in turn are silenced. Decitabine works as an anticancer drug firstly by reducing the methlyation of DNA by inhibiting DNMTs (when administered at lower concentration), thereby reversing epimutations and restoring tumor suppressor gene function and secondly since decitabine is a deoxy derivative of azacytidine, an analog of cytidine, by getting incorporated into the DNA during synthesis (at higher concentrations). The decitabine incorporated into the DNA interacts with DNMTs and blocks further DNA synthesis, thus causing cytotoxicity to the rapidly dividing tumor cells. thus it has anti-tumor activity</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>DNA Methylation marks are mitotically heretible, means they are passed on through generations, moreover these epimutations are reversible in nature, so using drugs, once reversed will be maintained for generations.</div><div>However, these epigenetic marks can be erased and they are erased during the normal developmental stages of organism.</div><div>There are periods when cells undergo major epigenetic remodelling or reprogramming, these are called sensitive periods because any environmental alterations during this phase directly influence the epigenetic control. pre and post implantation embryo and development of primordial germ cells are the 2 periods cells are sensitive to environment so much so that the effect of diet, temperature, exposure to certain chemicals can have a direct impact on the epigenome of the organism and its progeny.</div><div>if drugs that alter the epigenetic makeup of the cells are administered during these periods will cause numerous implications like, aberrations in establishing lineage specific methlyation marks during gastrulation, sex specific epigenetic marks during PGC development, abnormalities to the new born, etc can lead to various forms of cancer, diseases, and even have transgenerational epigenetic effects on subsequent progeny. moreover the outcome of such treatment could be fatal to the organism as well, thus inadvisable.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>1) CpG islands are usually found in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes, when a CpG island is methylated it switches off the expression of the underlying gene.</div><div>2) for a normal cell to become a cancer cell its takes a cumulative effect of genetic or now more recent epigenetic changes occuring at multiple places in the genome, briefly by mechanisms like genome wide hypomethylation of intergenic and repetitive elements causing genome instability and subsequent oncogene activation, tumor suppressor hypermethlyation. the means by which this happens could be due to random probability of alteration in epigenetic machinery or stress on cells and then those changes are selected into further generation, but basically by causing genome instability.</div><div>3) Genome wide hypomethylation usually occurs at repeats but occasionally also occurs at CpG poor promoters, these promoters drive the expression of oncogene, in a normal cell its methylated and tightly regulated and silenced thus disruption in the mehtylation of CpG islands in these promoters leads to activation of oncogene and cancer.</div><div>4) the normal function of methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to maintain genomic stability, in cancer however these regions are actively hypomethylated. and </div><div>5) reasons how DNA methylation at these regions is disrupted in cancer could be a mutation or epimutation of chromatin modifier enzymes like DNMTs, HMTs, HATs, etc silencing them thereby leading to hypomethylation of these regions.</div><div>6) when a normal cell undergoes hypomethylation of these intergenic/repetitive regions it leads to genomic instability which is best characterized by occurrence of abnormal karyotype, events of insertion, deletion, translocation, due to illegitimate recombination, activation of transposition elements, cryptic promoters, activation of oncogenes and disruption of tumor suppressor function. all these events drive the transformation of normal cells to neoplastic to tumor cells (contributes to cancer).</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>1) the paternal allele for the H19/Igf2 cluster, its imprint control region is methylated, this blocks the binding of a insulator protein called CTCF to itself, this causes the methylation to extends into the CpG of H19 promoter downstream. the enhancers are now only able to access the Igf2 gene, activating it.  </div><div>2) maternal allele for the same, its imprint control region is not methylated which allows CTCF to physically insulate/block the enhancers from accessing the Igf2 gene locus upstream of ICR thus the Igf2 is silenced</div><div>3) when there are abnormalities in these clusters it leads to imprinting disorder called Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome characterized by absence/loss of a tumor suppressor gene and overexpression of growth promoting Igf2 gene. this is caused by mutations or deletions in the ICR so that there is absence of imprinting, or by uniparental disomy meaning when the maternal allele behaves like the paternal allele in which case, both alleles look like paternal ones and cells would produce a double dose of Igf2. </div><div>4) So due to loss of the tumor suppressor gene and excess of oncogene expression the condition eventually leads to natal overgrowth, embryonic tumors, one known is called Wilm's tumor</div></div>
