    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation of CpG islands and in intergenic
regions and repetitive elements is altered in cancer.  </span></p>

<p>Under normal circumstances, the DNA at CpG islands
in the cell is hypomethylated (no methylation). This allows for the expression
of tumour suppressors, which inhibit cancerous tumour growth. </p>

<p>In contrast, cancerous cells display a “reciprocal cross”,
in that there is hypermethylation of the CpG islands (and no methylation of intergenic
regions or repetitive elements or gene introns which are normally methylated). This
leaves the cell more vulnerable to tumour growth due to the silencing of tumour
suppressor expression. </p>

<p><span>CpG islands are frequently found in the promoters of
tumour suppressor genes. DNA methylation and subsequent DNA silencing of tumour
suppressor genes is an effective epigenetic method of allowing cancerous cells
to disrupt the normal tumour suppression mechanisms and thereby have an
advantage over surrounding normal cells which allow them to not die/take over
(metastasize).  CpG island hypermethylation
also tends to increase as a cancer continues to grow, accentuating tumour
growth in an exponential manner. </span></p>

<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements in the
DNA are normally hypermethylated. The methylation and dense packing of the
chromatin helps to maintain genetic integrity. </p>

<p>Hypomethylation of repeating regions occurs in most
cells contributing to tumours, and progresses with time. Hypomethylation opens
up repetitive regions to more active transcription. </p>

<p><span>Deletions, reciprocal translocations and insertions
are all examples of adherent outcomes leading to cancer as the cryptic
promoters can become active, causing genomic instability. Repeats can undergo illegitimate
transpositions in cases of hypomethylation where the DNA is not densely
packaged (heterochromatinized) and therefore exposes repeating areas which can
link up inappropriately (misaligned). 
These repeats can also make copies of themselves and either jump and
insert themselves into the genome, or cause abnormal activation of surrounding
gene transcription, leading to cancerous cell states. </span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Disruption or loss of imprinting can contribute to cancer when hypo- or hypermethylation
results in genes that should be displaying mono-allelic parent-of-origin
expression become either expressed or silent on both parental alleles.  Many examples of disruption-of-imprinting
affect genes that are somehow involved in growth.</span></p>

<p><span>The H19/Igf2 cluster is an example where hypermethylation affects the imprint
control regions.  </span></p>

<p>On paternal alleles, upstream imprint control region (and one end of
the H19 gene) are methylated. Therefore the insulator element of the imprint
control region is silenced and “enhancers” are free to promote normal
Igf2 gene expression.</p>

<p>Conversely, maternal alleles have the unmethylated imprint control regions.
This allows CTCF to bind onto the insulator element, facilitating enhancers
to stimulate expression of unmethylated H19 gene. But Igf2 is not expressed.</p>

<p>Wilm’s tumour (a childhood kidney-related cancer) is
associated with loss of imprinting due to hypermethylation on imprint
control region of maternal alleles (normally unmethylated). Therefore maternal alleles look/behave just like paternal alleles, and express Igf2.</p>

<span>As a result of this imprinting disruption, there
is a double dose of Igf2 compared to what's seen in normal cells.  Since Igf2 is associated with growth
promotion, double doses are associated with Wilm’s tumours. </span><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of epigenetic inhibitors
known as DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi). This hypomethylation agent
is a nucleoside analogue which gets incorporated into the DNA upon replication.
</p>

<p>Decitabine's hypomethylating impact on DNA occurs by inhibiting
methyltransferase.  When DNA methyltransferase
travels along the genome to bind at the point where Decitabine has been incorporated, the methyltransferase becomes irreversibly bound to the DNA and can
no longer be released, preventing the epigenetically-induced cancerous methylated
state from being passed on to daughter cells.  </p>

<p>Decitabine is one of the most advanced drugs for epigenetic cancer
therapy, used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes (the precursors of acute
myelogenous leukaemia).</p>

<p>At lower doses, Decitabine has had as successful anti-tumour
effect by reverting an epigenetic mutation (the abnomal hypermethylated state of tumour
suppressor genes). Once subsequent cells are hypomethylated/demethylated (back
to the healthy state), tumour suppressor genes are expressed and able to restore cancer
proliferation control. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Because alterations
in DNA methylation status will persist in the epigenome of the patient
through generations of cell division, epigenetic drug effects on tumour cells
can be more long lasting than conventional chemotherapy. </p>

<p><span>Risk/rewards would have to be weighed carefully before applying epigenetic
drugs during sensitive periods when DNA methylation and histone markers previously removed throughout most of the genome are restored. (Therefore the
epigenome is at risk of not being accurately returned to its original status if
drugs interfer with the DNA remethylation process.)  </span></p>

<p>Sensitive
periods/epigenetic reprogramming occur at the end of the early development
period, when the embryo implants/forms a blastocyst) as
well as just after primordial germ cell development, when spermatogenesis or
oogenesis take place to form gametes.</p>

<p><span>Drug treatments
are not advisable during sensitive periods when epigenetic marks are being reset.
 Drug interactions that alter the epigenome
by altering the methylation state of areas of the DNA would persist in the
genome for generations since epigenetic changes are passed on to daughter cells in
the individual through mitosis and to future generations via the gametes through meiosis. Altering the methylation state
beyond the targeted gene area could result in unintended yet negative
consequences for the patient. </span></p>
