    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA
methylation is a well-studied modification that involves the addition of methyl
groups to cytosine bases present in the dinucleotide sequence
cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG). The human genome contains small stretches, of
at least 200 base pairs (bp) in length, that are rich in CpG dinucleotides
termed CpG islands. The CpG dinucleotides in these islands are usually
unmethylated. In cancer cells, however, promoter CpG islands tend to be
hypermethylated. This hypermethylation then in turn causes silencing of the
essential gene. Repetitive elements (REs) and intergenic regions make up half
of the human genome and contain about 50% of all CpG dinucleotides in the
genome. These REs and intergenic regions are generally highly methylated and
are associated with maintenance of chromosome structure and genome integrity.
In cancer cell lines there is a hypomethylation of REs and intergenic regions
and as a result transposable elements become active and contribute to the
genomic instability. <span>Instantaneously,
cancer cells exhibit hypermethylation within the promoter regions of many CpG
island-associated tumor suppressor genes. Consequently, these regulatory genes
are transcriptionally silenced resulting in a loss-of-function. Therefore,
through the effects of both hypo- and hyper-methylation, DNA methylation
significantly affects the genomic landscape of cancer cells. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The maternally-expressed H19
gene and paternally-expressed Igf2 gene share enhancers and their reciprocal
imprinting is directed by a CTCF-dependent insulator that is located between
the genes. On the paternal allele, <span>methylation
at the ICR not only prevents CTCF from binding, allowing <i>Igf2</i> to
engage the enhancers, but it is also essential for methylation at the <i>H19</i> promoter
and silencing of <i>H19</i>. On the maternal allele, CTCF binds to 4
binding sites inside the ICR, creating an insulator that prevents <i>Igf2</i> from
accessing the shared enhancers that are located on the <i>H19</i> side
of the insulator. As a result, the insulator effectively acts as an
enhancer-blocker. In Wilm’s tumour there is a hypermethylation of ICR,
therefore there is an overexpression of Igf2. This means that on the maternal
allele Igf2 is engaged with enhancers instead of Igf2 being prevented to access
enhancers.  </span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine, also known as 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, is a hypomethylating
agent. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase (DNMT).<span> Decitabine
decreases DNA methylation by promoting proteosomal degradation of DNMT. Decitabine
produces its anticancer effects by causing a chemical reaction that damages the
DNA in a cell. The DNA damage caused by decitabine inhibits protein synthesis
and results in cellular death.<span> </span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs can alter gene expression by direct and indirect mechanisms. Direct
effects can be caused by drugs such as antihypertensive hydralazine, which
inhibit DNA methylation. Indirect effects can be caused by drugs such as isotretinoin,
which have transcription factor activity. In this mechanism, acute exposure to
a drug influences signalling pathways which may lead to an alteration of
transcription factor activity at gene promoters. This stimulation results in
the altered expression of receptors, signalling molecules, and other proteins essential
to alter genetic regulatory circuits. With more chronic exposure, there is a
cell adaptation which leads to more permanent modifications to DNA methylation
and chromatin structure and as a result enduring alteration of a given
epigenetic network. Therefore, any epigenetic side-effect caused by a drug may
persist after the drug is discontinued. </p>

<p><span>Sensitive periods are defined as periods of epigenetic reprogramming.
Epigenetic reprogramming occurs in early development and in primordial germ
cell development. Any alterations or removal of the normal process can result
in epigenetic abnormalities, mostly aberrant imprinting, therefore treating
patients with drugs that can alter gene expression during these sensitive periods
would be doing more damage than good. </span></p></div>
