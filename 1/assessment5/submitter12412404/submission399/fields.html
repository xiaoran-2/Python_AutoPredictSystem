    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is associated with gene regulation through interfering with the binding capacity of transcription factors to certain regions on the genome. The two main types of DNA methylation that are characteristic to cancer cells are (i) locus-specific hypermethylation, and (ii) genome-wide hypomethylation. <br />Locus-specific hypermethylation most commonly occurs in otherwise unmethylated CpG islands in promoter regions of tumour supressor genes. These areas are normally hypomethylated, so that the tumor suppressor genes are expressed. In cancer, hypermethylation of the CpG islands of these promoter regions results in the de-activation of tumour supressor genes, hence releasing the cell from control of cell division. Hypermethylation on CpG islands of single genes can cause different types of cancers, e.g. the RB in retinoblastoma, or the MLH1 in colorectal cancer. Some cancers are characterised by the hypermethylation of sets of genes, e.g. colorectal cancer CIMP. Notable loci other than CpG islands where hypermethylation can cause cancer are Imprint Control Regions (ICRs). Hypermetylation in these regions lead the disruption of imprinting patterns, and hence either both, or none of the parental copies of the imprinted gene in question will be activated - depending on how the expression of the imprinted genes is regulated.<br />Genome-wide DNA hypomethylation occurs in intergenic regions, introns, repetitive regions, and CpG-poor promoters. These regions are normally methylated to suppress their activity. For example, in the case of repetitive regions, to stop the transcription of non-coding RNAs and the transposition of the repeats; or in the case of CpG-poor promoters, to inhibit the expression of the associated oncogenes. Once methyl groups are lost on these regions, transposon activity increases and leads to genomic instability, and oncogene expression is upregulated. Hypomethylation can also occur on some ICRs, leading to the loss of imprinting, just as in the case of the hypermethylation of these regions. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">H19/Igf2 is a gene cluster that is expressed in a mono-allelic, parent of origin manner. Igf2 is a growth promoting gene, that is only expressed on the paternal allele in normal cells. The ICR of the complex is unmethylated in the maternal allele, and methylated in the paternal allele. The unmethylated allele allows an insulator protein, called CTCF, to bind to the DNA and inhibit the expression of Igf2 on the maternal copy by blocking it from downstream enhancers. These in turn enhance the expression of a long non-coding RNA, H19, the gene of which is located between the Igf2 gene and the enhancers. On the paternal allele, however, CTCF cannot bind to the methylated ICR, allowing the enhancers to promote the expression of Igf2, since this is the preferred loop created by the enhancer regions.<br />In Wilm's tumor, the maternal allele also becomes methylated, and acts the same way as the paternal allele. Therefore twice as much Igf2 is produced as in normal cells, leading to abnormal growth, usually in kidney cells of infants.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor that can be used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes that develop into acute myelogenous leukaemia. Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue that gets incorporated into the DNA, and binds DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) enzymes irreversibly. These enzymes normally copy the methylation pattern from one DNA strand to the other when cells divide. Once bound by decitabine, DNMT can no longer transfer the methylation pattern to the daughter strand, and the methylation pattern is diluted out as the cells divide. Because proliferating cancer cells divide at higher rates than  other cell types, decitabine affects tumours more than it does healthy cells. While the full mechanism of action of the drug is not yet understood, it is hypothesised that it is particularly effective in  cases where CpG island hypermethylation has poor prognostic outcome, as for example in myelodysplastic syndromes. <br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation state is mitotically heritable, due to the activity of maintenance DNA methyltransferase enzymes. These enzymes copy the DNA methylation pattern from one DNA strand to the other. Therefore once altered in a cell, methylation state will be passed on to daughter cells of the lineage, until it is either actively altered, or passively modified (e.g. through dilution). If this alteration to the metylome results in increased susceptibility of the cells to classic chemoterapy, the effects will last longer then the actual epigenetic drug treatment. While this is extremely promising, there are some sensitive periods in ontogenesis that are best to avoid with epigenetic drugs. During these periods, the epigenetic marks are established de novo, therefore any alteration to these may result in unforeseen abnormalities. In general, the periods of epigenetic reprogramming during  early embryonic development and gametogenesis are systemically sensitive periods, while different organs have different periods of sensitivity. For example, the brain continues to develop after birth in mammals, exposing it to epigenetic changes that can affect the health and behaviour of the individual for its whole life. <br /><br /></div>
