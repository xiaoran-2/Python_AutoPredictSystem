<p>Normally DNA methylation at CpG islands (at the 5′ position of the cytosine ring within CpG dinucleotides) do the following
functions:</p>

<p>Represses the oncogenes expression at these specific sites to
prevent uncontrolled cell division. On the contrary the prevention of
methylation of tumor suppressor genes activates the normal suppression
functions of these genes and prevent tumorigenesis.Additionally DNA methylation helps in controlling cell
cycle according to the cellular needs i.e stop the cycle and allowing DNA
repair or in other situations promote apoptosis. Also, CpG islands are
methylated on X chromosome and inactivate it in female mammals.</p>

<p>The disturbance of the DNA CpG islands methylation
homeostasis may promote carcinogenesis as follows:</p>

<p>Hypermethylation of DNA CpG islands (which are usually
unmethylated) can silence the tumor suppressor genes, Can cause loss of control on cell
cycle, leads to disturbance or loss of apoptosis, and may cause loss of DNA repair mechanisms.</p>

<div>

<p>For example: In colorectal
cancer, there is a high frequency of DNA methylation at CpG islands. Another example
is the de novo methyl transferase, DNMT3a (one of the enzymes which is responsible for DNA methylation) mutation in acute myeloid leukemia
(AML). </p>

<p>The intergenic regions and
repetitive elements promote chromosomal stability and genomic integrity and
they are usually methylated. The hypomethylation of them can lead to
chromosomal instability and increase translocations, insertions, or deletions. These
chromosomal abnormalities may lead to carcinogenesis for example if a part of a
chromosome containing oncogene is translocated into normal gene or into a tumor
suppressor gene, the normal function of these genes will be lost and the cell continue
to divide uncontrollably.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"> 

<div>

<p>In normal cell the area around H19/Igf2
locus is methylated in the paternal allele at the ICR (Imprint Control Regions)
but the maternal allele is not methylated. So that, in the maternal strand the
CTCF complex binds to the allele and the enhancers act on H19 and activate it.
However, the methylation on the paternal allele prevents the CTCF complex from
binding of enhancers on the H19 and instead, activates Igf2 expression i.e the
methyl marks act as insulator from H19 binding. Thus in a normal cell, the
maternal strand show active H19 and the paternal strand shows active Igf2
instead. However, if ICR becomes hypermethylated, both strands look like the
paternal part and the Igf2 growth factor is activated as twice as normal
without any suppressor gene as in Wilm’s tumor. So that the double activation of a growth factor gene expression and inhibition of a tumor suppressor gene may leads to uncontrolled cell division and carcinogenesis.<br /></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">

<p>Decitabine is a cytidine analogue acts as demethylating agent on DNA. The process of DNA
hypermethylation can block the activity of the tumor suppressor genes and
promotes carcinogenesis as in myelodysplastic syndrome. So that, by
demethylating agents as decitabine the tumor suppressor genes are reactivated
and act to stop the tumor progression and can be used to treat myelodysplastic
syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukemia.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>

<p>DNA methylation is a part of
epigenetic processes and it is mitotically heritable but it is reversible so that it is an attractive target for treatments. Additionally once modified, it cannot
be returned. However these types of interfering treatments may alter the normal
biochemical functions of the cell especially during the critical or<b> sensitive
periods which are preimplantation period (or even before fertilization)
and during gametogenesis in males and females</b> and this occurs mainly by reprograming the process of methylation after clearance, so the paternal part undergoes active demethylation and the maternal part undergoes passive demethylation (by dilution effect) . Hence hypomethylation or
hypermethylathion by drugs during these periods can lead to loss or gain of
unsuitable gene function. So that it is not advisable to use these drugs during
these sensitive periods or epigenetic reprograming periods.</p>
