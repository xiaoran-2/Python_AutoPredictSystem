    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is co related to incativation of chromosome or a gene. Unmethylated CpG island are key for a gene expression as DNA transferase and other epigentic marks can easily bind to unmethylated CpG islands,hence expressing the particular gene. Similarly, methylated intergenic regions and repetitive elements helps in silencing of the unwanted genes. In cancer, hypermethylation of CpG islands can result in silencing the good genes for example, tumor supressor genes, thus causing genomic instability, deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes. Whereas, hypomethylation of intergenic regions or repetitive elements can result in triggering the expression of oncogenes i.e growth promoting genes. so overall, these changes result into cell growth or cell division in uncontrolled manner thus changing normal cells into tumor cells.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprinting control region are not correlated to methylation and gene silencing but instead they can help us to find us if the gene is expressed maternally or paternally, for example, expression of Igf2/H19 cluster. ICR and H19 are unmethylated in maternal gene, hence resulting the expression of enhancers which further enhances the expression of H19 gene. Whereas, In paternal allele ICR and H19 are methylated thus supressiing their expression but enhancing the expression of Igf2. so Igf2 is only expressed from paternal allele. but disruption in this cluster can result in loss of Cdnk1c from maternal allele, which is a tumor suppressor gene and also upregulation of Igf2 in paternal allele, which is a growth enhancing gene. thus enhancing the growth overall and causing cancers as in wilm's tumor.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to DNMTi i.e. DNA methyl transferase inhibitors. This drug basically contains DNMTi, which are nucleoside analouges, thus they incoorperate into DNA during replication. When DNA methyl transferase comes to do the methylation of daughter strand, Decitabine binds the DNA methyl transferase irreversible to the the strand, so that it can no longer leave the strand and become unavailable to function further. As, DNMTi are repliction dependent, so to get their best result, cell should be divinding. As cancer cells are rapidly diving cells, so this drug is most effective on tumor cells.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">We know that epigenetic changes pass to the the daughter cells and to granddaughter cells during division and until they are actively erased. So this means, that this can help in stopping the cancer without killig the the cells, as we know that if these carcinogenic epigenetic changes are once erased from the the genome they will never comeback. so, this is how altering DNA methylation can have long lasting effect on epigenome.<br />Also, use of these drug is highly sensitive to the period of development. These drugs are avoided during the sensitive period of development i.e. primordial germ cell development and pre-implantation and post implantation periods. These are the period when active reprogramming of genome occurs i.e. removal and lay down of new epigenome marks occurs during this period. So, Alteration in Epigenome machinery during this period can adversely effect the future generation as well.<br /></div>
