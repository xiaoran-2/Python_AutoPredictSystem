    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value">Normally, CpG islands are unmethylated, allowing gene expression to occur. With cancer, the CpG islands are hypermethylated, which results in gene silencing. This could contribute to cancer, because the DNA hypermethylation in the promotors of the tumor suppressor genes silence these genes. This stops suppressing  tumors. This is mitotically heritable, so when the cell where this occurs, divides the same happens in new cells. The new cells also have a competitive advantage to other cells, so the cells divide more and faster and take over the tissue. These cells that now 'own'  the tissue and the tissue will not suppress tumors anymore.<br />In intergenic regions and repetitive elements, DNA methylation ensures genomic stability. In cancer, hypomethylation results in genomic instability such as illegitimate recombination between repeats, transcription and activation of cryptic promotors and disruption of neighboring genes. In other words: this hypomethylation results in insertions, deletions, reciprocal translocations and a failure to maintain euploidy. How this contributes to cancer is not clear; some suggest oncogene activation or tumor suppressor gene activation, others suggest that this genomic instability leads to a large number of mutations and therefore cancer.<span class="_wysihtml5-temp"></span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The paternal allele s methylated, so enhancers can act on Igf2, because CTCF is not binding insulin to inhibit this; so Igf2 is repressed from the paternal allele. The maternal allele is unmethylated, CTCF binds the insulin element and so the enhancers will act on H19. Igf2 is silent on the maternal allele so there will be no Igf2 expression from this allele. <br />When there is loss of imprinting, there is hypermethylation of the imprint control region on the maternal allele and then there is expression of  Igf2 on the paternal and the maternal allele. This results in a double dose Igf2 in comparison to a normal cell. Igf2 is growth promoting and prevents damaged cells to be destroyed. H19/Igf2 acts on the kidneys , so when this happens in the kidneys because of loss of imprinting, this leads to more cancerous cells that can form Wilm's tumor. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to a class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi's) and therefore contributes to hypomethylation. Because of the anti-neoplastic effect, it kills tumor cells in myelodysplastic syndrome. CpG hypermethylation is associated with poor prognostic outcome. Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue that gets incorporated in the DNA upon replication and then when the DNA methyltransferase come along to bind it, the DNMTi binds the nucleotide to copy the methylation to the daughter cells. The DNA methyltransferase can no longer be released. This results in hypomethylation. This hypomethylation results in restoring control over cell growth and has a cytotoxic effect and this causes death of rapidly dividing cancer cells on the one hand and over a normal function of tumor suppressor genes on the other hand. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic changes,such as altering DNA methylation can be passed on during cell division to daughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, the cells don't return to their original state. Enduring effects are ensured as DNA methyltransferase enzymes preserve methyl marks during mitosis, so in this way the epigenetic marks are passed on to new cells.<br />A sensitive period is a period where extensive epigenetic reprogramming occurs. Example of sensitive periods during developments are the pre-implantation period and the primordial germ cell development period. Later in life, it is during pregnancy and before conception. During these sensitive periods, DNA (de)methylation takes place. Drugs that can alter this (de)methylation can influence (de)methylation in the embryo and/or in the gametes in the embryo. This could lead to a hazard on the child's (or the grandchild's) life such as harming the ordinary function of the system this drug is acting on. This could result in death or handicap for example. Because we don;t know the effects of such drugs at the moment, it is better not to use them during sensitive periods.<br /><br /></div>
