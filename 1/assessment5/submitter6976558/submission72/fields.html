    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value">Methylation of DNA usually occurs on the carbon 5 position of cytosine base and this covalent modification regulates access to DNA due to direct effect of DNA conformation. CpG islands are regions of increased concentration of guanine/cytosine (GC) base steps, frequently occurring on many promoter sites, which regulate gene expression. Under normal conditions CpG islands usually remain unmethylated, DNA is more flexible and in this way the information on the genes' promoters sites is easily accessible. This allows for the proper function of many genes. In cancer however, these regions become methylated and the access to DNA becomes limited. Such limitation leads to silencing of the genes and disrupts the readout of genetic information and malfunction of biological processes resulting in e.g. uncontrolled proliferation. On the other hand, in the intergenic and repetitive elements of the genome, the global hypermethylation is a sign of normal functioning of the cell, while the hypomethylation of DNA in these regions is a marker of cancer and other diseases. As long as hypomethylation of single region would not significantly contribute to cancer, the fact that these elements repeat frequently, the methylation patterns follow. So in the contrary to DNA methylation of specific gene promoters responsible for the proper action of particular genes, the global changes in DNA methylation patterns in repetitive and intergenic regions leads to global changes in DNA conformation and accessibility; this accumulation is strongly associated with multiple cancers and various stages of this disease. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine represents DNA demethylating or hypomethylating agent. Due to its chemical structure, which is very close to cytosine base, this compound is able to be incorporated into the DNA strand during replication. Once DNA methyl transferase enzyme binds to it, it remains bound irreversibly and the proper methylation and detachment of the enzyme does not take place. Detachment through the beta elimination mechanism is disrupted due to the nitrogen atom present at position 5 of this base-mimic. Instead, the enzyme remains bound. As a result, the methylation mark is not set on DNA nor passed to the daughter strand later since the replication is disrupted. The entrapment of enzyme on DNA depletes the number of available methyl group transferases in the environment and lowers the methylation efficiency leading to inhibition of tumor progression. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the H19/Igf2 cluster the imprinting control region is unmethylated on the maternal allele and methylated on the paternal allele. The DNA methylation imprint is then located on the paternal chromosome. The H19 ncRNA region on the maternal chromosome allows for the control of Igf2 expression: under normal conditions active H19 is susceptible to epigenetic modifications, the unmethylated maternal imprint is bound by CTCF proteins and stops the enhancers from promoting the expression of Igf2. On the paternal allele the imprinting region is methylated, CTCF may no longer bind and the enhancers act on Igf2 and promote Igf2 expression from the paternal allele. <br />In Wilm's tumor, the maternal allele corresponds to the paternal pattern of methylation because H19 is methylated. This corresponds to silenced H19 and expression of Igf2 on the maternal chromosome. As a result, Igf2 is expressed on both alleles while H19 is hypermethylated and silenced. Since the H19 gene is considered a tumor suppressor, its methylation and silencing may further lead to fatal carcinogenic effects. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">By the exposure of genetic material to the drugs modifying e.g. DNA methylation or histones acetylation, the epigenetic maps become altered genome-wide. It means that the balance between proper expression of proteins, including receptors, signaling molecules etc. is altered as well. If this exposure prolongs in time, the consequences on the epigenome will remain long in time as well. <br />Sensitive periods are when the epigenome is more susceptible to the changes from the environment than during other times. For example during pregnancy, the environmental factors  directly affect the epigenome of an unborn child. In case of embryo development, the exposure of a mother to the drug therapy that alters epigenetic maps will have strong influence on the baby epigenome as well. If patients are treated with the epigenetic drugs during such sensitive periods the consequences lead to prolonged alterations of their epigenome and in consequence, affect not only their own but also epigenetics of their children and grandchildren.</div>
