    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell DNA methylation has some patterns that are alterated in cancer cells. For example, CpG islands tend to be unmethylated in a normal cell but are hypermethylated in cancer cells; in general, the CpG islands at promotors of tumour supressing genes tend to be hypermethylated, which means that these genes are silenced and in consequence cancer cells can proliferate (actually, there seems to be an increase of CpG islands hypermethylation with the evolution of cancer).<br /><br />Alterations of DNA methylation aren't limited to this hypermethylation at CpG islands and we can see that there is a genome-wide hypomethylation. In a normal cell, repetitive elements and intergenic regions tend to be methylated but are unmethylated in cancer gells. This actually is a problem because methylation isn't only a mean to silencing genes but is important to mantain genome stability as it prevents translocations, deletions and insertions. So well, this instability in genome because of hypomethylation could actually cause cancer and is seen in human cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Genomic imprinting ocurrs when a gene of only one of inherited allele, it could be paternal or maternal, is expressed. A disruption in this process can contribute to developing cancer. For example ther is the disruption of imprinting H19/Igf2 cluster. In a normal cell, the imprinting control region (ICR) of maternal allele is unmethylated, allowing an insulator (CTCF) to join this region which prevents the expression of Igf2 (as enhancers can't access to that region and increase the expression of H19); on the other hand, in the paternal allele that ICR is methylated, the insulator can't join the ICR and the enhancers can access Igf2 gen, so this gen is expressed.<br /><br />So well, in Wilm's tumour the ICR of maternal allele at the H19/Igf2 is hypermethylated so it's like the paternal allele and the imprinting is lost. As a result, there is an increased expression (actually, an overexpression) of Igf2 gen. Igf2 is a growth promoter gen and because of that its overexpression, caused by lost of imprinting, contributes to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor and because of that it actually prevents DNA methylation as it inhibits the enzyme in charge of this process). This drug can have an anti-tumour effect because we see hypermethylation in some specific regions (CpG islands and shores) which can silence tumour supressing genes; so it could reactivate these genes and prevents cancer cells proliferation.<br /><br />This effect is non-specific, which means that normal cells can be affected by Decitabine, but at low doses, this drug only affects cancer cells which is what we want when treating cancer. Because of its mechanism of action, Decitabine is more effective in cancers that have a poor prognosis because of CpG hypermethylation (this happens in myelodysplasic syndrome)</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark and is mitotically heritable, which means that daughter cells, and granddaughter cells as well, will inherit the changes that are produced by drugs that affect this process, so is understandable that they have enduring effects on epigenome. But even though this type of drugs seems to be so effective, there are some periods that it shouldn't be used because they could cause harmful effects on patients. For example, in children that are developing their germ cells they should be avoided as it could affect their future offspring. Actually, as drugs that alter DNA methylation aren't specific and they could affect normal cells and children that are growing (so they cells are actually in constant division) are more susceptible to adverse effects</div>
