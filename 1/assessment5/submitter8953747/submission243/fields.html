    <h1>Submission 243 from Anon (session_user_id: 4f00dcd178db5187097c102783ade6b34b32232f)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to DNA demethylating agents, which are nucleoside analogues, and the impact of it is hypomethylation. It inhibits DNA methlyation by binding irreversibly DNA methyltransferase enzyme after it is incorporated into DNA, so the drug is replication dependent. Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect because tumour cells divide more rapidly than normal cells and demethylating effect will act only on tumour cells than normal ones.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment because<br />epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased.Sensitive period is the time when all epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation are erased and reset.Sensitive periods are early embryonic development and primodial germ cells development.During sensitive period,since DNA methylation marks are erased and reset, there will be no desirable effect in the patients when they are given epigenetic therapies.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normally, ICR of paternal allele is methylated and that of maternal allele is unmethylated.In cancer, when ICR in maternal allele becomes methylated and methylation spread to H19 promotor region to cause it silent and then enhancers can now access Igf2 oncogene to activate(upregulation of Igf2 oncogene).<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normally, DNA methylation of promotor region inversely correlates with gene expression.Exceptions are CpG islands,which constitute 60% of promotors and they are usually kept free of methylation independent of their activity state.<br />In cancers, CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated causing silencing of the underlying gene. Silencing of tumour suppressor genes, which control cell cycle,apoptosis or DNA repair, contributes to cancer.<br />In normal cells, DNA hypermethylation occurs in intergenic regions and repetitive elements causing them to silence.In cancers, these regions tend to be hypomethylated and cause genomic instability and oncogene activation, resulting cancers.<br /></div>
