    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Normally CpG islands are unmethylated or hypomethylated to enable activation of genes, and places like repetitive elements and intergenic regions are hypermethylated to silence dangerous aberrant activity. Cancerous cells are harmful because these features are undone. In cancer CpG islands are hypermethylated which silences tumor suppressor genes, leading to hasty division and the formation of a tumor. Repetitive elements and intergenic regions are hypomethylated, enabling their activation and causing insertions, translocations and deletions of genes. These genetic changes lead to higher incidences of cancer, as illegitimate recombinations, activation of repeats and transposition, and activation of cryptic promoters and disrupted genes lead to instability. These changes are especially dangerous since they are mitotically heritable and will be continued in all daughter cells of the initial cancerous cell. </span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, meaning that it prevents and removes DNA  methylation and therefore leads to a hypomethylated state. Hypomethylation in the genome is associated with DNA activation at CPG islands. Decitabine achieves an anti-tumor effect by re-activating tumor suppressor genes that had become inhibited by hypermethylation, therefore enabling the DNA to protect itself against uncontrolled growth and other tumorous behaviours.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, a cell that was affected by epigenetic drugs will pass on its methylation pattern to all of its daughter cells. This enables enduring changes to exist on the epigenome. <br />Sensitive periods of development are those in which epigenetic reprogramming takes place. These are generally in early development (when the genome is demethylated and imprinted x inactivation is set) and in primordial germ cell development (when somatic marks are removed  on cells that will become germ cells). Treating patients during these sensitive periods increases the chances of introducing imprinting defects, changing ICR methylation, effecting chromatin packing and causing other broad epigenetic abnormalities. Treatment with such drugs should be reserved for times other than these sensitive periods to try and reduce unintended side effects during large-scale epigenetic reprogramming. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Igf2 is paternally imprinted. The imprint control region is methylated on the paternal allele, blocking CTCF and spreading methylation to H19 to inhibit it. Without H19, the downstream enhancers are not blocked from affecting Igf2, and therefore Igf2 is expressed and enhanced. On the maternal allele the ICR is not methylated, and instead binds to CTCF. This coincides with H19 un-methylation, allowing H19 expression. The enhancer acts on H19 instead of Igf2 due to chromatin looping, therefore insulating Igf2 from the enhancers. In Wilm's tumor, loss of Igf2 imprinting (therefore loss of maternal imprinting) occurs, so both strands appear as the paternal strand and are hypermethylated. This leads to double the amount of Igf2 and no H19, causing extreme growth that contributes to cancer.</span></div>
