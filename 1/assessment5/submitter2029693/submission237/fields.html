    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, CpG islands tend to be unmethylated. In cancer cells, CpG
islands are more likely to be methylated. These methylated CpG islands may be
found in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes. Methylation at promoters
cause gene silencing. As a result, tumor suppressor genes get silenced.
This may allow cells to divide more rapidly. </p>

<p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. Cancer cells divide more rapidly
than normal cells. Therefore gene silencing via methylation is a very effective
mechanism for silencing tumor suppressor genes. Finally this contributes for
the tumour genesis.</p>

<p>Repetitive elements and intergenic regions are methylated in a normal cell.
Methylations at intergenic regions are important to </p>

<ul><li>maintain
     genomic stability </li><li>silence
     cryptic transcription start sites. </li></ul><p>Methylations
at repetitive elements are important for </p>

<ul><li>silencing
     of repeats to prevent transposition, </li><li>silencing
     of repeats to avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters
     and </li><li>maintain
     genomic integrity. </li></ul><p>Additionally
it prevents illegitimate recombinations between chromosomes. In order for recombination to occur chromatin must be in euchromatin form. Hypermethylation
condenses chromatin into heterochromatin form. Therefore recombinations are less
likely to occur. In cancer cells repetitive elements and intergenic regions
tend to become hypomethylated. So chromatin is in a more open euchromatin form.
Illegitimate recombinations can occur as they are not densely packaged into
heterochromatin.  Repeats can be activated because of the hypomethylation.
Therefore transposition can occur. Additionally cryptic promoters can get
activated. This can lead to transcriptional aberration in the neighboring
genes. As DNA get decondense due to hypomethylation, oncogenes can get
activated causing cells to divide rapidly. </p>

<p>Therefore hypomethylation and hypermathylation of DNA has different outcomes
based on region of the gene. Additionally methylations of different genes cause
different kinds of cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The
imprinted control region ICR is methylated in the paternal allele but
unmethylated in the maternal allele.  In the maternal allele,  an
insulator protein CTLF binds to the unmethylated ICR and insulates the Igf2
upstream, and the enhancers downstream enhance the RNA H19.  In the
paternal allele, the methylation of the ICR prevents the CTLF from binding and
insulating Igf2, leaving the Igf2 exposed as it were and prone to
"attack" (i.e., enhanced) by the downstream enhancers.  The Igf2
is thus enhanced and expressed only in the male allele.  Furthermore, in
the male allele, due to the downward spreading of DNA methylation from the ICR,
the encroaching methylation represses and silences the H19 promoter.  Igf2
is an oncogene that promotes growth.   Loss of imprinting is a hallmark of
cancer, and follows repeated insults over time on the DNA methylation.
 Because of loss of imprinting following expression of the paternal igf2
by enhancers, the maternal igf2 also is expressed resulting in a double dose of
growth-promoting igf2, as seen in the rare case of paternal disomy where the
cell inherits a double dose of the paternal allele.  This imprinting error
results in the childhood cancer called Wilm's tumor that affects the kidney.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Substrate for DNA methyltransferase(DNMT) is hemi methylated DNA. When there
are Decitabine incorporated into the DNA strand, DNMT is bound irreversibly to
the DNA. As a result DNMT can be no longer released and action of DNMT is inhibited.
Cancer cells divide more rapidly than normal cells. Decitabine is a nucleoside
analog. So it can be incorporated into DNA during replication and action of
DNMT can be inhibited.  Therefore cancer cells get more affected by
Decitabine than normal cells. Hypermethylation of promoter regions of tumor
suppressor genes have observed in cancer cells. Methylations at promoter
regions are leading to gene silencing. But DNA hypermethylation is reversible.
Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor and it can be used prevent
transferring methyl groups to promoter regions. So epigenetically silenced
tumor suppressor genes get activated and Decitabine can have an anti-tumour
effect. Decitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs have side-effects as well
as intended effects. Decisions have to be made as to the lesser <br />
of two evils; the harm done by the drugs vs. the harm done by the disease. The
severity of the disease, the patient's age, and the effectiveness of other
treatments all have to be considered. Treatments for cancer often are toxic to
normal cells as well as to cancer cells, but because cancer cells reproduce
rapidly chemotherapy will hit cancerous cells harder than other cells.<br /><br />
DNA methylation is altered in cancer cells. The changes are mitotically
heritable. Cancer cells proliferate, passing on these changes. Epigentic drugs
which target DNA methylation can also cause endurable heritable changes. 
For younger patients we especially have to think of enduring long-term effects,
and also that patients may be more strongly affected by the drugs if they are still
growing, still in a sensitive stage of development. We would especially worry
with young people about changes to germ cells..And there would be concern for
women of childbearing age, as a developing fetus would be very sensitive to the
biochemical environment. Periods of germ cell development and early embryonic
development are times when cells are most subject to reprogramming, </p>
