    <h1>Submission 291 from Anon (session_user_id: 0ce2f7974b0ce664d21174391ce41a73eaa573e4)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Their results by
Baylin and group showed that a combination of two epigenetic drugs - a
histone-deacetylase inhibitor and the DNA-demethylating agent azacitidine - slowed
tumour growth in some people with advanced lung cancer. But as important as
this observation was the fact that patients who did not show any apparent benefit
from the treatment itself did respond better to a chemotherapeutic session in
its wake. In Baylin´s words [the drugs] “<span>altered
the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more susceptible to
standard chemotherapy”. Since then it has been shown that DNA methylation can
have enduring effects on the epigenome because they are mitotically inherited,
i.e from parent cell to daughter cells, and this explains the long-lasting
effect of the drugs. Now, before any treatment is applied, it is important to
hold in mind that, in epigenetics, there are periods of development that are particularly
sensitive. These are the phases during which the epigenetic marks are being
erased to be rewritten next, i. e early phases of embryo development and the
formation of primordial germ cells and gametes. Patients treated during these
periods would not necessarily show any symptoms, but their progeny will. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-value"><p>Scientists
have known for ages that changes in the genome can influence the development
and progression of cancer. This MOOC taught us that the epigenetic
modifications in the DNA also play an important role in tumourigenesis and that
genetics and epigenetics are tightly interconnected, not least in the inception
of cancer. Scientists have identified different types of epigenetics modifications
associated to cancer genomes. For example, one of the hallmarks of cancer cells
is the alteration of their methylation state and their methylation patterns.
Their genome has been shown to be, on the whole, hypomethylated, but with the
presence of so-called hypermethylated CpG islands in specific regions. The
degree of hypo- versus hyper methylation as well as the specific pattern depends on the
type of cancer. Because these islands are often found in the regulating regions
of genes (promoter), they can eventually result in a different combination
of activation/ inhibition of tumour-promoting/ suppressing genes and end up in
cancer. Another type of epigenetic modification is found in the histone proteins
that coil the DNA, with changes in acetylation and methylation states that can,
again, end up in gain of silencing marks inhibiting gene expression or loss of
activation marks. DNA methylation patterns in <span>intergenic regions and repetitive elements are also
known to stabilise the DNA molecule and their removal (or hypomethylation) can
lead to genome instability, with an increased rate of mutations, DNA deletions,
permutations and chromosome recombinations. The erratic expression of non-coding
RNAs and the altered nuclear architecture are other hallmarks of cancers that
have an epigenetic component. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The parent-of-origin expression of Insulin-like
Growth Factor 2 and H19 is achieved with specific epigenetic marks during embryogenesis,
a process called imprinting. Igf-2 codes for an embryonic growth factor and is expressed
only from the paternal allele. It plays an important role during the
development of the placenta and the embryo. H19 is transcribed into a
non-coding RNA from the maternal allele and share an enhancer element with Igf2.
The methylation of an imprinted control region (ICR) and of the promoter of H19
determines the silencing of the latter gene and the expression of Igf2,
activated by the enhancer element. In the maternal chromosome, the ICR and the
promoter of H19 are free from methylation leading to 1) the expression of H19 as
a non-coding RNA and 2) the silencing of Igf2 by an ICR-dependent insulator
protein that prevents its activation by the enhancer elements. The loss of
imprinting of the Igf2 gene leads to increased concentrations of the protein in
the cell, overgrowth and loss of control from neighbouring cells, hallmarks of
cancer.  This has been identified in
several types of cancer known as embryonal tumours, among them a type of kidney
condition called Wilms tumour. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an epigenetic
drug used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, <span>a group of disorders caused
by poorly formed or dysfunctional blood cells, and that can derive in acute leukaemia. It belongs to the group of DNA Methyltransferase
inhibitors that act by reducing the degree of methylation of the genome (hypomethylating
agents). One of the hallmarks of cancer is precisely a hypermethylation of some
areas of the genome – the so-called CpG islands - and a genome-wide
hypomethylation. Different cancers have different hypo- and hypermethylation
patterns. The hypermethylation becomes particularly relevant because the CpG
islands are often found in the promoters, the sequences of the genome that
regulate gene expression. The hypermethylation of these sequences can then
result, in some cases, in the activation a tumour gene (normally silenced by
different genetic and epigenetic mechanisms) or the inhibition of a
tumour-suppressor gene (normally active). Thereby the important role of this
drug.</span></p></div>
