    <div class="field-value"><p>Generally in cancer there is a genome-wide loss of methylation but a noteworthy regionally specific gain of DNA methylation resulting in both genomic instability and silencing of genes involved in tumor suppression (<span>Review article: Hassler MR, Egger G. (2012). Epigenomics of cancer - emerging new concepts. Biochimie, 94(11):2219-30</span>).  At CpG islands normally, there are low levels of DNA methylation which allows underlying genes to be active.  In cancer however, it has been found that there is hypermethylation at CpG islands which causes silencing of the underlying gene (Egger G., Liang G., Aparicio A., Jones P.A. Epigenetics in human disease and prospects for epigenetic therapy. Nature. 2004;429:457–463. [PubMed: 15164071]).  This silencing can contribute to cancer if the gene that becomes silenced would otherwise play a role in functions such as conserving cellular identity and suppressing tumors.  DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements may be disrupted in cancer by being unmethylated, putting genomic stability at risk.  This disruption may effect promoters and enhancers which, when dysregulated, may contribute to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The methylation pattern of the Igf2 cluster on the paternal allele is unmethylated, so as to allow for an active gene which determines Igf2 expression status.  The maternal allele is methylated and thus silent, i.e. not expressed.  In Wilms' tumor, there is typically loss of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster so that Igf2 is overexpressed.  Disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster may contribute to cancer for the reason of “alterations of the DNA modification machinery drive erroneousus setting of methylation marks in imprinting regions throughout the genome” (Hubertus J., Lacher M., Rottenkolber M., Muller-Hocker J., Berger M., Stehr M., von Schweinitz D., Kappler R. Altered expression of imprinted genes in Wilms tumors. Oncol. Rep. 2011;25:817-823.).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug belonging to the class of DNA demethylating agents, also known as hypomethylating agents.  In other words, the effect of Decitabine is to inhibit DNA methylation.  When used in conjunction with a follow up treatment of more standard chemotherapeutic drugs, Decitabine may have an anti-tumor effect by altering tumor cells epigenetically which in turn changes the cells into being more “susceptible to standard chemotherapy” (Magazine article: (2012, 7th April). Cancer's epicentre. The Economist.).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In describing how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome, the article in question states that “epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased” (Magazine article: (2012, 7th April). Cancer's epicentre. The Economist.).  In other words, epigenetic alterations can have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment.  It would be inadvisable to treat patients with such drugs during sensitive periods, when DNA is highly demethylated, which occurs in the blastocyst stage of early development and also during primordial germ cell development.  Treatment during these times would be inadvisable because the epigenome undergoes change during these times and any disruption would likely have an impact on successful epigenetic reprogramming which occurs by the DNA re-methylating again, bringing the sensitive periods to a close.</p></div>
