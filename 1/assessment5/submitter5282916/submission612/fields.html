    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value">DNA should, for the most part, should not be methylated at CpG islands. However, in cancer the CpG islands are often hypermethylated. This hypermethylation can silence genes that code for growth inhibiting factors that suppress cancer growth. Intergenic regions and repetative elements are normally methylated, but in instances of cancer these regions are hypomethylated. This allows for genomic instability and the expression of oncogenes, which cause cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is classified as a DNA-demethylating agent which means is works to demethylate and open up DNA to transcription factors. This allows the expression of cancer suppressor genes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can have a lasting effect on the epigenome if the epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable. This means that when the cell divides, its daughter cells will have inherited the same epigenetic marks. A sensitive period is when the epigenome is being reprogrammed and, therefore, is more apt to be altered due to environmental factors. Sensitive periods of development are when the primordial germ cells are forming and during preimplantation development. Treating patients during sensitive periods would not be advised because it is at a time when the epigenome is already unstable. Also, changes during this time may be erased, reprogrammed, or unable to pass on to daughter cells in mitosis.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Igf2 expression is mostly from the paternal chromosome and it is usually has transcriptional methylation of the maternal Igf2 promoters.The paternal H19 promoter is often methylated and silenced. In the Wilm's tumor, there is a loss of imprinting of the Igf2 gene. It is caused by hypomethylation of the normally suppressed maternal allele. H19, the tumor suppressor gene, is hypermethylated while Igf2, an oncogene, is hypomethylated. This allows a tumor to grow without regulation.</div>
