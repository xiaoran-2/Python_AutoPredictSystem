    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is altered in cancer by both hypermethylation
of specific CpG islands and hypomethylation globally across the genome. CpG
islands occur in gene promoters. In a normal cell, they are not typically
methylated, but they can become methylated to induce gene silencing. In cancer
cells, they are frequently hypermethylated. While the specific promoters that
are hypermethylated vary by cancer type, they tend to be located on tumor
suppressors genes. Thus their modification silences tumor suppressor
expression, promoting tumor growth. In contrast to CpG islands, intergenic
regions and repetitive elements are typically methylated in a non-cancerous
cell genome. These modifications reduce their accessibility to transcription
factors, helping to maintain genomic integrity and preventing expression of cryptic
genes. In cancer these regions are globally hypomethylated, resulting in
illegitimate recombination events, repeat transposition events and the
activation of cryptic genes. This genetic instability leads to additional mutation
events and selective pressure propagates those mutations which promote cancer cell
growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altered levels of imprint control region methylation, resulting in a loss of imprinting information, are frequently observed in cancer. This commonality is probably because many imprinted genes are involved in cell growth. For example, in the H19/Igf2 cluster the paternal allele is methylated at the ICR and the H19 promotor, allowing downstream enhancers to activate Igf2. In contrast the maternal allele is not methylated, permitting the binding of an insulator protein, CTCF, which blocks these enhancers from accessing Igf2. Additionally the lack of methylation on H19 in the maternal allele allows these enhancers to promote H19 expression. In normal cells, these effect combine to silence Igf2 expression from the maternal allele. However, in Wilm’s tumor abnormal methylation of the H19/Igf2 cluster occurs at the maternal allele. This abnormality results in the maternal chromosome expressing Igf2 as though it were paternal, leading to a double dose of Igf2 which promotes growth of the cancerous cells. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a cancer therapy drug that aims to reverse cancerous changes to the epigenome. It belongs to the DNA methyl transferase (DNMT) inhibitor class. It is thought to be incorporated into the DNA as a nucleoside analogue and then irreversibly bind DNMT. This association prevents DNMT from methylating daughter strands, resulting in a replication dependent clearing of epigenetic marks. While the precise mechanism of action remains unclear, this clearing has a potentially anti-tumor effect by reactivating tumor suppressor genes that had been silenced due to hypermethylation. Decitabine has been shown to be effective in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation have a lasting effect on
the epigenetic state because these changes are mitotically inheritable. This
means that the daughter cells will have the same DNA methylation state as their
parent cell. An epigenetically sensitive period refers to times when epigenetic
marks are cleared and subsequently reprogramed between generations. These primarily
occur during primordial germ cell development and during the pre-implantation /
early post-implantation periods. During these times changes to the environment
can affect the laying down of epigenetic marks which will then be mitotically inheritable
for life. As such treatment by drugs with epigenetic targets would be
inadvisable during this time as it would have much greater potential for permeant,
serious side effects.</p></div>
