    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell, DNA shows hypomethylation in the CpGs islands and on it's shores, also we can see that the intergenic region and the repetitive elements are methylated. In cancer cells, we have a hypermetylation on the CpGs and hypomethylation in the intergenic region and in the repetitive elements; that is a bad thing for the cell because hypomethylation in the repetitive elements will cause then to "jump" around the genome and probably interfere with some other genes while intergenic hypomethylation will cause genomic instability, in both cases, the abnormalities that arise with this aberrant methylation will start to accumulate thing like transcriptional interference, deletions, illegitimate translocations and it will increase the probability of an neoplastic tissue growth; in the case of CpG hypermethylation, we can have a silencing of tumour surpressor genes and then we would have an abnormal growth of cells that can lead to a cancer.<br /><ul><li>Acknowledgment: Epigenetic control of gene expression module seven - Cancer epigenetics by Dr. Marnie Blewitt (seen in 08/16/15).<br /></li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the case of H19/lgf2, in a normal cell we can have or not methylation in the ICR (imprinting control region) which binds to CTFC; on the paternal allele we have mathylation on the ICR and thus CTCF cannot bind on it and in the maternal allele, we have no methylation and the CTCF can bind to it. The CTCF is an insulator that can block the interaction between the enhancers and the promoters of a cluster; when we have methylation like in the paternal allele, CTCF cannot bind and the enhancer can promote lgf2; on the maternal allele, with no methylation, CTCF binds and the enhancers cannot act on the lgf2 and it can't be expressed. In Wilm's tumor we have a maternal allele with methylation on the ICR just like the paternal allele and it causes and upregulation of lgf2, which is a oncogene and it's abnormal expression due to disrupting imprinting can lead to an abnormal growth of cells which can lead to a tumor like Wilm's tumor.<br /><ul><li>Acknowledgment: Epigenetic control of gene expression module four - Genomic imprinting and epigenetic reprogramming by Dr. Marnie Blewitt (seen in 07/26/15).<br /></li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the DNA methytransferase inhibitors class, which as the name suggests, it stops the maintenance of the methyl groups on the DNA by stopping the action of the DNMT enzyme and thus we have no copies of the methylation of the mother cells in her daughter cells. Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect because it can act upon tumour surpressor genes with heavy methylated regions and it can bring those genes to an activate state again. Decitabine has been used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes.<br /><ul><li>Acknowledgments: Epigenetic control of gene expression module seven - Cancer epigenetics by Dr. Marnie Blewitt (seen in 08/16/15).<br /></li><li>Magazine article: (2012, 7th April).

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that affect the epigenome can have enduring effects because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, in another words, it is passed from the mother cell to her two daughter cells during division and thus perpetuating the changes caused by the drugs. The epigenome is more sensitive to changes in it's structure on the sensitive periods, a time of intense epigenetic reprogramming (when the epigenetic marks are lied down, replaced, etc); it happens mainly in two periods of development, in the early development and in the primordial germ cell development. Treatment with epigenetic drugs on this sensitive periods would not be a good choice because this is a critic period of development and even small changes can have a large array of consequences like loss of imprinting, hypomethylation of transposon and other epigenetic mistakes. <br /><ul><li>Acknowledgments: Epigenetic control of gene expression module seven - Cancer epigenetics by Dr. Marnie Blewitt (seen in 08/16/15).<br /></li><li>Review article: Hassler MR, Egger G.
