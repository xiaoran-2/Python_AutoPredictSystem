    <div class="field-value">The hallmarks of cancer have been to altered methylation patterns.  Normally, at CpG islands, which are clustered at the promoters of genes, are unmethylated to prevent gene silencing.  However in cancer, these CpG islands are hypermethylated and silence certain genes that are tumor suppressors.  The most notable of theses silenced genes are<i> RB</i> in retinoblastoma,<i> MLH1</i> in colorectal cancer,<i> BRCA1</i> in breast cancer, and <i>MGMT</i> in gliomas and colorectal cancer.  Intergenic regions and repetitive elements, however, are methylated in healthy cells.  The role of intergenic regions and repetitive elements is not fully understood but current research attributes them as "junk" DNA.  A loss of methylation or hypomethylation leads to genomic instability of CpG poor promoters and can result in the activation of certain genes like <em>R-RAS</em> in gastric cancer.  Hypomethylation is most likely due to the deletion of Dnmt1, this is the mechanism by which DNA methylation patterns are laid down.  Traditionally, the hypermethylation of CpG islands and the hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements has been of signet of cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In healthy cells, differentially methylated regions are regulatory sites ensuring parent-of-origin specific imprinted genes and this occurs in primordial germ cells and in early development, and in cancer cells, dysregulation of imprinted genes results in biallelic or loss of expression in imprinted genes.  With regards to the <i>H19/IGF2</i> cluster, which act as enhancer blocking, in normal imprinting, the <i>IGF2</i> genes is traditionally from the paternal allele while <i>H19</i> is transcribed from the maternal allele.  Further, imprinted expression in both genes is regulated by an imprinting center in which the maternal allele is unmethylated and the paternal allele is methylated and the imprinted center (or ICR) should only bind to the unmethylated region of the CTCF of the maternal allele.  Binding of CTCF blocks the activity of the enhancer element located downstream of<i> H19</i> and restricts activity to<i> H19</i> expression.  Melthylation of the CTCF binding sites prevents the binding of CTCF and allows the enhancer to activate <i>IGF2</i>, which causes biallelic expression of the CTCF and results in cancer.  In Wilm's tumor, the <i>H19</i> gene is methylated and <i>IGF2</i> is methylated causing a loss of imprinting/expression which causes increased cell growth.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to a treatment class of DNA-demethylating agents and is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes which are the precursors of acute myelogenous leukemia.  This drug most likely targets tumors and cancers that are a result of CpG island hypermethylation of genes like <i>BRAC1</i> that leads to breast cancer and DNMT's.  By acting as a demethylating agent, the CpG islands regions have a chance to be restored to there normal unmethylated state, where genes are meant to be expressed and not silenced.  Since numerous genes located at CpG islands are tumor suppressors, Decitabine should have anti-tumor effects by either restoring the genes to there normal state or may even increase levels of expression in the genes and increase their effectiveness in anti-tumor development.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Our environment effects our epigenetics and the use of treatments like Decitabine because it alters DNMTi's in hopes that certain tumor suppressing genes are activated and functioning properly.  Many chemicals and even foods can alter methylation patterns, for example, folate and BPA.  Folate when given to mice during gestation increased methylation while BPA (known toxic) reduced methylation patterns .  However, it is not always advisable to treat patients with such drugs and these periods are known as sensitive periods.  Sensitive periods are periods of pre-implantation development, germ cell development, embryogenesis/gametogenesis (usually due to diet, where epigenetic marks are being laid down), and periods of epigenetic reprogramming are considered sensitive, i.e., cloning, IVF/ICSI, and ART.  Patients wanting to have children or are pregnant need to be advised about the potential repercussions since epigenetic markings/changes are mitotically heritable and their children may inherit defects/disorders.  For example, mice treated with the fungicide vinclzolin had offspring with sub-fertility and fewer sperm.  In people, the Dutch Famine cohort and Overkalix gave evidence of how important diet was during gestation and evidence of trangenerational inheritance because many of the children and grandchildren experienced increased incidence in cardiovascular disease and diabetes.  </div>
