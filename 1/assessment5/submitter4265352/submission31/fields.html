    <div class="field-value">In normal cells the CpG islands are lightly methylated, but in cancerous cells they tend to become hyper-methylated. CpG islands contain gene promoters and this hypermethylation acts to silence those genes. This contributes to cancer when the genes that are silenced are genes such as tumour suppressors, growth inhibitors or metastasis suppressors, which then no longer function to help control and eradicate damaged cells. <br /><br />The converse is true in the intergenic regions and repetitive elements. In normal cells these tend to be heavily methylated to preserve genomic stability e.g. by silencing the promoters on transposons, thus preventing them from replicating and moving. In cancerous cells these areas become hypo-methylated. This allows elements such as Intracisternal A-particles (IAPs) to move around and insert themselves into genes, as seen in the Axon gene where an IAP has inserted itself into the gene in some strains of mice and, if not silenced, leads to defects in the tail and spine. <br /><br />Because repetitive elements in cancerous cells are not silenced they are not compressed into bundles of heterochromatin, but instead are found in euchromatin and are therefore far more accessible. This allows them to recombine illicitly, allowing reciprocal translocations on mismatched genes, insertions and deletions.<br /><br />In addition if areas of structural heterochromatin, such as is found at the centromeres, are hypo-methylated and instead form euchromatin, then this can affect cell division, allowing errors such as differences in ploidy.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the paternal allele the Imprint Control Region (ICR) is methylated, preventing the CTCF protein from binding to it, and this methylation spreads to the H19 gene promoter, silencing it. This causes the downstream enhancers to act on the Igf2 gene instead.<br /><br />In the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated allowing the CTCF protein to bind to it. This physically prevents the downstream enhancers from accessing the Igf2 gene and they act on the H19 gene instead.<br /><br />The combination of a paternal allele that produces Igf2, which is a growth promoter, and a maternal allele that produces H19, which acts to limit body weight and cell proliferation, gives the cell a balanced dosage.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumour the maternal allele becomes methylated, essentially becoming a second copy of the paternal allele. This means that not only does the cell produce a double dose of Igf2, but there is no H19 production.<br /><br />The combination of a double dose of a growth promoter, combined with no expression of a cell proliferation inhibitor, gives the ideal conditions for the uncontrolled growth and cell replication that is a hallmark of cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. <br /><br />Decitabine acts to prevent DNA methylation by permanently binding to DNA methyltranferase and rendering it inactive. This reduces the level of DNA methylation in the cell as it will decrease passively, as upon initial cell division only one strand of the DNA will be methylated, and on subsequent divisions this dilution of methylation levels will repeat so that the methylation levels will reduce passively.<br /><br />If the tumour is driven by silencing tumour suppressor or metastasis supressor genes then Decitabine can act to reduce the methylation of these genes, to an extent reactivating them and allowing them to function and control the spread or growth of the cancer.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable therefore any changes made to the methylation levels will persist in the cells until cell death or until some other factor acts to change them, so any changes the drug makes to methylation levels will continue, even after the drug treatment has finished.<br /><br />A sensitive period is one during which the cell is undergoing epigenetic reprogramming. The sensitive periods for the organism as a whole are the period from gamete formation through to implantation, and also the period of primordial germ cell development. However it should be remembered that particular organs may have additional sensitive periods, as is shown by the effect of licking in mice on the development of the hippocampus.<br /><br />Current medicines that target the epigenetic machinery are not specific, i.e. they do not only target cells in the cancerous growths, they target all cells in the organism. To introduce anything that disrupts the epigenetic machinery at a time when large scale epigenetic reprogramming is occurring could make damaging, possibly fatal, changes to the epigenome which is vulnerable during these periods of widespread change and it would therefore be inadvisable to treat a patient with these drugs during these periods.<br /></div>
