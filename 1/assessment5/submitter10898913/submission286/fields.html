    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cells the CpG islands are generally not methylated but in cancer, methylation occurs at the CpG islands of tumour suppressor genes leading to uncontrolled cancer growth. Moreover the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated in normal condition but undergo demethylation during cancer. This can lead to the activation of different non-coding RNAs which may be antisense to various tumour suppressor genes. Cis acting long non-coding RNAs are also found to recruit other epigenetic modifiers and result in gene silencing. Altered methylation pattern can also activate different imprinted genes promoting cancer growth. In summary, hypermethylation at the CpG island of tumour supprssor genes and global hypomethylation act as hallmarks of cancer progression. As epigenetic modifications are mitotically inherited it can be transmitted to progenitor cells leading to rapid tumour growth.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In paternal allele the imprinting control region (ICR) is methylated as a result of which the insulator CTCF can not bind to it. This makes enhancer capable of inducing Igf2 expression from paternal allele. But in maternal allele the ICR region is not methylated and insulator protein CTCF binds to it. CTCF then prevent enhancer to activate Igf2. Thus Igf2 is expressed only from paternal allele in normal cells. But in case of Wilm's tumour, ICR of maternal allele also gets methylated resulting in activation of Igf2 gene by downstream enhancers. Thus in this condition Igf2 gets expressed from both the alleles. Overexpression of Igf2 leads to overexpression of growth promoters which ultimately helps in tumour growth..</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA methylation inhibitors (or acts as DNA demethylating agent). In cancer several epigenetic modifiers hypermethylates different growth restricting genes or tumour suppressor genes leading to uncontrolled tumour growth. Decitabine can prevent DNA hypermethylation by inhibiting DNA methyltransferases and thus can prevent tumour growth.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is one of the controlling factors of gene expression. Any changes in the epigeneome like hypo or hypermethylation of DNA can activate or repress genes respectively. There are some periods during development that are more prone to epigenetic changes called as sensitive period. There are two different sensitive periods during development-(a) early developmental periods (pre and early post-implantation period) and (b) period of primordial germ cell development. Treating patients with epigenetic drugs during these periods are not advisable because these are the periods of active DNA demethylation and other epigenetic changes. Any unnecessary changes can have adverse developmental or health effects.</div>
