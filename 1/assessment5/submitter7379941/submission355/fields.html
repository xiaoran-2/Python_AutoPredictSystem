    <div class="field-value"><div>

<p>DNA
methylation is a simple addition of a single methyl group to cytosine at
position 5 (C5). The modification of the C5 position of the cytosine base (5
mC) is found in approximately 80% of CpG dinucleotides in somatic mammalian
cells.</p>

<p>Generally,
DNA methylation of promoter regions inversely correlates with gene expression.
Exceptions are CpG islands, which are found in about 60% of promoters. They
have a high CpG density and are usually kept free of methylation independent of
their activity state. CpG methylation is a silencing epigenetic mark and may
have developed as a defense against expression of parasitic DNA elements. CpG methylation
is essential for life. In mammals, DNA methylation is required for proper
embryogenesis and development, for sustaining chromosomal stability, telomere
length, and predetermined gene expression states.</p>

<p>However,
in cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then
causes silencing of the underlying gene. Silencing of tumor suppressor genes
can lead to formation of cancer. </p>

</div>

<p>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements
maintains genomic stability through silence cryptic transcription start sites
or cryptic splice sites, and silencing of repeats to prevent
transposition/avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters.</p>

<p>In cancer, genomewide hypomethylation (lack of methylation) at
intergenic regions and repetitive elements is found more consistently than
mutation. This hypomethylation will cause genomic instability and this will
contribute to cancer<span>.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation of imprint control regions (ICRs) has
different effects depending on the mode of action of the ICR which control
parent-of-origin expression at the imprinted cluster.</p>

<p>Insulator model of imprinting is a mechanism utilized
to mediating imprinting in clusters, which is employed by the H19/Igf2
imprinted locus. </p>

<p>On the paternal chromosome, methylation at the ICR
not only prevents insulator protein CTCF from binding, allowing Igf2 to engage
the enhancers (increase Igf2 expression), but it is also required for
methylation and silencing of H19. However, on maternal allele these
interactions were not detectable when a methylated H19 ICR that does not bind
CTCF (decrease Igf2 expression).</p>

<span>In Wilm’s tumor, imprinting at H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted. On
paternal allele, CTCF blocks the enhancers from accessing the Igf2 promoter and
they instead promote H19 expression. DNA methylation at ICR blocks binding of
CTCF. Without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to silence H19. In addition,
enhancers will increase Igf2 expression. On maternal allele, Cdkn1c (tumor
suppressor gene) expression will be lost. Disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2
cluster contributes to cancer as it will increase oncogenic activity (Igf2
upregulation) &amp; decrease tumor suppression activity (Cdkn1c repression).</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine),
a DNMT inhibitor, is a potent hypomethylating cytidine analogue (i.e. DNA-demethylating
agents). Decitabine induces general and selective demethylation (hypomethylation)
by binding to DNMTs, irreversibly, after being incorporated into DNA. </p><p>Decitabine inhibition of DNMTs is replication dependant. At low doses, Decitabine
can have an anti-tumour effect (<span>DNA-demethylation of hypermetylated tumor suppressor genes) and
this was shown when Decitabine used to treat patients with myelodysplastic
syndromes (MDS). MDS patients treated with Decitabine had a longer survival,
improve quality of life, and no severe side effects from Decitabine usage.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes like DNA methylation, unlike other
forms of gene regulation, are passed on during cell division (mitotically heritable)
to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Sensitive
period in epigenetics is the period of development that is
susceptible to environmental signals such as the period of pre-implantation development
and germ cell development. </p>

<p>Treating
patients during <span>Sensitive periods (i.e.
during embryogenesis/gametogenesis) would be inadvisable as they are the
periods when epigenetic marks are established rather than maintained. This can
alter the availability of methyl donors, introduce endocrine factors that
influence epigenetic state, and influence the establishment of epigenetic marks.</span></p></div>
