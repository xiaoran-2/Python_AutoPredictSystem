    <div class="field-value"><p>  There are two main disruptions linked to DNA
methylation in cancer: CpG island hypermethylation and genome-wide
hypomethylation. In mammalian genomes, a
high percentage of CpG
islands is located in gene promoters.
Therefore, DNA methylation at CpG islands is associated to gene
silencing. In normal cells, most CpG islands are unmethylated; on the
other hand, the DNA of tumour
cells tends to be methylated at those
sites, as well as at its neighbouring
regions. Moreover, the hypermethylation
occurs specially in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes. This
results in the inactivation of genes that would prevent cancer,
making tumours more likely to develop.
Another difference in between normal and
tumour cells is the methylation pattern at intergenic regions and
repetitive elements throughout the genome,
which are usually methylated.
Methylation
is related to genome integrity and
stability and, depending on the site, might
play a role in preventing the
transcription of undesired sequences or
intragenic promoters, up-
or downregulating
context-specific alternative promoters, as well as modulating
alternative splicing. In
cancer, hypomethylation of the
previously
mentioned regions commonly
lead to genomic instability. After
being transcribed, repeats might align and have abnormal
recombination, because their large repetitive sequences can be
similar to other repeats or to euchromatic regions of the genome. If
transposition occurs, repeats might disrupt a coding sequence or
activate cryptic promoters, such as in the Avy
allele. Additionaly, hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters
might lead to the activation of oncogenes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">  Disruption of imprinting is a common feature in cancer cells. The hypo- or hypermethylation of imprint control regions (ICRs) lead to silencing or expression of genes from both parental alleles. The reason why disruption of imprinting contributes to cancer is that many of the imprinted genes are related to growth; the activation of growth promoting or the silencing of growth suppressing genes might occur. The paternally imprinted H19/Igf2 cluster can be taken as an example. Normally, its ICR is unmethylated on the maternal allele and methylated on the paternal allele. When the ICR is unmethylated, it is a binding site for the insulator protein CTCF, which insulates Igf2 from enhancers, making the enhancers act on the lncRNA H19 that is transcribed. However, in the paternal allele, the ICR and the H19 promoter are methylated, so CTCF is not able to bind, and the expression of Igf2 is enhanced instead of H19. Therefore, Igf2 is expressed from the paternal allele. In Wilm's tumour the ICR is hypermethylated in both alleles and Igf2 is overexpressed. Since Igf2 promotes growth, a double dose can be involved in cell proliferation and, consequently, tumorigenesis.

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">  Decitabine is a demethylating agent – it is a cytosine analog that incorporates into DNA strands when they are replicated and thus inhibits DNA methylation by DNA methyltransferases. Since DNA methylation is a mitotically heritable but reversible mark, agents that affect methylation can be used to change the epigenetic state of replicating-cells. Decitabine is useful against the CpG island hypermethylation found in several tumours, particularly in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes. Therefore, genes that should not be silenced, such as tumour suppressor genes, may be reactivated, and remain expressed as long as DNA hypermethylation is prevented in the new cells. Since tumour cells replicate at a higher rate than normal ones, they are the cells that are most affected by the drug.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">         
Methylation patterns are preserved during cell replication. Consequently, by taking a drug that alters DNA methylation only once, the laying down of methyl groups by DNA methyltransferases in the new cells will be affected. It is really important to consider the sensitive periods of epigenetic control before starting a treatment. There are special stages of epigenome reprogramming, in which the environment may have a stronger influence in the epigenetic machinery: from germ cell development to maturation of the gametes and from pre-implantation to early post-implantation period. Each organ has a sensitive period as well. According to that, taking a drug that inhibits the epigenetic machinery during these periods could have undesired consequences and disrupt the proper development of an individual's cells (germ cells, for instance) and organs. In conclusion, epigenetic therapy should not be advised specially to pregnant women and young people.
