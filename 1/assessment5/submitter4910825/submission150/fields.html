    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at CpG islands is responsible for the tissue-specific silencing of genes that results in differentiation.  <br /><br />In cancer, CpG islands are hypermethylated in a tumour-specific manner.  This results in silencing of tumour suppressors, allowing tumour growth to proceed unchecked. <br /><br />Intergenic regions and repetitive elements in normal cells are methylated.  As a result, repetitive regions such as transposable elements are silenced, preventing disruption of coding regions.  <br /><br />When these regions are hypomethylated, as in some cancers, transposable elements may relocate, leading to genomic instability. In addition, strong promoters of genes that are normally silenced may be activated .</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Insulator-mediated imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster regulates the transcription of Igf2 and H19. <br /><br />When the insulator protein, CTFC, binds to the imprint control region (ICR) on the unmethylated maternal ICR,  Igf2 is insulated from the downstream enhancers. When blocked, these enhancers activate their secondary target H19, also unmethylated, instead of Igf2 which is silenced. The expression of H19 results in a long non-coding RNA which serves as a reservoir for RNAi. <br /><br />The ICR on the paternal chromosome is methylated, preventing the binding of CTFC.  Methylation of the ICR spreads to H19, silencing its expression.  Enhancers are not blocked and activate their preferential target, Igf2 which is then transcribed and translated.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumour, the loss of the maternal allele and duplication of the paternal allele results in complete silencing ot H19 and over expression of Igf2.  <br /><br />The disruption of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster seen in Wilm's tumour contributes to cancer because a tumour suppressor is silenced and an ocogene is activated.  H19 acts as a tumour suppressor that regulates the expression of Igf2, an ocogene, the result is an increase in the amount of the protein product of Igf2 and subsequent uncontrolled cell cycling.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a demethylating agent.  A cytadine analog, it replaces the normal base, a target of methylation by the methyl transferase enzyme.  As a result, maintenance of methylation does not occur following replication and demethylation occurs passively..<br /><br />Hypermethylation of tumour suppressors is characteristic of some tumours. Inhibiting the enzymes responsible for maintenance of this hypermethylation could activate tumour suppressor expression, resulting in ihibition of tumour growth.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Because epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable, they are passed to daughter cells as the tumour grows, thereby permanently altering the epigenome of a cell line.<br /><br />Sensitive periods are times in development when epigenetic marks are cleared and re-set.  In the embryo, these include pre-implantation, when epigenetic marks are re-established in a tissue specific manner and mid-gestation when primordial germ cells are developing.  Another sensitive period is during the time that germ cells are maturing: 8-10 yrs in females and 10-12 in males.<br /><br />Using drugs that disrupt the establishment of these marks (lineage-specific and imprinting) during these sensitive periods would result in epigenetic alterations, many (if not all) of which would be deleterious.</div>
