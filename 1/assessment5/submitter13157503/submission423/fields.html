    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, CpG islands, which
are regions with high density of CpG and are found at promoter of genes, are
usually protected from methylation. In tumor cells, CpG islands are
hypermethylated compared to normal cells. This hypermethylation would silence
the corresponding genes including the so called tumor suppressor genes whose
function is crucial for genome stability.Tumor suppressor genes include those
involved in apoptosis and DNA repair system such as TP53 or those which are
part of SWI/SNF complex and are involved in nucleosome repositioning using ATP
(e.g. SMARCA4 and SMARCB1). Inactivation of these genes by any means including
promoter methylation can lead to cancer development and progression. <br /></p>

<p>In contrast to CpG islands, DNA
methylation is  observed at repetitive elements and intergenic regions
in normal cells. In order to keep these regions silenced, normal cells keep
these regions methylated and compact (by formation of heterochromatin). Losing
methylation at these regions can lead to genomic instability. The latter can happen
due to different events such as illegitimate recombination between repeated
sequences, activation of repetitive elements and activation of cryptic
promoters that are usually silenced and can run into neighboring genes and
disrupt them. all these event can lead to genomic instability and eventually
tumor development and progression.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>in normal cells, the Igf2 gene is
expressed only from paternal allele and H19 is only expressed from maternal
allele. The two loci share enhancers and their normal regulation is mediated by
a CTCF-dependent insulator. In paternal allele H19 is not expressed due to the
methylation and heterochromatine formation that spreads through the CTCF and
promoter region. However; silencing of the Igf2 on the maternal allele is due
to the CTCF protein binding to the ICR and cuting the access of Igf2 to
enhancers. So, only H19 has access to enhancer and can be expressed from
maternal allele. In Wilm's tumor, in contrast, the CTCF region on the maternal
allele is methylated and H19 is silenced, and Igf2, which is an oncogene, is
expressed. So overexpress of this oncogene (Igf2) would lead to development of
tumor.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is one of the first FDA approved drugs that target epigenetic machinary. It belongs to the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. DNMTi is a group of epigenetic drugs that inhibit DNMTs from methylating DNA molecule. As discussed earlier  methylation at CpG islands of tumor supressor genes can lead to development of cancer.<br />The drug is used for treating myelodysplastic syndromes which are precursors of AML or acute myelogenous leukaemia. <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">epigenetics marks are those that can be passed on to daughter cells and will remain on the genome till they be actively removed. so epigenetic drugs can have effects on tumor cells lasting beyond the period of treatment. This drugs affect all dividing cells and not only tumor cell. so it may not be advisable at sensitive period regarding epigentic reprogramming (when epigenetic marks are removing and laying down). These period span from development of primordial germ cells to the production of mature germ cells (sperm and eggs) and also from pre-implementation to early post-implementation. So, for example, if a young patient that still developing germ cells or a pregnant woman at an early post-implementation stage be treated by epigentic drugs, it would affect not only tumor cells (which are the right target) but also germ cells or embryonic cells and the adverse effect would be passed on to daughter cells.<br /><br /></div>
