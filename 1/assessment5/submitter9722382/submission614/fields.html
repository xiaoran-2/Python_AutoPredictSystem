    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the H19/lgf2 cluster the normal expression for H19/lgf2 will differ from the maternal to the paternal allele.  For example, in the paternal allele of a normal cell, the H19 promoter is methylated and so it is silenced.  However, the Imprint Control Region is also silenced, allowing Enhancers to access and activate lgf2.  In the maternal allele, the H19 promoter is not methylated and so is accessed and activated by the enhancers.  The Imprint Control Region for the maternal allele is blocked by the binding of a CTCF insulator protein which prevents access to and activation of lgf2.  In this case, only a single dose would be produced (due to the paternal allele).  If the maternal allele has a methylated H19 promoter and then the ICR becomes blocked, as the CTCF binding protein is blocked and enhancers can access lgf2, producing a double dose of lgf2 that is associated with Wilm's tumour.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation may affect cancer in different ways.  For genome wide hypomethylation, undesirable elements such as repeats may be allowed to activate where they would have been silenced by methylation.  Conversely, hypermethylation of specific genes may help promote cancer if the genes or regions are normally involved in roles for tumor silencing or normal activity.   If normal CPG islands are unmethylated and they are associated with a gene that may control or suppress cancer cells, then methylation of the islands would lead to inactivation of the associated cancer suppressing gene. For intergenic regions and repetitive elements, hypermethylation is the norm, as the silencing of these regions is needed to maintain genomic integrity and stability.  The methylation of the intergenic regions will also help to silence cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites that may alter the correct transcription of the original sequence.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor that functions by hypomethylating the region of interest.  For a tumor suppressing gene, methylation of a tumor suppressing gene would be associated with cancer as the gene would be silenced, thus enabling the cancer to grow during cell division.  By demthylating the affected gene, the tumor suppressor would be able to act upon the cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
