    <div class="field-value">In mammals methylation takes place almost exclusively at CpG dinucleotides. DNA methyltransferase (DNMT3 a and DNMT3b) lay down methylation. DNA methylation is maintained by DNMT1 which methylates heme-methylated DNA. CpG islands are clusters of CpGs. CpG islands are often at promoters of genes. CpG islands tend to be protected by methylation. When they are methylated this part of the DNA is silenced.<br /><br />In cancer as normal tissue progresses to hyperplasia, neoplasia and invasion methylation in certain CpG islands increases. Hypermethylated CpG islands tend to be around tutor suppressor genes. DNA methylation is mitotically heritable so hypermethylation of CpG islands is a very effective way of silencing tutor suppressor genes. When that happens in many CpG islands can lead to oncogenesis. <br /><br />Methylation at intergenic regions takes place to maintain genomic integrity and silencing of cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites. DNMT1 null cells display genomic instability (insertions, reciprocal translocations, deletions). Methylation at repetitive elements takes place to also maintain genomic stability. This is achieved by silencing of repeats to prevent transposition,  mutation of repeats to prevent transposition and silencing of repeats to avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters. Methylation of repeats may also prevent illegitimate recombination. Due to methylation’s mutagenic effect Prof. Timothy Bestor proposed the Genome defines model based on which methylation exists to protect the genome from transposable elements.<br /><br />While in normal cells introns, internecine regions and receptive elements tend to be methylated, in cancer cells they are unmethylated. As a result of hypomethylation of repeats there is illegitimate recombination between repeats (such as reciprocal translocations), activation of repeats and transposition and activation of cryptic promotes and disruption to neighbouring genes; all of which result in genomic instability.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The imprinted control region (ICR) is unmethylated on the maternal allele. A long non-coding RNA called H19 exists on the maternal allele only. A protein called CTCF (an insulating protein) binds on the unmethylated control region. CTCF insulates Igf2 from the downstream enhancers which as a result act on H19.<br /><br />The imprinted control region is methylated on the paternal allele -&gt;paternally imprinted. Because the ICR is methylated the CTCF protein cannot bind on it. As a result the enhancers act on Igf2 which is expressed. The methylation in the ICR is spread to the H19 which as a result is silenced. <br /><br />While normal cells express mono-allelic origin of parent allele, cancer cells show loss of imprinting: they are either expressed from both parental alleles or silenced from both parental alleles.  The reason this is happening in cancer is because a lot of imprinted genes are involved in growth: either promoting growth or inhibiting growth. Both hyper or hypomethylation of ICR is observed in cancer depending on the ICR.<br /><br />In Wilm’s tumour(WT) there is hypermethylation of the maternal allele causing expression of Igf2 from the maternal allele as well as the paternal. As Igf2 is growth promoting it leads to WT.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"> Decitabine is a dna methyltransferase inhibitor. It is a nucleoside analogues, incorporated into DNA upon replication. When the DNMT comes along to bind to the nucleotide (to copy the methylation), the DNMT is bind irreversible and can no longer be released. Decitabine’s action is devision dependent. As cancer cells are more serenely replicating than normal cells will be affected more. It may also have an anti-tumour effect by inhibiting the hypermethylation of CpG islands. <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">By altering DNA methylation we can alter how available DNA to be expressed. As methylation is mitotically heritable, if a drug alters methylation its impact will continue after the drug is discontinued. <br /><br />Sensitive periods are periods where changes in the environment are going to have the biggest effect.<br /><br />The 2 sensitive periods of development are the germ cell development and early embryonic development.<br /><br />Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable as we do not know what the long term effects of the current treatments are.<br /></div>
