    <h1>Submission 522 from Anon (session_user_id: 980cbfe7eff0c34274d53e5659fe760286740dad)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent which inhibits the activity of the enzyme EZH2, responsible for carrying out DNA methylation.  In Cancers, such as lymphomas, EZH2 is overexpressed and silences <span>tumour-suppressor genes, responsible for stopping the uncontrolled cell growth. Thus, </span>the proliferation of tumour cells is restricted by the inactivation of the DNA-methylating EZH2 enzyme by its inhibitor Decitabine. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division thus, affecting multiple cellular generations<br /></li><li>It's a period of intense epigenetic reprogramming when subtle changes in the organism's environment can lead to great changes in its epigenomics. E.g: Pre-implantation and during the gestational period</li><li>The epigenetic reprogramming (methylation and demethylation of genes) plays an important role in controlling the allele specific, gametes formation the expression of lineage-specific genes that cannot be over/underactive during tissue differentiation (i.e. when cells beggin to differentiate and form different tissues and organs).</li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>CpG islands are promoter regions for most of human genes. Usually, DNA methylation represses gene transcription by attracting repressing proteins or by blocking transcription factors from binding to the promoter
sequences itself.</li><li>CpG islands are usually not methylated regardless of their activity. However, in cancer, promoter CpG islands are hypermethylated thus silencing the following gene such as a tumour-supressor gene, responsible for maintaining cellular growth, DNA-repair proteins or apoptosis inducers. </li><li>In normal cells, lncRNAs, which play an important role in chromatin regulation and gene expression, are transcribed from <span>intergenic regions between genes and contain H3K4me3 (active) and H3K36me3 (active) domains, where it attaches itself and assembles protein complexes to their target DNA sequence. Methylation in repetitive elements</span> represses transcriptional noise from alternative start sites, inhibit antisense transcription or direct RNA splicing and is related to replication timing.<br /></li><li>In cancer, there is a <span>genome-wide loss (including satellite repeats) and a regional gain of DNA methylation (especially at CpG islands), causing genomic instability due to uncontrolled protein transcription, deregulation of both tissue specific and imprinted genes and the silencing of tumor suppressor genes</span>.</li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The lncRNA AIR (expressed by the father allele) which silences the maternal copy of the Igf2 gene by targeting the H3K9 histone methyltransferase (gene activator) at the H19 promoter site, thus allowing only the father's copy to be methylated at the H19 region and letting the Igf2 free from the CTCF,  which binds to the
unmethylated maternal chromosome and prevents enhancers
located downstream of H19 from accessing the maternal Igf2
promoter. <br />In Wilm's tumour, the maternal chromosome reverses to a methylated H19 promoter and Igf2 is switched on, and H19 switched off, causing increased cell growth by the hyperexpression of Igf2 which binds to the Igf1 receptor to initiate intracellular signaling cascades that lead to a higher rate of cell proliferation.<br /></div>
