    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value">1. In a normal state, the CpG islands are hypomethylated. <br />2. In cancer, CpG islands are hypermethylated. <br />3. Hypermethylation of CpG islands contributes to cancer when the CpG islands are next to promotors of tumor supressor genes. The hypermethylation causes silencing of the tumor supressing genes and they cannot inhibit cancer growth. <br />4. In a normal state, the repetitive elements and intergenic regions are hypermethylated.<br />5. In cancer,the repetitive elements and intergenic regions are hypomethylated.<br />6. Hypomethylation in intergenic regions causes gene instability. The choromatin is open and there can be an illegitimate recombination which might cause, for example, reciprocal translocation, deletions or insertions in chromosomes. Hypomethylation in repetitive elements will make them active. they can copy themselves and jump around the genome and can activate unwanted genes or their promotor can and this may cause transcriptional abarrations. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">1. In the normal ICR of the H19/Igf2 cluster, the paternal allele is methylated so the CTCF cannot bind to it and the enhanceres act on Igf2 and it is expressed.<br />2. In the normal ICR of the H19/Igf2 cluster, the maternal allele is unmethylated so the CTCF insulator binds to it, acts on H19 and it is expressed while Igf2 is silenced. In summery, in a normal healthy state, Igf2 is being expressed only from the paternal allele.<br />3. In Wilm's tumor, the ICR on the maternal allele is methylated so the CTCF cannot bind, and Igf2 is expressed like in the paternal allele. That is, Igf2 is being expressed from both alleles, paternal and maternal. <br />4. This disruption causes a double amount of Igf2. Since Igf2 plays a role in growth, too much of it causes a tumor.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">1. Decitabine is an enzymatic epigenetic regulator and belongs to the subgroup of DNMTi - Dinucleotidemethyltransferase inhibitors.<br />2. Decitabine disrups DNA methylation: when the enzyme DNMT comes to methylate the DNA on the daughter strand, Decitabine binds irreversibily to it and inactivates the enzyme.<br />3. Decitabine's action is cell devision dependent: the more devisions, the less methylations there will be, since DNMT is inactivated by the drug. The lack of methylations in the cancer cells can cause cell death and hurts the tumor. Since cancer cells are deviding more rapidly than most other cells in the body, the cancer cells will be more severly affected.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">1. Methylation is mitotically heritable, since DNMT copies the methylation to the daughter strand of the DNA when cells divide and therefore it is maintained. Alternatively, if DNMT does not act, the methylation is being "diluted" during cell divisions and finlally it is lost. <br />2. A sensitive period is a period of epigenetic reprogramming when the epigentic marks are being reset. <br />3. Sensitive periods of development are during early developments (embryonic stage), during PGC formation and during germ cells formation.<br />4. Treating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable since it might change the epigenetic makeup of many cells and tissues and cause unwanted genes to be activated and others to be silneced. It can also affect imprinting regions if given in PGC formation and that itself can cause cancer. </div>
