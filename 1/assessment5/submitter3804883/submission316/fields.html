    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are sites rich in CpG dinucleotides near the start of genes. In normal cells, these islands are unmethylated.  In cancer, CpG islands become highly methylated. <br /><br />The hypermethylation of CpG islands contributes to cancer because the increased methylation stops the tumour suppressor genes from being transcribed, allowing unfettered cell division and increased genomic instability. Additionally, the CpG island shores, the 2 kb region around a CpG island, show an increased level of methylation in cancer. <br /> <br />Methylation levels at intergenic regions and in the repetitive elements is high in normal cells. These areas of the genome are susceptible to mutations and instability, so maintaining methylation in these regions is important for overall genomic integrity. In cancer, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements become hypomethylated. The hypomethylation of the repetitive elements and intergenic regions affect the overall stability of the genome by allowing transcription in these areas. Repetitive elements are sensitive to transcription because they are prone to error. The intergenic regions are also important in DNA regulation as they may contain promoters or enhancers for nearby genes or they may be important the spacing of genes. In normal cells, intergenic regions are methylated, but they become unmethylated in cancer.<br /><br />One hallmark of cancer is genome wide hypomethylation.  Despite the high levels of methylation at the CpG islands and shores, overall, the level of methylation in a cancer cell is much lower than a normal cell. The epigenome becomes incorrectly methylated in cancer. Parts of the genome that normally highly methylated, such as the intergenic regions, become hypomethylated while the active portions of the genome become hypermethylated. There is a breakdown in the genetic architecture resulting in uncontrolled cell division and increasing levels of genetic instability. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Changing DNA methylation will have a lasting effect on the genome of the daughter cells. Under normal circumstances, the epigenetic changes to DNA are mitotically heritable through DNA methyltransferase, which is attracted to the hemimethylated DNA. </p><p>Sensitive periods are times when the genome is undergoing epigenetic changes, including early embryonic and primordial germ cell development. During the early embryonic period, the genome is either actively or passively demethylated (paternal or maternal respectively). Interference during this time period may alter the resetting of the epigenetic marks, which should persist for the lifetime of the cells and all future daughter cells. During primordial germ cell development, the imprinted genes have their epigenetic marks reset, which is crucial for the activation of certain parentally imprinted genes. If the gene has the wrong marks and is incorrectly expressed, it can have profound consequences for the organism.</p><p>One would have to weigh the risks in treating a person with an epigenetic drug such as a histone deacetylase inhibitor during a sensitive period. It would be inadvisable normally, but if this is the best drug and would ensure survival for a person, then it might be preferred even given the risk to a future generation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a hypomethylating drug that inhibits DNA methyltransferase. <br /><br />Methylation is an epigenetic modification of DNA by the addition of methyl groups. Methyl groups affect how the underlying DNA is transcribed, including whether it can be transcribed at all. High levels of methyl groups inhibit transcription machinery in DNA. Under normal circumstances, these patterns of methylation are mitotically stable and all subsequent daughter cells will carry the same epigenetic marks. <br /><br />In cancer, the tumour suppressor genes become methylated and cannot be accessed by the cell's transcriptional machinery. This derangement of the epigenetic marks can lead to the growth of cancer cells or in the case of MDS, immature blood cells, which are ineffective, and continue dividing and producing more ineffective blood cells. <br /><br />Decitabine blocks DNA methyltransferase from the cells and reduces methylation levels over successive generations. This may produce an anti-tumour effect by reducing the methylation on tumour suppressor genes.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprinting is an epigenetic mechanism by which certain genes are expressed in a parent of origin specific manner.  In the H19/Igf2 cluster, imprinting is achieved through enhancer blocking on the maternal allele. On the maternal allele, CTCF, a protein binds to the DNA blocking the downstream enhancers and subsequent expression of Igf2 while upregulating the expression of H19. On the paternal allele, there is no CTCF protein to block enhancers and methylation spreads across the H19 gene blocking its expression, but enabling the downstream enhancers to upregulate the expression of Igf2. <br /><br />When genomic imprints are not set properly during gametogenesis, the result can be an imprinting disorder like Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. BWS is an overgrowth disorder resulting from improper expression of Igf2 from both parental alleles rather than only the paternal allele. If the maternal allele expresses Igf2, then it will not express H19, which down-regulates cell proliferation. This combination of factors can lead to growth of Wilms' tumour. The disruption of genomic imprinting at the H19/Igf2 can lead to aberrant cell proliferation as both Igf2 alleles are expressed, which is 100% increase in the dosage of this allele. Cancer is  associated with excess cell proliferation, as in this case.</div>
