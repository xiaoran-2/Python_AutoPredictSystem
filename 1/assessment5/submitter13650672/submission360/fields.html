    <h1>Submission 360 from Anon (session_user_id: 8b915ce55a701d7f73a7be384b4c1f7d29d13fd5)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the DNA demethylating class of
      epigenetic inhibitors which removes methyl groups from DNA in cancerous
      cells. DNA
      methylation, which causes gene silencing, is found at CpG
      islands before the promoters of tumor suppressor
      genes. Removing methyl groups from DNA at these locations will allow
      tumor suppressor genes to be reactivated and expressed in cancerous cells
      allowing the cell to once again regulate its growth. In this way
      Decitabine has an anti-tumor effect.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, the
      altered DNA methylation in one cell is passed on, enduring cell
      division, to all of its daughter cells and to their daughter cells and so
      on and so forth. A sensitive period is anytime the entire genome undergoes
      epigenetic mark erasure and reprogramming. This occurs during primordial germ
      cell development and the early stages of development (from fertilized egg to
      blastocyst). Treating patients during sensitive periods would be
      inadvisable because the treatment could interfere with the reprograming
      of epigenetic marks or lay down epigenetic marks of its own which could
      lead to death, cancer, or disease.

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The paternal allele is methylated at the H19/Igf2 ICR
allowing the enhancers to act on Igf2, promoting its expression. The maternal
allele is unmethylated at the H19/Igf2 ICR allowing CTCF to bind to the ICR. The
enhancers then act on the H19 gene, promoting its expression, and the Igf2 gene
is not expressed. In Wilm’s tumor, both the maternal and paternal H19/Igf2 ICRs
are methylated leading to twice the normal expression level of Igf2. Since Igf2
is a growth promoting gene, doubling the level of Igf2 in the cell leads to a cancerous
kidney tumor. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, when CpG island DNA methylation does occurs,
although not often, it silences the gene it precedes. In cancer, CpG islands are
hypermethylated. Since CpG islands are generally found before the promoters of
tumor suppressor genes, the methylation of CpG island DNA promotes an inactive,
silent state for the gene(s) after the island. Therefore, the tumor suppressor
genes are not expressed and unregulated cell growth can proliferate
contributing to cancer. DNA methylation found in intergenic regions and
repetitive elements functions to maintain genome stability. In cancer, however,
the DNA of intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated. This contributes
to cancer because without DNA methylation, recombination between repeats, activation
of repeats and their transposition throughout the genome, and the activation of
cryptic promoters and neighboring genes can occur leading to translocations,
deletions, insertions, and overall genomic instability.</p></div>
