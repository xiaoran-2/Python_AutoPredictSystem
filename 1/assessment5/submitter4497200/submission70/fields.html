    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are generally unmethylated, but methylation of CpG islands is almost always associated with silencing the genes that upstream of itself.  In cancer, CpG islands that are not supposed to be silenced may become methylated, leading to hypermethylation of CpG islands.  Once this happens, activation, lack of activaion, transcription and replication errors will occur, usually leading to the uncontrolled replication.  DNA methylation at intergeneic regions and IAPs limits the process of transcription in the locations where it should not be occurring.  In cancer, they become demethylated, leading to the transcription of regions that should not have been active.  DNA can be transcribed at random and with potentially bad results.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normally, the paternal allele is expressed for igf2 while the maternal allele is methylated.  The methylation of the paternal allele will silence the paternal igf2.  The activation of the maternal igf2 has been connected with Wilm's Tumor.  This can lead to the overexpression of igf2.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The drug known as Decitabine works on the enzyme EZH2.  Per the article, a mutation causes EZH2 to become overactive.  This has the effect of methylating more histones than it should and silencing genes that should not be silenced, including tumor-suppressing genes.  Decitabine acts to inhibit the overactivity of EZH2, reducing the overmethylation caused by EZH2.  Decitabine also had the effect of reducing the spreading of tumor cells.  Decitabine was also described as having no apparent effect on nearby healthy cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>DNA methylation is can have enduring effects on the epigenome by virtue of mitotically inheritable.  As the DNA is replicated, the methylation is passed on to the next generation, and so on.</div><div><br /></div><div>Sensitive periods in development are when the epigenome is most susceptible to environmental and other effects.  These periods include the time between a gamete and up the epiblast stage of early development, then again in primordial germ cells (PGC development). There is also evidence from rat studies that during the type prenatal care given had a lasting effect on the rats babies.  It would dangerous to treat cells during sensitive periods as it could hinder the proper development of the DNA as methylation is reapplied.  Also, during early childhood, there is evidence of lasting epigenetic effects on the health and development of a child.(1)</div><div><br /></div><div>(1)<a href="http://genes2brains2mind2me.com/2009/12/04/epigenetic-loss-of-an-insensitive-period-of-cognitive-development/">http://genes2brains2mind2me.com/2009/12/04/epigenetic-loss-of-an-insensitive-period-of-cognitive-dev...</a></div></div>
