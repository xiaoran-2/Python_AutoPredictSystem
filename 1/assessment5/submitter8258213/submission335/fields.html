    <div class="field-value">Alterations in DNA methylation that leads to cancer can be of two types- locus specific DNA hypermethylation and genome wide DNA hypomethylation.<br /><br />DNA methylation usually doesn't occur at<em> CpG islands(hypomethylated)</em> , but when it occurs its involved with silencing of gene expression( X chromosome inactivation).In cancer cells, the CpG islands are more likely to be methylated than in normal cells<em>(hypermethylated)</em>.They are hyper methylated, in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes therefore, they silence them and now that this occurs epigenetically it is mitotically heritable and is rapidly selected therefore, it can act as one of the hits in Knudson hypothesis (cancer is the result of multiple hits to DNA).<br /><br />In our genome the <em>intergenic regions and repetitive elements</em> are usually methylated(<em>hypermethylated)</em>, this helps<em> maintaining the genomic integrity</em> for example- by silencing cryptic transcription start sites (or) cryptic splice sites in intergenic regions and by silencing repeats to prevent transpositions, transcriptional interference from strong promoter and to prevent illegitimate recombination in repetitive elements<em>.In cancer cells the intergenic regions , repetitive elements and introns are unmethylated (or) hypomethylated</em> when compared to normal cells this leads to <em>genomic instability by illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes</em>.Here for example- illegitimate recombination between repeats doesn't occur in normal cells because it would be heavily methylated and they would be hetero chromatinized (densely packed) but in case of cancer, we have hypomethylation of intergenic elements therefore, they misalign and align and as a result this illegitimate recombination occurs as they are not densely packed into hetero chromatin .<br /><br />It is to be noted that Global level of methylation is decreased and methylation at some CpG islands are dense in metastatic tissue when compared to normal tissue.And the role of DNA methylation is context dependent.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Alterations in DNA methylation at imprint control regions can result in loss of expression of growth resisting genes (or) over expression of growth promoting genes.<br /><br />In the example H19/ Igf2 cluster , the imprint control region is<em> methylated on the pate</em><i>rnal allele</i> therefore, CTCF complex will not bind to the ICR's and H19 region remains silent, while the enhancers act on Igf2 gene and is expressed.<br /><br />In<i> maternal allele</i>, the imprint control region is <em>unmethylated</em> and in this case the CTCF complex will bind to the ICR therefore, the downstream enhancers will act on H19 gene but the Igf2 gene remains silent.<br /><br />In case of <i>Wilm's tumor</i>, there is loss of imprinting and hypermethylation that occurs in imprint control regions of the maternal allele therefore, Igf2 is expressed and in case of paternal allele it is already methylated therefore,<em> Igf2 gene is now expressed as twice as compared to a normal cell</em>. The Igf2 gene is growth promoting therefore, this leads to Wlim's tumor that is a kidney tumor in observed in children that may lead to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to DNA methyltransferase inhibitors and is a hypomethylating agent that is used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome, precursor of acute myelogenous leukaemia.<br /><br />Decitabine is a chemical analogue of cytidine, a nucleoside present in DNA. It is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects following its conversion to decitabine triphosphate, where the drug is directly incorporated into DNA and <em>inhibits DNA methyltransferase, the enzyme that is responsible for methylating DNA</em>, this results in reactivation of silenced tumor suppressor genes via hypomethylation.<br /><br />Decitabine induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cellular differentiation and prolifration. In rapidly dividing cells, the cytotoxicity of the decitabine may also be attributed to the formation of covalent adducts between DNA methyltransferase and decitabine that has been incorporated into DNA. Here the advantage is, unlike other forms of gene regulation, epigenetic changes are <em>mitotically heritable.</em><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">We know that unlike other forms of gene regulation, <em>epigenetic changes acts like a switch</em> which can be turned on and off, that serves as a base for cancer treatments and mainly they are <em>mitotically heritable</em> ( therefore, epigenetic therapies may stop a cancer growing without having to kill all the cells) therefore, these two factors that implies that DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome.<br /><br />But these may lead to the disruption of epigenetic state (or) epigenetic reprogramming and most importantly during sensitive periods. These are periods where changes ( such as environment) will lead to adverse effects. The two main periods that are involved in active epigenetic reprogramming are- <em>during preimplantation and early post implantation periods, and the period of primordial germ cell development to production of mature sperms/eggs.</em><br /><br />As mentioned earlier, we know that epigenetic reprogramming occurs during these intervals (or) periods therefore, they are highly sensitive. Any minute changes (may be environmental or chemical) may have a serious and lasting effect due to transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. Therefore, it is inadvisable to treat patients during these periods.</div>
