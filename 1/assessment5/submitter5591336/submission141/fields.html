    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normal function: DNA methylation not on CpG islands but on intergeneric regions and repeats.<br />In cancer cells: CpG islands are methylated, but intergeneric regions and repeats are not methylated.<br />DNA methylation of CpG islands is disrupted by age and environment.<br />DNA methylation of CpG islands is contributed to cancer because it is silencing the expression of tumor suppression genes. <br />T<span>he normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is that both are silenced.<br /></span>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer by age and environment.<br />DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to cancer because it causes genomic instability.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The methylation of the paternal ICR results in not binding of CTCF so the<span> enhancers can acces Lgf2 promotor thus Lgf2 is expressed, the methylation of the ICR results also in methylation of H19 promotor so H19 is not expressed.<br />T</span><span>he ICR of the maternal allele is not methylated thus CTCF can bind on it and it blocks the enhancers from accessing the Igf2 promotor and they instead promote H19 expression.<br />I</span>n Wilm’s tumour is caused by a hypermethilation of the maternal ICR so CTCF cannot bind on the ICR so the enhancers can acces Lgf2 promotor thus Lgf2 is expressed, the methylation of the ICR results also in methylation of H19 promotor so H19 is not expressed.this results in a paternal expression AND a maternal expression of Igf2 (this is a growth factor and to much of it contributes to cancer).<br />Disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer because Igf2 is a growth factor and to much of it contributes to cancer and H19 is an enhancer blocker and to little of it contributes also to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Decitabine is a DNA-demethyline agent.<br />In cancer cells the CPG islands are methylated so the tumor suppressor genes cannot be exprest.<br /></span>Decitabine de-metylates CpG islands so the tumor suppressor genes can be expressed.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">A<span>ltering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because epigenetic changes are passed on during (mitotic) cell devision.<br />A </span>sensitive period is a period when the epigenetic marks are establisht.<br />Sensitive periods of development are early development and Germ cell devellopment.<br />Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because during these periods epigenetic marks are actively established (Methylation and acytilation).</div>
