    <h1>Submission 130 from Anon (session_user_id: ad6ba83951785316d04cdf194bad00661f2641b8)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to a class of epigenetic drugs that are known as DNA demethylating agents. Like azacitidine, Decitabine inhibits the action of DNA methytransferase thereby hypomethylating DNA.  It gets incorporated in to DNA strands which then can not be methylated. <br />It is used for myelodysplastic syndrome. Hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes is the hallmark of cancer. The antineoplastic effects could be due to hypomethylating activity that may restore the normal function of genes crtitical for controling proliferation and differentiaiton. In rapidly growing cells, it can be incorporated into DNA and forms a bond with DNA methyltransferase thereby inhibiting methylation.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Dr. Baylin used histone deacetylase inhibitor in combination with azcitidine, a demethylating agent, in solid tumors. Both epigenetic drugs could have altered the DNA structure by hypomethylation, and deacetylation of histone ,  required for maintaing the genomic integrity. Since epigenetic changes are passed on mitotically to daughter cells, these changes could have slowed the tumor growth by restoring some of the normal functions of a cell. And also these epigenetic changes could open the DNA chrpmatin and  making these cells more susceptible to routine chemotherapeutic agents.<br />Sensitive periods  are during reprogramming (that is removal and re-establishment) of epigenetic marks occurs. This is the most sensitive time when DNA is vulnerable to outside influences like toxins, chemical or environmental.<br /><br />There are 2 sensitive periods during development: 1) during gametogenesis and 2) after fertilization.  <br /><br />Any treatment during these sensitive periods can cause changes in establishing the epigenetic marks. These changes in methylation or acetylation can  cause upregulation or repression of expression of a gene, that are imprinted in a parent of origin specific manner and, lead to various disease (like diabetes or cancer ) later in life.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation occurs in the whole genome at CpG islands and is generally involved in silencing of transcription. Another role may be to recruit  protein complexes at methylation sites that bind the region,  like histone modifiers, and can cause chromatin rearrangements which leads to changes in the transcription. Generally, CpG islands in the gene promotors are not methylated so that gene can be transcribed. However, CpG dinucleotides within a gene are methylated to maintain the integrity of genome. DNA methylation is also needed for imprinting  some alleles in a parent of origin manner.<br />In cancer, CpG islands in promotor regions of tumour suppressor genes are hypermethylated leading to silencing of these genes due to chromatin rearrangement. However, CpG islands in other parts of genome like oncogenes or within genes are hypomethylated. This leads to changes in nuclear chromatin arrangement and causes dysregulation in cell functions due to changes in transcription. These epigenetic changes are mitotically inherited resulting in increased number of dysregulated cells leading to cancer. <br /> DNA methylation in intergenic region and repetitive elements  maintains the genome stability and integrity. Methylation at intergenic regions prevents alternative transcription and splicing site. Repetitive elements can insert themselves in other regions of the genome and methylation prevents it from getting transcribed.<br />In cancer cells, intergenic region and repetitive elements are hypomethylated resulting in changes in chromatin structure,  causing gene mutation and insertions due to incorrect genetic recombination or jumping of repetitive elements, leading to overexpression or silencing of a gene. Repetitive elements can transcribe and increase their copy numbers which can jump to another part of genome leading to increased expression of that gene or these insertion at a critical point can disrupt the expression of an important gene required for the normal function of a cell like cellular differentiation and prolliferation. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Igf2 allele is expressed in a parent of origin specific manner. and is dependent upon  two regulatory factors   1) imprinting control region(ICR) that is a binding site for insulator protein CTCF  and 2) its downstream  h19( long non-coding RNA).<br />In case of paternal allele, both ICR and its downstream h19 (paternally imprinted)  are methylated preventing the binding of CTCF,  resulting in tissue specific enhancers (downstream to h19) to  act on Igf2 upregulating its expression.<br />Maternal Igf2 allele is imprinted and is therefore not expressed.   ICR region in maternal allele is not methylated and is bound by  CTCF protein, thereby insulating it from enhancers. This prevents the binding of enhancer  to Igf2, however, it binds to h19 resulting in its expression.<br />In wilms tumor, Igf2 is expressed biallelic from maternal and paternal allele. This occurs due to loss of imprinting at maternal allele so ICR and h19 are methylated as seen in paternal allele and enhancers bind to Igf2 resulting in its upregulation. <br /><br />Loss of imprinting at maternal allele results in  lgf2 expression from parernal and maternal allele causing very high levels of growth promoting factor than is needed and this can contribute to cancer. <br /> </div>
