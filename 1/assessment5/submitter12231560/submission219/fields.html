    <h1>Submission 219 from Anon (session_user_id: afdb9cb7e7ecc1eeea245023c6baba0404a83ec6)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine (cytosine analog) belongs to DNMT inhibitors to treat MDS which causes Acute Myeloid lymphomas. They act as DNA demethylating agents which hypomethylates DNA. Since DNMT, an epigenetic machinery that adds methyl groups on genes say Tumor suppressor gene which is silenced causing tumor. The drug blocks the action of DNMT, that is by removing the methyl group, it allows the reexpression of TSG and thereby having an anti-tumor effect.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are dinucleotides that found in clusters in the promoter regions upstream at the 5' end of Tc start site and spread throughout the genome. They are unmethylated in a normal state at the promoter regions and methylated globally in other regions such as intergenic and repetitive elements. In a diseased state like cancer, an opposite phenomenon is observed. The CpGs are hypermethylated resulting in silencing of genes. So when a tumor suppressor gene like Retinoblastoma (Rb) is hypermethylated, the gene is transcriptionally silenced causing tumorgenesis. When a gene is hypermethylated, the methyl binding proteins (meCp2) are recruited to these regions that HDAC bind to causing chromatin wound up to heterochromatin and gene silencing.These aberrant changes are then inherited and passed on to daughter cells. CpGs are hypomethylated globally (at a protooncogene). This results in chromatin rearrangement flaws, recomination, deletion flaws. There also is loss of imprinting of genes (Igf2) that leads to colorectal cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">A normal paternal allele has the Igf2 gene expressed as the enhancers directly act on the igf2 gene. ICR is methyated and the H19 also methylated. A normal maternal allele sees Igf2 imprinting and hence the gene is silenced. The ICR is bound with insualtor CTCF protein and hence are blocked for access by enhancers. The enchancers directly act on the H19 gene expressing them. In a Wilms tumor, Igf2 is overexpressed with loss of imprinting at the maternal allele (as ICR is hypermethylated, and not accessible for the enhancers ). A loss of imprinting is associated with growth promotion which causes a childhood kidney tumor. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation an epigenetic modification unlike genetic changes are reversible. The sensitive periods are time of embryogenesis and primodial germ cell development and it is during these times there is rapid reprogramming of epigenetic marks. They are then maintained during the lifetime of the adult. But when drugs are targeted at this reprogramming stage, they will interfere with the development process and hence it is inadvisable.</div>
