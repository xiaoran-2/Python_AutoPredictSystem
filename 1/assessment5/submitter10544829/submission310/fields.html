    <h1>Submission 310 from Anon (session_user_id: d104a10d1b99abe28d4e61fa61c91cf6dc4dcaf8)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyl transferase inhibitor which acts by repressing the methylation of DNA to leave it hypomethylated. In normal tissue, when methylated DNA is replicated at cell division, the newly created daughter DNA strand will be unmethylated. The enzyme DNA methyl transferase (DNMT) acts by recognising DNA which is hemi-methylated and adds a methyl group to the unmethylated CpG dinucleotide. Locus specific DNA hypermethylation at both the CpG islands in the promoters of tumour suppressors and imprint control regions can lead to tumourigenesis. </p><p>Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue and so becomes incorporated into DNA when replicated. DNMT then binds irreversibly to DNA and therefore cannot be released for future DNA methylation. As it is dependent on cell division to act and since cancer cells are rapidly dividing, DNA demethylation occurs and so the drug targets cancer cells. It is particularly effective at low doses and in myelodysplastic syndrome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, CpG islands, regions of dense Cytosine/Guanine dinucleotides exist in the promoters of genes and are unmethylated allowing transcription factors to bind and gene expression. When methylated, methylated CpG binding proteins (which contain transcriptional repression domains) bind to them as well as recruiting other factors resulting in chromatin condensation and gene silencing.</p><p>In cancer, these areas become methylated at the promoters of tumour suppressor genes. When tumour suppressor genes become silenced, this paves the way for cancer to develop. An example of such a gene which may become epigenetically silenced is BRCA1 in breast cancer. BRCA1 is a protein which is involved in DNA repair and so if this mechanism is disrupted by the silencing of BRCA1 expression, this can lead to genetic instability. Silencing by DNA methylation can act as one of the "hits" required by Knudson's hypothesis for both alleles of a tumour suppressor gene to be compromised and tumourogenesis to occur.</p><p>In normal cells, intergenic regions are generally methylated and this is necessary for genomic stability. In the absence of methylation of intergenic regions, studies show that gene deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations are more likely. Intergenic methylation can also act to silence cryptic promoters and cryptic splice sites which can disrupt normal gene expression. DNA methylation at repetitive elements also acts to maintain genomic integrity. Repetitive elements copy and paste themselves at various areas in the genome and so can disrupt normal gene function, for instance if they pasted themselves inside a gene promoter. Silencing them prevents this from happening. </p><p>Disruption of methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements therefore leads to genomic instability which is one of the hallmarks of cancer (Hanahan and Weinberg 2000). This instability leads to the mutations, some of which will be able to contribute to tumourigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting is a mechanism whereby genes on the maternal and paternal allele are expressed differently. On the paternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster, the imprint control region (ICR) is methylated and so the insulator protein CTCF will not bind to the ICR thus allowing Igf2 to be expressed rather than supressing it.</p><p>On the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated. When unmethylated, CTCF will bind to the ICR an insulator protein which silences transcription of Igf/2 but allows the enhancers to facilitate transcription of H19.</p><p>In Wilm's tumour, hypermethylation of the ICR on the maternal allele drives expression of Igf2. Igf2 is therefore expressed by both alleles providing a "double dose" compared to the situation described above. Igf2 is a growth promoter and consequently, a larger than normal dose of a growth promoter disrupts normal. Cancer is a disease of uncontrolled growth and self-sufficiency in growth signals is a hallmark of cancer (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000). In this case this imbalance leads to kidney tumour development in children. Imprinting as a result of hypermethylation is thought to be an early event in tumourigenesis as it is often seen in early the cells of early stage tumours.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable which means that they remain in newly created cells after cell division and so can be maintained for the life of an organism over several years and even in future generations when passed on via transgenerational epigenetic inheritance via the germ cells.</p><p>There are two main periods when the epigenome is sensitive to changes in the environment, which include the effects of IVF, tobacco smoke, diet and chemicals. Periods susceptible are those when active remodelling of the epigenome takes place and include firstly the period of primordial germ cell development until the formation of mature gametes and secondly, from pre-implantation to early post implantation periods when epigenetic remodelling takes place. Less sensitive periods occur during somatic maintenance periods when epigenetics are maintained although there are brief periods when susceptibilities may arise for instance during tissue specific differentiation although these are less sensitive than the above two .<br /></p><p>Using treatments which affect epigenetics during these periods are inadvisable because the epigenetic changes that occur will be mitotically heritable having long lasting effects on gene expression through lifetime of the patient and even being potentially passed on to later generations.</p></div>
