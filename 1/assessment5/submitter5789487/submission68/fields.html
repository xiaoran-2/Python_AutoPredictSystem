    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG
islands are normally un-methylated allowing transcription of the adjacent gene.
In cancer CpG islands are hypermethylated silencing adjacent genes. Turning off
tumor suppressor genes contributes to cancer.</p>

<p><span>Intergenic
regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated to keep them inactive.
In cancer these become unmethylated allowing transcription of the genes. Many
of these are growth promoters so allowing their expression contributes to
cancer.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The
ICR of the paternal allele is methylated preventing insulator CTFC binding.
This allows the enhancers to act at the Igf2 promotor and hence expression of
the IgF2 gene. The maternal allele is unmethylated at the ICR allowing binding
of the insulator CTFC. This allows transcription of H19 which in turn prevents
transcription of the IgF2 gene.</p>

<p><span>In
Wilm’s tumor the maternal allele ICR is also methylated leading to a double
dose of the IgF2 gene. IgF2 is a growth promotor and hence it’s role in cancer.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a DNA methylation
inhibitor that leads to a decrease in DNA methylation. Decreasing DNA
methylation would lead to increased expression of genes including the tumour
suppressor genes.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable
leading to preservation of its effects as cells divide. Sensitive periods are
when the epigenome is reset during development i.e many epigenetic marks are
removed and replaced. The two sensitive periods of development are in early development
of the embryo immediately post fertilization and during development of the primordial
germ cells. Treating patients who are pregnant would affect the epigenome of
the baby if very early in development or the primordial germ cells of a female infant
if later in pregnancy. Treatment during sperm production would also be harmful should
any progeny be produced during the time of treatment.</span></p></div>
