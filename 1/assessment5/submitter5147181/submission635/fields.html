    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation is one of the aberrations seen in
epigenetic control of cancer, which can be analyzed in two ways: 1) Locus specific
DNA hypermethylation, with a clear example in the CpG island. In a normal cell
these CpG island are hypomethylated, thereby facilitating gene expression and
in the case of tumour suppressor genes can do their function of regulate the
cell proliferation, unlike a cancer cell in which these CpG island are
hypermethylated. The principal target genes for hypermethylation are for
example, tumor suppressor genes as <i>Rb</i>
in retinoblastoma among others, which if they have a mutation with loss of
function or simply, they are silencing through hypermethylation, the cell
proliferation is dysregulated and at the end contribute to cancer develop.  2. Genome-wide DNA hypomethylation, with a
clear example in intergenics regions and repetitive elements, which in a normal
cell are methylated contributing to the maintenance of genomic stability. In a
cancerous cell these regions are hypomethylated basically, for DNA
methyltranferases mutations which, contributes to a state of genomic
instability by allowing incorrect recombination between non-homologous
chromosomes (deletions, insertions or translocations), transposons activation,
etc., thus increasing the number of mutations leading eventually the
development of cancer.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Another
example of epigenetic aberration in controlling cancer is seen in the loss of
imprinting. In the case of H19 / Igf2 cluster, It is a clear example of
imprinting that can be disrupted in contribute to develop of cancer.</p>

<p><span>In a normal
cell, Igf2 is maternal imprinting i.e. It is in a state of methylation (gene
silencing) being only the paternal allele expressed, intensified by enhancers.
Moreover, H19<i> </i>is paternal imprinting,
which implies that is methylated (gene silencing) and his ICR as well, unlike
the maternal allele, which is demethylated join to ICR. CTCF is binding to ICR
and enhancers can intensify the expression of the maternal H19 allele.</span></p>

<p><span>In a cancer
cell, both paternal and maternal H19 allele and their respective ICR are
hypermethylated and the Igf2 maternal allele has lost its status of imprinting,
so now is demethylated and active, then the expression of both Igf2 alleles are
intensified by enhancers. Overexpressing of Igf2 (Human insulin-like growth
factor II gene) leads to an increase in cell proliferation signal (increased
concentration of ligand) which if not controlled, constantly stimulates cell
proliferation and cancer development.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>DNA methylation is known for being mitotically heritable. This may be one reason why DNA methylation can last in the epigenome.<br /><br /></div><div>A sensitive period is one in which the epigenetic reprogramming occurs. There are two moments or sensitive periods of development, which are: 1) during the formation or maturation of germ cells, 2) during early embryonic development. Both periods are critical times, as is the time in which specific epigenetic marks are established, imprinting patterns are set, i.e. epigenetic reprogramming processes occur.<br /><br /></div><div>An alteration process epigenetic reprogramming during the development of germ cells can lead to the development of disease in subsequent generations, similarly alteration of epigenetic reprogramming during embryonic development can lead to diseases or syndromes in the adult organism, since that DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. For these reasons, we should avoid treatment with these types drugs during these sensitive periods.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Decitabine is an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase and is a drug used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukemia.<br /><br /></div><div>Decitabine Inhibits DNMT, through proteasomal degradation depletes DNMT1, you induce DNA hypomethylation overall, and Increases expression of specific genes through mechanisms both dependent on as well as independent of promoter hypomethylation.<br /><br /></div><div>Decitabine may help prevent the development of cancer by inhibiting the DNMT which may not act hypermethylando the CpG island and therefore the tumor suppressor genes may be active and be expressed. Having active copies of these tumor suppressor genes, cell proliferation can be regulated to avoid the generation of tumors.</div></div>
