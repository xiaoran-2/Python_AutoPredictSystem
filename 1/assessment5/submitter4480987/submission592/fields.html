    <div class="field-value">Globally, DNA tends to be hypometylated--which is associated with open chromatin and transcription. So, loss of methylation around growth genes may lead to increased expression of these genes and increased risk for cancer. However, CpG islands and their shores tend to become hypermethylated in cancer. Normally, when CpG islands in promoters are unmethylated, this will promote transcription. Hypermethylation of islands can lead to silencing of genes that normally prevent cancer (e.g., tumor suppressor genes). Hypomethylation of intergenic regions, repeats, and transposons can cause genomic instability and also lead to cancer. This is because methylation protects against abnormal recombination and the insertion of transposons in other parts of the genome (this can affect gene transcription, nuclear architecture).

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Another way that methylation plays an important role in cancer is through
 hypomethylation of genes associated with growth and through loss of 
imprinting (which can be through hyper- or hypomethylation, and many imprinted genes are associated with cell growth/division). For 
example, the lectures describe IGF2 (a growth gene) overexpression as an
 example of loss of imprinting in cancer. Specifically, in Willms tumors, both maternal and paternal copies of H19 are hypermethylated, which leads to both alleles then transcribing IGF2 because CTCF cannot bind to the imprint control region after the H19 alterations and enhancers can promote IGF2.

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a drug that promotes de-methylation of DNA; it is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes. These drugs act by incorporating into the DNA of replicating cells and irreversibly binding DNA methyltransferases--which cannot then methylate DNA. The drugs are not cancer-specific, but will affect these cells most profoundly as they are rapidly dividing.

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable. So, epigenetic marks tend to be maintained through cell division. If these marks are altered in cancer cells, it stands to reason that they would be altered in subsequent cellular divisions. Epigenetic changes lead to transcriptional changes and possible alterations to nuclear architecture and chromatin conformation; accordingly, this different cellular environment may promote or allow for a cellular response to chemotherapeutic drugs.<br /><br />Because epigenetic altering drugs tend to not be cell specific, one must be aware of how administering these drugs can affect all cell types (especially during sensitive periods). The best example of this is human germ cells, which go through two periods of epigenetic alteration (right after fertilization and during maturation); these periods are sensitive, because environmental and pharmaceutical factors can alter the re-establishment of epigenetic marks. For example, inhibiting DNA methyltransferases may alter imprinting and re-methylation in germ cells and affect the health of a patient's offspring. Therefore, use of these drugs may be inadvisable in patients of reproductive age who are desirous of having children in the future.
