    <h1>Submission 278 from Anon (session_user_id: 3d02a61cfa3e4b9c2ad3b3b166bf437ee2991e10)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor that functions as a nucleoside analogue. It is incorporated to the DNA during the replication, at this stage, DNMT1 binds to the same sites where a methyl groups is going to be copied to the daughter strand, but its bound irreversibly and can't do its work. Decitabine also may  be acting by removing methyl groups from CpG islands. When these nucleotides are methylated, that usualy means gene silencing, but in this case Decitabine could do the opossite thing, taking off methyl groups from nucleotides so tumour repressor genes can be transcribed and translated into proteins.These proteins in turn have a direct effect over the regulation of cell growth. Another important consideration is that these modifications are heritable each time DNA is replicated producing a long-lasting effect on cells.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Methylation patterns tend to be distributed in a certain way in normal cells. In general terms, CpG islands are hypomethylated, while intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be hypermethylated. This pattern allows normal functioning of the cell by activating tumour supressor genes (due to unmethylated CpG islands found in the promoters) and giving genomic stability (because methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements is a hallmark that avoids the manifestation of chromosomal aberrations).<br /><br />In contrast, we can find that in cancer these patterns are altered. CpG islands are hypermethylated,and there's an increasing in this pattern as cancer progresses, while global methylation (e.g. repetitive elements, intergenic regions, introns, etc.) decreases. As a result cell growth is out of control because tumour supressor genes are silenced and cromosomal aberrations start to appear as genome-wide methylation pattern is disrupted.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">H19/Igf2 cluster disruption is an example of how imprinting alterations can contribute to cancer.  <br /><br />In a normal cell the imprinting control region (ICR) from the paternal allele and H19 are both methylated, leading to silencing of H19 and at the same time allowing the action of enhancers on Igf2,therefore Igf2 is expresesed. On the other hand, theres no methylation of H19 and ICR in the maternal allele, and there's ICR binding of an insulator component called CTCF. Enhancers can't act on Igf2 because of the insulator blockage, but they act on H19 and this protein is expressed.The overall result is a balance between growth restricting and promoting proteins expressed.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumour there's a disruption of this imprinting mechanism in the maternal allele, because its ICR is methylated and therefore it has the same behaviour as a normal paternal allele. The overall result is an overexpression of Igf2, a growth promoting protein, contributing to cancer also because theres's no expression of the restricting protein H19.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">An epigenetic drug can have a long-lasting effect in cells because epigenetic modifications are mitotically heritable. So even if you are not under treatment anymore, once you consume this kind of medication, changes in your cells are already stablished and pass on to next dividing cells. It is not advisable to use epigenetic drugs if patients are going through sensitive periods because abnormalities might occur and health status would be compromised. A sensitive period is a time of intensive epigenetics reprogramming such as formation of the embryo and its early development, formation of germ cells, etc. Because of the criticity of these development phases for the organisms, epigenetic modifiers have to be used with caution.<br /><br /><br /></div>
