    <h1>Submission 603 from Anon (session_user_id: 064bd01ab5f86c14b882903a04a034248c284617)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent. That means it inhibits DNA methylation.Currently Decitabine is sold under the trade name of Dacogen and is one of the 2 US FDA approved hypomethylating agent.<br />Decitabine works by reducing the methylation of DNA. Decitabine works only on DNA strands. Decitabine brings about hypomethylation by blocking the activity of DNA methyltransferase(responsible for DNA methylation).<br />Decitabine is administered against Myelodsyplastic Syndrome. Excessive methylation suppresses Anti tumor genes. Decitabine prevents these genes from being methylated and hence the anti tumor genes are expressed. in this manner Decitabine has anti tumor effect.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is disrupted in cancer at CpG islands. The CpG islands are hypermethylated and thus cause inactivation of Anti tumor genes. The methylation of these CpG islands in case of cancer is a well known phenomenon and scientist world over are working towards ways in which this can be tapped/exploited to effectively treat cancer.<br />The primary difference that can be seen in methylation of the genes in cancer and in normal case is the presence or absence of methylation at some specific loci. eg CpG islands usually aren't methylated whereas they are in the case of cancer. Thus when they are not methylated the genes which code for anti tumor are expressed. The suppression of these genes increases the the chances of cancer/ tumor formation.<br />The methylation with intergenic regions is different. The intergenic regions in the case of cancer are unmethylated while they are methylated otherwise.<br />The disruption of these can cause the onset of cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">When the methylation of promoter increases the expression of the H19 genes decreases becomes 0 and the expression of of Igf2 increases.<br />The increased H19 expression is associated with many types of cancers one of them being the Wilm's Tumor<br /><span>It has been found that  the hypermethylation of the H19 promoter on the paternal allele plays a vital role in allowing the expression of the paternal allele of IGF2.</span><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome. This was evidently seen through Dr. Baylin's experiments on patients suffering from cancer wherein he used Histone deacetylase and azacitidine. Patients showed positive response to this treatment and their tumor growth slowed down. Another noteworthy effect seen was in those patients who did not have much response to these 2 drugs but later when administered with routine chemotherapeutic drugs showed desirable effects.<br />Sensitive could mean the period when a patient is most vulnerable. Sensitive periods might be those when the first symptoms of cancer are seen or on the onset of cancer.<br /><br /></div>
