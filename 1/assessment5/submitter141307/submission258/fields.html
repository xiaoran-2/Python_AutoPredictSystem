    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cells CpG islands for are generaly unmethylated while in cancer cells they are more <br />likely to be methylated especially at shores of tumour suppressor genes. <br />Epigentic silencing of the tumour suppressor genes by methylation of their CpG islands means <br />that it is copied to the cancer cells children.   <br />Which specific tumour suppressor gene CpG is methylation depend on the tumour type.<br />In normal cells intergenic regions and repetitive elements are in general hypermethylated but <br />in cancer they are generaly hypomethylated.  <br />Demethylation of the repeats in cancer contribute to genetic instability. Via recombination between repeats, coping themselves and jump to other location of the genome or activating neighbouring genes.<br />Demethylation of intergenic regions can contribute to activation on nearby genes here <br />the effect on the cancers cells depend on the function of the gene.  <br /><br />Refs.)

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">On the paternal allele the ICR is normaly methylated which bloks H19 experesen and enhance Igf2 expression,   <br />on the maternal allele the ICR is unmetylated and binds the CTCF insulator protein this lead to expression and enhancing of H19 instead of Igf2.<br />In Wilm's tumour the ICR is methylated on both alleles and both behaves as the paternal allele which gives an over-expression of Igf2.<br />Igf2 is a growth promoter and over-expression contribute to the uncontrolled growth in cancer. <br />Ref.)

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine can be classed as an enzymatic epigenetic regulator, DNMT inhibitor, a DNA-demethylating agent or a nuceloside analogues.<br />Decitabine helps decrease DNA methylation by blocking the DNMT enzyme form laying down methylating. <br />If the tumour is driven by tumour suppressor hypermethylation then a DNMT inhibitor<br />agent like Decitabine can stop the methylation of the tumour suppressor genes to be passed on <br />to the next cell generation. Decitabine binds DNMT and don't release it again. <br />Because tumours divide more than normal cells the effect is bigger on tumours. <br /><br />Ref.) Lecture 7.9 and Cancer’s epicentre.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotic inhabitable and passed on to future generation of cells.<br />Epigenetic effect carried through the germ cells to children and grand children have also been observed.<br />Treating patients doing sensitive periods where epigenetic reprogramming take place can <br />have long lasting side effects. <br />This is periods of early pregnancy and in young patients where germ cells is still under development. <br /><br />ref.)
