    <h1>Submission 509 from Anon (session_user_id: 16816487dc8debe126029d3fbe68a3eb7713d9bf)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the category of DNA-demetylating agents, in other words, it decreases the level of DNA methylation. Decitabine archives this by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase which is required for DNA methylation. Hypermethylation of CpG islands, particularly in promoters of tumor suppressor genes, is one of the important epigenetic mechanisms involved in cancer. Consequently, demethylating these hypermethylated regions can lead to anti-tumor effects in certain types of cancer by re-activating the tupor supressor genes that have been made silent in cancer cells. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is one of the epigenetic marks that can be mitotically heritable. Consequently, altering DNA methylation of cells, from the state in the cancer cells to the normal or semi-normal state, can be maintained in the daughter cells of a cancer cell. This can therefore leads to lasting effects in the tumor cells that can make them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy. <br /><br />Sensitive periods are periods in the development of the animal where the epigenetic makeup of the cells are very susceptible to environmental effects. These include the period of primordial germ cell development, preimplantation period and early postimplantation period.  <br /><br />Treating patients during sensitive periods leads to hyper or hypomethylation of DNA or part of DNA. During  sensitive periods, some DNA methylation marks are removed and new ones are added. For instance, maternal chromosome should have the right maternally imprinted genes in the oocytes. Consequently, treating patients with drugs that alter DNA methylation during sensitive periods can lead to -- potentially transgenerationally-- heritable changes in DNA epigenetic marks which could themselves lead to sever disorders. It is with noting here that the primordial germ cells are already starting to develop when the embryo is developing in the placenta.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are located near or at transcriptional starting sites, e.g. promotes of various genes. Most CpG islands are normally protected from methylation. When they are methylated in some cases, this methylation leads to the silencing of the gene at or near whose promoter the CpG island is located. This happens for instance dynamically in some cell types and in X chromosome inactivation. <br /><br />In cancer, DNA methylation is disrupted for instance on the CpG islands at the promoters of tumor suppressor genes (when they are usually not methylated and get hypermethylated in cancer ) or in oncogenes, when their hypomethylation leads to excessive growth. <br /><br />DNA methylation is strongly present in intergeneric regions and repetitive elements and it surpasses the activation of their promotes which are usually very strong. The hypomethylation of these areas can lead to various problems mainly arising from genomic instability, e.g. via unwanted recombination, deletion or insertion of parts of genome. This genomic instability is another hallmark of cancer cells. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Many imprinted genes control growth and hypo- or hypermethylation of their ICRs play a role in cancer via their over- or under-expression. . For example, the Igf2 is normally expressed only from the paternal chromosome (paternally imprinted). This is achieved through the methylation of the ICR in the paternal chromosome and lack of this methylation in the maternal one. The ICR in this case is located between the H19 gene and an enhancer of H19/Igf2 on the one side and the Igf2 gene on the other side. The unmethylated ICR in the maternal chromosome allows CTFC to bind to it and block the action of the enhancer on Igf2, making the enhancer only access H19. The methylation of ICR on the paternal allele, however, blocks the binding of CTFC and thus allows the enhancer to reach to Igf2, leading to its expression. <br /><br />In Wilm's tumor the above pattern is disrupted through the methylation of the ICR on the maternal allele. This allows the enhancer to each Igf2, leading to the expression of Igf2 from the maternal allele (in addition to the paternal one) yielding a double dose of this growth factor and the development of the tumor.</div>
