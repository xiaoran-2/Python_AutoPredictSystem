    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">CpG islands normally remain unmethylated but tend to become hypermethylated in cancer, which causes silencing of tumor suppressor genes and could be one of the hits leading to cancer (Lecture 7.2)<br />On the other hand, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated in normal cells, while in cancer they tend to become hypomethylated and thereby contribute to cancer through genomic instability which includes phenomena such as "illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes" (Lecture 7.4).</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The paternal ICR (imprinting control region) allele is normally methylated, preventing the insulator CTCF from binding and thus allowing downstream enhancers to activate Igf2. On the maternal allele, the ICR is normally not methylated, and the ICR therefore binds CTCF which blocks Igf2 enhancers and thus prevents Igf2 activation (Lecture 4.4). In Wilm's tumor, the ICR is methylated on both the maternal and paternal alleles (hypermethylation), causing overexpression of the growth-promoting Igf2 and thereby contributing to cancer (Lecture 7.3).</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating or hypomethylating agent, or more specifically, a DNMT (DNA methyltransferase) inhibitor, which brings about DNA demethylation through incorporation into DNA and binding of DNMTs (Lecture 7.9). Decitabine may have an anti-tumor effect by keeping tumor suppressors unmethylated, allowing them to control cancerous cell proliferation (Lecture 7.9).</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable through the action of DNMT1 which copies DNA methylation in cell division (Lecture 1.6), so drugs that alter DNA methylation can cause epigenetic changes that are passed down through subsequent divisions of the affected cells. Sensitive periods are times of epigenetic reprogramming when the epigenome is more vulnerable to environmental exposures (such as drugs) and include early embryonic development and primordial germ cell development (Lecture 5.1). It may be inadvisable to treat certain patients such as pregnant women (with developing embryos) or children (with developing germ cells) due to possible epigenetic side effects.</div>
