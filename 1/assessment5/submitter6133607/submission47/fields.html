    <h1>Submission 47 from Anon (session_user_id: eca1298af42633fef4b1a4617457f20fd129f943)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the class of drugs called demethylating agents. Decitabine will remove methyl groups from DNA. These class of drugs can have a anti tumor effect by allowing certain genes to be expressed(tumor suppressors) and thus eliminating cancerous cell growth. Tumour suppressor genes keep unwarranted proliferation of cell in check.  <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In general, methylation is decreased in cancer and increased at CpG islands. Also, methylation is increased at CpG island shores, decreased at repetitive regions, decreased at intergenic regions and decreased at CpG poor promoters. The increase in methylation at CpG island causes an increase in cancer because the methylation silences tumor suppressor genes and as a result allows cellular proliferation to run wild. Tumor suppressor gene keeps proliferation in check. Reduced methylation in repetitive elements and intergenic regions causes genomic instability via illegitamate recombination. As a result, one can see chromosonal duplications and deletions because of homologous recombination of repetitive regions requires less sequence. Depending on where the duplications or deletions takes place can drive overexpression of growth genes and suppress tumor suppress genes thereby causing cancer. Methylation resolves that issue. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">For a particular locus/allele, one could see both the paternal and the maternal locus imprinted or neither locus imprinted. As a result, cancer could occur. Imprinted alleles usually are involved in growth, either promoting or suppressing.  In the case of the H19/Igf2 locus, the maternal locus is not  methylated and as a result the maternal allele expresses H19 because CTCF binds to the maternal ICR and blocks Igf2 from being expressed. Since the paternal allele is methylated at the H19 allele this allows the enhancers to activate Igf2 and Igf2 is expressed. In cancer, both the maternal and paternal allele are methylated, thus ICR's are blocked from CTCF from binding to DNA  and allow the over expression of Igf2 from both alleles and this results in cancer. This is what happens in Wilm's tumour, both the maternal and paternal allele are methylated and the CTCF are not permitted to bind at the ICR and as a result Ifg2 is expressed from both alleles thus over expression of Igf2, thus cancer. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have enduring effects because these modifications will be passed onto daughter cells and then granddaughter cells. So if tumour suppressor genes have been silenced by an epigenetic modification, this modification can be potenetially altered  by the addition of a DNA demethylating drug by removing methyl groups from the tumour suppressors allelles allowing the gene products to be made. One has to be conscience when using these drugs because they target all cells/areas. So age has to be taken into account because younger people are still developing their germ cells while older people are past this phase of life. The elderly view longevity and quality of life as the most important factors and thus don't view germ cells formation as an important factor when considering treatment . Sensitive period is the period in which the epigenetic marks are being established. So age must be taken into consideration because the epigenetic marks will be passed onto subsequent generation of cells.<br /></div>
