    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is a major aberration in epigenetic control of cancers. In normal cells, the methylated CpG islands relate to the formation of a repressive chromatin structure assisted by MecP proteins, thus leading to gene silence. And in intergenic regions and repetitive regions, DNA methylation can maintain genome stability. It can also silence cryptic transcription start sites or splice sites, and silence repeats to prevent transposititon.<br />While in cancer cells, CpG islands are hypermethylated, and sets of CpG islands methylation occur as well in cancer cells.<br />DNA methylation at CpG islands can silence tumor suppressor genes in cancer. Repetitive elements and intergenic regions are hypomethylated. Hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements can cause genomic instability and activation of genes that encodes noncoding RNAs.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Disruption of imprinting can also contribute to cancer. In normal cells, ICRs of the paternal alleles are methylated, and the methylation spreads to H19, so enhancers will act on Igf2 and Igf2 will be expressed. ICRS of the maternal alleles are unmethylated, so enhancers will act on H19 thus Igf2 will be silent.<br />In Wilm's tumor, ICRs of the maternal alleles are methylated as well, which causes double dose of expression of Igf2. And Igf2 is growth promoting, so the dose of it will promote tumorgenesis and will be found in preneoplastic tissues.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. It is now a mature medicine that has been approved by FDA. Decitabine is nucleoside analog and can be incorporated into DNA upon replication, so DNMT1 will bind with it irreversibly and cannot be released. Thus the DNA methylation levels will decrease in daughter cells.<br />Decitabine is cell-division-dependent, so cancer cells will be severely affected by Decitabine because they replicate more. And demethylation can help restore the function of tumor-suppressor genes.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNMT1 will help copy exactly the same methylation levels from mother cells to daughter cells and the following generations, so once DNA methylation is altered, the changes will be observed and cause enduring effects. Sensitive period is a term that means during which the epigenome is extremely easy to be altered and cause life-long changes. <br />During the development of humans, early embryonic development and primordial germ cell development are two sensitive periods. Patients are not advised to be treated epigenetically during sensitive periods for fear that the drug would affect the normal epigenetic reprogramming process and produce abnormal epigenetic marks, thus more complicated and severe results.</div>
