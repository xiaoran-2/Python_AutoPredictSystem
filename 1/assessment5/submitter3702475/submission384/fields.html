    <div class="field-value">In normal cells, CpG islands are usually not methylated, except when there is an active repression of the transcription of a gene due to imprinting or due to tissue specific gene expression. Epigenetic machinery, such as chromatin remodelers and specific methyl transferases, can overpack the DNA and lay repressive marks on histones after recognition of methylated CpG islands. In cancer cells, there is a general hypermethylation of CpG islands. Therefore, there is a downregulation (or disregulation) of imprinted genes, tissue specific genes and tumor suppressor genes. Decreased expression of tumor suppressor genes could lead to a cancer phenotype. <br />Methylation patterns in repetitive elements and intergenic regions are hypomethylated in cancer, compared to healthy cells. Normally, these elements are methylated to avoid them to jump in the genome and disrupt genes. However, in cancer cells, the hypomethylation of these elements unpack the chromatin and allow them to jump and therefore disrupt normal DNA sequences, which leads to genome instability. As these elements jump in the genome, they may insert into a tumor suppressor gene, generating a non functional gene. In the same way, they can insert into regulatory regions that can modify gene expression by either increasing expression of a oncogene or by decreasing the expression of tumor suppressor gene. Disruption of genes needed to keep chromosome structure could lead also to genome instability and therefore to cancer. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The H19/Igf2 cluster has an ICR, which is methylated in the paternal allele and unmethylated in the maternal allele. The protein CTCF binds to the maternal unmethylated ICR and insulates the upstream gene Igf2 from enhancers downstream, avoiding its transcription and favoring the transcrption of the gene H19, which is a lncRNA. In the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated, therefore CTCF doesn't bind and downstream enhancers can induce transcrption of Igf2 gene. In the paternal allele, the methylation in ICR induces methylation of regulatory regions of H19 and therefore there is silencing of this gene. Due to mutations or deletions, the maternal allele may behave like the paternal allele, which means an increase of the dosage of the oncogene Igf2. Additionally, a tumor suppressor gene (Cdkn1c) usually expresses from the maternal allele but not from the paternal allele gets silenced. People with this abnormalities may develop kidney tumors when during fetal and post-natal life, which is called Wilm's tumour, due to the overgrowth dictated by increased expression of oncogenes and decreased expression of tumor suppressor genes.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to a group of epigenetic drugs identified as DNA-demethylating drugs. It is a nucleotide analog that gets incorporated into the DNA during cell division and when DNMT complexes binds to it to copy the methylation in the daughter strand, there is a irreversible binding of DNMT to decitabine. Hence, the hypermethylation observed in cancer cells cannot be transmitted to daughter cells. Since cancer cells replicate at much higher speed than normal cells, the effect incorporation of decitabine into the DNA occurs mostly in cancer cells. However, all the cells undergoing cell division will incorporate decitabine to their DNA<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic marks are mitotically inherited. Therefore, if a tumour suppresor gene loses its methylation in the CpG island, it may become active again and decrease the replication rate of the tumour. This changes could be accomplished by drugs that alter DNA methylation. Drugs that modify the epigenetic patterns should be used on patients that are not passing by a sensitive period. Sensitive periods are embrionic development and production of gerline cells, in which the epigenetic marks get re-set moments that are not developing germline cells. If patients during sensitive periods are treated with epigenetic modificator drugs, they could present mistakes in the imprinting process as well as the silencing of genes that are tissue specific. Therefore, this could greatly harm the right epigenetic make up and gene expression. <br /></div>
