    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is an epigenetic silencing mark. In a normal cell, methylation is distributed as general hypermethylation at repeats, intergenetic regions and even introns, and as hypomethylation at CpGislands in promotor regions. This keeps promotors open and accessible to transcription, whereas repeats and intergenic regions are locked down in a silenced state as heterochromatin. In the transition from normal cell to cancer cell, many epigenetic and genetic aberrations occur in the genome. Genetic mutations as deletions, amplifications or point mutations can cause changes in the methylation status of the genome, if epigenetic machinery is affected. Further, epigenetic changes themselves lead to chromosomal instability and impaired DNA repair function, which also contributes to cancer development. <br />In general, cancer cells shift towards the opposite methylation pattern of a normal cell: Hypermethylation at promotor regions and generalised hypomethylation at the rest of the genome. This methylation pattern causes different effects, depending on which part of the genome is affected: If a CpG island at a promotor of a tumor supressor gene is hypermethylated, the gene will become silenced and loose its inhibitory effect and thereby contribute to cancer development. This is the case with the RB tumor suppressor gene, which is hypermethylated in retinoblastoma.<br />On the opposite hypomethylation at intergenic regions and at repeats contribute to tumorigenesis by leaving the chromatin more accessible to illegitimate recombination between repeat regions resulting in repeats, insertions and deletions. Hypomethylation also causes a higher degree of activation and transposition of these elements, as well as possible expression of cryptic promotors and effect on nearby genes: If an oncogene is amplified or suddenly can be driven by a cryptic promotor this adds to the disruption of normal cell function and the development of cancer. In this manner, methylation changes can be part of Knudson two-hit theory.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Another epigenetic change that often contributes to cancer development is the loss of imprinting. Imprinting describes the situation where an allele shows monoallelic parental specific expression and the other allele is silenced. As an example we can use the H19/Igf2 cluster: The maternal allele of this cluster is active in a non-methylated imprint control region (ICR) that recruits a CTCF complex. CTCF is an insulator protein, which act in cis on isolating the upstream growth promoting factor Igf2 from downstream enhancers that would preferably drive Igf2, if not CTCF was active. Instead CTCF renders the enhancers left to enhance only the expression of H19, a long non-coding RNA. On the contrary, the paternal allele is hypermethylated at the ICR, which blocks the recruitment of CTCF. As CTCF is not directing the enhancers, they are free to enhance the up-stream Igf2, which, as a result, is solely expressed from the paternal allele. In Wilms tumor, the cells in the kidney looses the paternal imprinting by the hypermethylation at ICR on the maternal allele. As the silencing of Igf2 is lost, and it is bi-allelic expressed, Igf2 generates a growth signal twice as high, which result in tumor formation.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Many new drugs are emerging with epigenetic marks or machinery as their target. Decitabine is one of the only FDA approved epigenetic drugs and is a nucleoside analogue, and an enzymatic inhibitor, that targets DNA methyl transferases 1 (DNMT1). It is used for myelodysplastic syndrome, as it progresses to a more malignant form. Decitabine blocks the mitotic heritability of methylation as it is built in to the nucleotide sequence during DNA replication as an ordinary nucleotide. However, when DNMT1 flows by to pass on the methylation marks from the maternal to the daughter DNA strand, it is irreversibly bound to Decitabine and unable to move on. This means that dividing cells are disrupted in passing on their hypermethylations at tumor suppressor gene promotors or ICR's. Fast dividing cells, as cancer cells, are affected the most; however, side effects on normal cells may also be substantial; only time will show.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable, so drugs affecting these marks will have permanent effects passed down from mother to daughter cell. During distinct periods in life, the genome is more vulnerable to factors influencing epigenetic state, than in others. Such periods are called sensitive periods and they are times, when all basic epigenetic modifications are erased and reset to the future pattern, except for the silencing marks of repeats regions. The two most important periods are right after fertilisation and during primordial cell development in the foetus; here the pluripotent stemcells are epigenetically marked for life. <br />Further, most of the childhood can be regarded as a semi-sensitive period as many tissues have not yet fully developed their epigenetic marks, and importantly female oocytes are kept in an epigenetic vulnerable state of meiosis until puberty. <br />This must be taken into regard when treating individuals with drugs targeted at epigenetic marks or machinery. The drugs affect all cells in the body, and drug induced alterations as side effects to treatment could be inherited as far as to grandchildren if primordial germ cells are affected. Therefore pregnancy should be avoided during such treatment, and likewise children should rarely be treated with epigenetic drugs.</div>
