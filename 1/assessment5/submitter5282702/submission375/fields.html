    <div class="field-value"><span>In a typical cell, CpG islands are unmethylated.
When present, methylation generally functions to silence the gene. In cancer,
an abnormal methylation of a tumor suppressor gene will silence the gene,
leaving an un-suppressed state, and a tumor will grow out of control. In this
way, hypermethylation or the overabundance of methylation can result in a
tumor.  Hypomethylation or the lack of
methylation can also result in cancer. Typically genome-wide, repeats and
intergenic regions are methylated. This methylation keeps the chromatin tightly
wound with the repeats and intergenic regions safely tucked inside. In this
way, methylation functions to improve and maintain the stability of the genome.
In the case of cancer, there is a genome-wide hypomethylation that causes
instability in the genome. Take the case of the repeats – without the
protection of the methylation and the tightly-packed chromatin, the repetitive
regions are free to match up with other repeats, thereby resulting in things
such as aberrant reciprocal translocations, activation of promoters resulting
in aberrant transcriptions, and insertions or deletions that cause abnormal
cells. Rodent models, in which there is a loss of methylation caused by a loss
of DNMT in a particular type of tissue, have shown that in the unmethylated
tissue type, cancer develops. This model is evidence that hypomethylation can
be a hallmark of cancer. Thus, in cancer, we find hypermethylation of the CpG
islands and shores of the tumor suppressor genes and a genome-wide
hypomethylation of the repeats and intergenic regions.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>In cancer, loss of imprinting can be a “hit”
such that gene function is dysregulated by a change in imprinted epigenetic
marks. For example, the paternal allele of the Igf2 gene is typically methylated
at the imprint control region. This methylation prevents the CTCF from binding
to the imprinted region, silences the H19 region, and allows the enhancers to
work on Igf2 region for expression of growth. In the maternal allele, the imprinted
region and the H19 region are unmethylated. This lack of methylation allows CTCF
insulation of the imprinted region, prevents the enhancers from working on the
Igf2 region, and thereby, disallows the growth. In Wilm’s tumor, the maternal
allele is hypermethylated resulting in Igf2 being expressed on both the
maternal and paternal alleles. This loss of imprinting results in overgrowth,
particularly of the Wilm’s tumor, which is a pediatric kidney cancer. In cancer
in general, losses of imprinting of this type are seen very early in tumorigenesis
and thus, may be a starting “hit” in some cancers. </span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to a class of enzymatic epigenetic
regulators, or more specifically epigenetic inhibitors, known as DNMTi, or DNA
methyltranferase inhibitors. The DNMTi drugs work by setting up the DNA to
irreversibly bind the DNMT and prevent its further activity. Decitabine mimics
a nucleoside such that during replication, it is incorporated into the
sequence. Then, when DNMT comes along, it is bound and can never be released,
which inhibits further methyl transfers. Because the action of decitabine
depends on replication, it has a profound effect on tumors since tumors
replicate very rapidly. Decitabine halts the methylation in replicating cells,
including tumor cells. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>DNA methylation is relatively stable in the
organism and can be passed on in each cell generation. Thus, any action that
alters DNA methylation will have an effect on all cells that result from
replication going forward. Importantly, there are sensitive periods in the
development of an individual during which the environment can profoundly affect
the developing organism. The environment can have an effect on development
during the primordial germ cell stage, during pre- and post-implantation
phases, and during the development of mature gametes, to name just a few
sensitive periods. These sensitive periods are times of epigenetic remodeling,
in particular. The epigenome is stripped and replaced (with some exceptions). We
need to be mindful that the use of these epigenetic-altering drugs affects
every cell in the body, including developing germ cells and gametes that may be
in the process of establishing a newly programmed epigenome. </span></div>
