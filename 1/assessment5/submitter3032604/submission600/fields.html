    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>It has been demonstrated that cancer is the result of the combination of genetic and epigenetic mistakes. Most common epigenetic mistakes involve changes in DNA methylation  i) at CpG islands and ii) in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.</div><div>Under normal conditions, CpG islands are hypomethylated. In contrast, CpG islands (areas that include many promoters)are hypermethylated in cancer. This leads to silencincing of genes, especially tumour suppressing genes, enabling the onset of cancer.</div><div>On the other hand, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated in normal conditions. However, these become hypomethylated in cancer. DNA hypomethylation results in chromatin unfolding and further genomic instability (deletions, insertions, reciprocal translocations) leading to cancer.</div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the paternal allele, the imprinting control region is methylated, therefore CTCF doesn't bind to the insulator element, and igf2 gene is expressed. In the maternal allele, CTFT binds to the insulator element and the enhancers will act on H19 ,therefore igf2 will remain silent. In cancer, and especially, in Wilm's tumour, there is loss of imprinting.In the maternal allele, there is hypermethylation of the imprinting control region, resulting in the expression of igf2. Therefore, in Wilm's tumour, there is a double dose of igf2 in the cell. As igf2 is a growth promoting factor, this overexpression leads to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. It acts as nucleoside analogue. Upon replication, decitabine is incorporated into the DNA and when DNA methyltransferase  comes to bind to the particular nucleoside in order to copy the methylation to the daughter strand, it becomes irreversibly bound  to DNA and it can no longer be released. Therefore decitabine acts as a DNA - demethylating agent. As decitabine action depends on cell  division , it will severely affect cells that are replicating rapidly, such as cancer cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">It has been demonstrated that- unlike genetic mutations- epigenetic abnormalities are reversible. By using a DNA-demethylating agent, DNA methylation becomes much lower and reaches that of a normal cell. The effects of the drug last beyond the period of drug treatment because the cells that have achieved the decrease of DNA methylation, after division, they will give cells with normal levels of DNA methylation (and no longer epigenetic abnormalities).<br />Sensitive period is a critical period of development,where impotant epigenetic marks are established. Sensitive period is germ cell development and gestation.Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable, because alteration in the epigenetic marks will be mitotically heredible and .irrevesible.</div>
