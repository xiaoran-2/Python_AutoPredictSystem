    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation of CpG islands, intergenic regions, and repetive elements is altered in cancer cells.   Promoter CpG islands are hypomethylated in normal cells; this results in the  expression of tumor suppressor genes that regulate cell growth.  In contrast, CpG islands in cancer cells are hypermethylated.  The hypermethylation of CpG islands silences tumor
suppressor genes and results in abnormal cell growth and cancer.  The intergenic regions and repetitive elements in normal cells are methylated, while in cancer cells they are hypomethylated.  The hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements seen in cancer cells leads to genomic instability via deletions, reciprocal translocations, insertions, and the activation of cryptic promoters.  This can disrupt the promotion and silencing of genes near these aberrations and contribute to cancer.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The H19/Igf2 cluster is paternally imprinted with the ICR on the paternal chromosome being methylated and the maternal ICR unmethylated.  On the maternal chromosome the unmethylated ICR is insulted by the protein CTCF, which blocks enhancers from activating the Igf2 promoter, limiting expression of maternal Igf2, and promoting expression of H19.  The methylation of the paternal ICR means that the methylation spreads to the H19 promoter, blocking the enhancers, and H19 is silenced.  The enhancers instead activate the Igf2 promoter and there is paternal Igf2 expression. When Igf2 imprinting is lost the maternal allele may be expressed in similarly to the paternal allele, resulting in the overexpresison of IGf2.   This overexpression leads to abnormal cell growth and cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes.  It works by hypomethylating DNA by blocking the binding of DNA methyltransferase in daughter cells during mitosis.  It is believed that this hypomethylation of the CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes stops or slows tumor growth as it is a reversal of the hypermethylation typically seen in these malignancies.  </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Broadly speaking, drugs that alter DNA methylation can have effects beyond the period of drug treatment because changes in methylation introduced during mitosis will be passed on during later rounds of mitosis.  Great caution should be exercised when considering using these drugs during sensitive periods - periods during which the epigenome is especially subject to alteration due to environmental factors.  These periods include early embryonic development, primordial germ cell development, perinatal and neonatal life, and early childhood.  Treating patients with drugs that alter DNA methylation during pregnancy or childhood is not advisable because we do not understand the long-term effects even on normal cells, and germ cells may especially be affected adversely.</div>
