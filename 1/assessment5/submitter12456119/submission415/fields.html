    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Generally in
the normal cells the CpG island are protected from methylation while the
intergenic region and the repetitive elements are methylated. In contrast, in
the cancer cell the CpG island are hypermethylated and the intergenic region
and repetitive elements are hypomethylated. In the normal cell the DNA
methylation are associated with silencing of the gene. Hence as the normal
tissue turns into cancer cells (invasion) the methylayion at the CpG island
increases. Hence the hypermethylation at CpG island silence the tumour
suppressor genes incancer.  The
intergenic regions and repetitive elements  maintains the genomic integrity and genomic
stability. By being methylated, it prevents the illegitimate recombination
between the repeats, transposition and also interference from the promoters.  When the regions become hypomethylation, the
intergenic regions and repetitive elements are no longer silence, hence there
will be legitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and
transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring
genes. <br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele, the imprinted control regions (ICR)
is methylated while it is unmethylated in maternal alleles.  The methylated ICR prevents the binding of
CTCF and it allows the enhancers to promote the expression of the Igf2 on the
paternal allele. The H19 is not expressed on the paternal allele because DNA
methylation silences the promoter. In contrast, the unmethylated ICR allows the
CTCT to bound and H19 is expressed. The CTCF in an insulator proteins and it
insulates the Igf2 from the downstream enhancers. This allows the enhancers act
on H19 and enhance the expression of H19 on the maternal allele. In short a
normal cell has unmethylated ICR on maternal allele and methylated ICR on the
paternal allele. However, in the Wilm’s tumor cell, both the paternal and
maternal allele has hypermethylated ICR. This causes the expression of the Igf2
to be more in the cell and there is no expression of the H19.  The Igf2 is the growth factor for the cells
and hence the increase in the expression of the Igf2 leads to the Wilm’s
tumour. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The Decitabine is DNA demethylation reagents and
classified as DNA methlytransferase inhibitors (Kantarjian H &amp; et al) <span> The Decitabine hypomethylates the DNA and

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effecrs on the
epigenome because the changes are passed on from one generation to another
generation as long as the epigenetics mark are not reprogrammed or erased. By
giving the drugs that alter the functions, it could cause great impact during
the sensitive period. Sensitive period is the time where the epigenetics reprogramming
takes place. The major sensitive period is during gametogenesis and during
preimplantation development.  It is
inadvisable to treat the patient (pregnant mother) with these treatments as
sensitive period occurs during child development and also during the
gametogenesis as mentioned. Hence, this would affect the forming foetus genes. </p>
