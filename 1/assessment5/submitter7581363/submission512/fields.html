    <h1>Submission 512 from Anon (session_user_id: 04043b2c15ddf04a7afe1130b6680ec518b1146c)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Methyltransferases
are enzimes that attaches methyl groups to histone proteins, in general
lymphomas are caused by mutations that make methyltransferases overactive, and
such overactivity methylates histones more than they should be and this
silences the genes they surround, included tumor suppressor genes whose job is
to stop the uncontrolled cell growth that causes cancer. In cases like that, drugs
like Decitabine (sold by Eisai, a Japanese company) which is a DNA
demethylating agent that hypometilates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferases
activity and as a consequence it stops cancer growing too. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation
occurs normally in many sites in the genome like in intergenic regions or in
repetitive elements, this has many functions, probably this is mainly to
maintain genomic integrity; for example the silencing of repeats can prevent
transposition and avoid transcription interference from strong promoters and
methylation of repeats may prevent illegitimate recombination. But there are
other regions of the genome that normally are unmethylated like CpG islands which
are promoter regions, their methylation is mutagenic and is related with
silence of tumor suppressor genes in cancer, the opposite happens with
intergenic regions and repetitive elements because when they are hypo
methylated can cause genomic instability.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The paternally expressed lncRNA AIR is involved in imprinting processes,
this is required for silencing the maternally expressed protein-coding gene
Igf2r among others, <span>and inhibits expression by
targeting the H3K9 histone methyltransferase G9a to the Slc22a3 promoter<span> </span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Epigenetic changes are
passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they
are actively erased or at least that’s the case in DNA methylation that is
inherited even through generations. When a drug is used in cancer treatment it erase
this epigenetic marks and is unlikely that they return, those epigenetic
therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill
all its cells, but the drugs are used through the system and every cell in the
organism has the potential to be affected by them, there are sensitive periods
in the development of an individual when there are active reprograming in
cells, it means that there’s a removal and laying down of epigenetic marks in
the genome, that’s the case of young patients where they have germ cell
development and those cells can be affected, there’s not enough information
about, but I think it could lead potentially to fertility issues and epigenetic
diseases in their future child if they want to have them, that’s one the reasons
why the applying of this kind of treatment needs to be analyzed in each case
and decide if this is pertinent to use. </span></div>
