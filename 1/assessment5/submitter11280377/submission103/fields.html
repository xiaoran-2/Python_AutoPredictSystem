    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation occurs in approximately 70 to 80% of CpG dinucleotides in normal somatic mammalian cells, but is also present in other sequences in embryonic stem cells. In any case, methylation ussually correlates with gene silencing and has a key role in several epigenetic processes such as imprinting, heterochromatin formation or X chromosome inactivation. On the other hand, CpG islands found in roughly 60% of promoters usually remain unmethylated despite their high CpG density and regardless their functional status. In cancer, however, CpG islands hypermethylation takes place and it leads to silencing of tumor suppressor genes responsible for cell cycle regulation, apoptosis and DNA repair. This could finally result in cell rapid division and tumor growth.<br /><br />Furthermore, intergenic methylation occurs mostly in repetitive sequences, where it is supposed to avoid transcriptional disruption from alternative start sites, repress antisense transcription and RNA splicing. Moreover, specific methylation patterns in intergenic regions is related to lineage-specific activation or deactivation of certain transcription factors binding sites and modulation of other distal regulatory elements. The disruption of said methylation patterns by genome-wide hypomethylation in can alter gene expression and chromatin structure and cause genomic instability and replication errors, which could finally disrupt cell cycle regulation, cell replication rate or extracellular matrix remodelling, all of them abnormalities which may lead to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the H19/Igf2 cluster, the paternal allele is usually methylated at the ICR while the maternal allele remains unmethylated. Then, CTCF insulator complex binds to its site in the maternal allele and H19 transcription is enhanced, though Igf2 is insulated from downstream enhancers. On the other hand, CTCF ccomplex does not bind to the paternal allele due to methylation leading to gene silencing of H19 and enhanced expression of Igf2. <br /><br />However, when the ICR becomes hypermethylated, both strands seem to have paternal origin, thus leading to Igf2 (oncogene which favours cell growth) overexpression and H19 silencing, which is associated with Wilm's tumor.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is an epigenetic inhibitor which belongs to the group of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, therefore contributing to DNA hypomethylation. This allows Decitabine to exert an anti-tumor effect, as it is involved in the reactivation of silenced tumor suppressor genes via hypomethylation.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation s a very powerful form of epigenetic regulation, as its effect last even after the treatment has come to an end. That is because the DNA methylation enzymes maintain these marks during cell division. However, these modifications may negatively affect systemic functions during specially sensitive periods, such as fetal development and preconception, as epigenetic reprogramming takes place during these early development stages and also during gametes formation.</div>
