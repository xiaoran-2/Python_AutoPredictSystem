    <div class="field-value">In general, DNA methylation is associated with gene silencing. In a normal cell, the DNA that is methylated includes repetitive elements, intergenic regions, structural parts of the DNA and the ICRs of imprinted genes. It is necessary to keep repetitive elements silenced in general to prevent major disruptions to the genome. This is important in intergenic regions as well. Note that methylation of an ICR does not always lead to gene silencing, and that only 1 ICR in a pair of genes will be methylated, either the maternal or paternal allele, depending on imprinting. In cancer, there is a global hypomethylation of the genome, including the repetitive elements. This is the earliest epigenetic abnormality identified in cancer cells. Hypomethylation of the repetitive elements allows them to be expressed and disrupt the genome by transpositions, recombinations, activating cryptic promoters, and generally causing genomic instability. This genomic instability can lead to mutations and epimutations that silence tumor suppressor genes and activate oncogenes, leading to cancer.<br /> CpG islands (CGIs) are places on the genome rich in cysteine-guanine residues. Cystine is the base that gets methylated. In a normal cell, CGIs tend to NOT be methylated, especially at the promoters of genes. In cancer, hypermethylation of CGIs occurs in opposition to the global hypomethylation. One way for tumor suppressor genes to be silenced epigenetically is to hypermethylate the CGIs associated with them. Not only do the CGIs get hypermethylated in cancer, but the regions up to 2 kb around CGIs will be hypermethylated and silenced as well.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprinted genes are those that have epigenetic marks that result in parent-of-origin specific monoallelic gene expression. Imprinting is established in primordial germ cells epigenetically by DNA methylation of the Imprint Control Region(ICR) of either the paternal or maternal allele. The ICR then controls gene expression in a cluster of imprinted genes.<br />In the case of the H19/Igf2 cluster, for example, which is paternally imprinted, the unmethylated maternal ICR can be bound by CTCF, which is an insulator protein. CTCF binding stops Igf2 expression, which would otherwise be activated by the expression of downstream enhancers. The enhancers promote H19 expression instead. H19 is a long noncoding RNA. The paternal ICR cannot bind CTCF because it is methylated. This allows the enhancers to promote Igf2 expression from the paternal allele only. Igf2 is a growth factor, so this dose compensation mechanism is very important.<br />Hypermethylation of the maternal ICR of this imprinted gene cluster can cause a specific kind of cancer- Wilm's tumor. A methylated maternal ICR will behave like the paternal ICR, preventing CTCF binding and allowing Igf2 expresion. The double dose of Igf2 contributes to this specific childhood cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA demethylator, according to the article. It is a DNMT inhibitor, it blocks the actions of de novo methyl transferases. This means it will reduce DNA methylation in a cancer cell. It does this by binding to DNMTs irreversibly after being incorporated into the DNA during replication, because they are nucleoside analogs. We know that in cancer, DNA methylation is one way in which tumor suppressor genes can be silenced. Using this drug would prevent methylation as neoplastic cells rapidly replicate. The article states that these drugs are only being used to treat myelodysplastic disorders before they progress to AML (acute myelogenous luekemia). Possibly this is because it allows the expression of tumor suppressor genes and the cells are able to stop being neoplastic.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Sensitive periods in the epigenetic sense are those in which the epigenetic state is vulnerable to alteration because the marks are being reset. These times are in early embryonic development and during primordial germ cell(PGC) development. PGCs have sensitive periods during embryonic development and at several other times in the lifetime of an organism as gametes are developed and matured. The other sensitive periods are cell lineage specific, as there is active remodelling of epigenetic marks during differentiation into various terminally differentiated somatic cell lines.<br /><br />DNA methylation is one of the most important epigenetic marks. It is mitotically heritable via de novo methyltransferases (DNMTs), which insure that all daughter cells have DNA methylated the same as the parent cell DNA. Suppressing DNMT action, which is essentially what occurs when using DNMT inhibitory drugs in the treatment of cancer, can prevent mitotic inheritance of DNA methylation in PGCs or in embryonic cells, if given while such cells are laying down and transmitting epigenetic marks. This could cause alterations in the eipgenome for the lifetime of the organism, because the DNA methylation would then be faithfully repeated at every cell division. <br /><br />This means caution with pregnant women and children.<br /></div>
