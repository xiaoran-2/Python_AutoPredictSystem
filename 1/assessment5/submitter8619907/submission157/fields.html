    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at CpG sites is a basis for such epigenomic mechanism as imprinting, contributing, for example, to different methylation patterns in different tissues. CpG sequences tend to be methylated but in promoter regions they are normally being kept unmethylated because CpG islands methylation in gene promoter regions is associated with silencing of a downstream gene thus affecting the expression pattern. In cancer, DNA methylation pattern is frequently altered in cancer: CpG islands in promoter regions are hypermethylated for tumor supressor genes and hypomethylated for oncogenes which results in tumor supressors silencing and oncogenes overexpression which leads to establishing pro-survival signals within the cell. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements such as satellite repeats and retroviral remnants are normally highly methylated and associated with repressive histone marks which indicates that these elements are being kept in an inactive state. In cancer, in contrast these elements are being less methylated which may lead to their re-activation, genomic instability and cancer progression.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">H19 is a long non-coding RNA which shares common enhancers with Igf2 and contributes to its expression regulation. Paternal allele has methylation marks in H19 promoter (resulting in H19 silencing) and in imprint control region (ICR) which disrupts binding of CTCF to ICR allowing distant enhancer elements to promote Igf2 expression. This results in Igf2 expression from paternal allele. Maternal allele lacks all these methylation marks. Thus, H19 promotor and ICR are not methylated, CTCF can bind to maternal ICR preventing distant enhancers from promoting Igf2 expression but acting on H19 instead which results in Igf2 repression and H19 expression from maternal allele. Thus, loss of H19 leads to Igf2 overexpression and overgrowth and H19 overexpression from both paternal and maternal alleles resulting in Igf2 suppression is lethal. In cases of Wilm's tumor (nephroblastoma) loss of imprinting usually occurs which results in aberrant methylation of maternal allele of H19/Igf2 cluster leading to H19 expression supression and Igf2 overexpression promoting cell growth. This mechanism can also contribute to other types of cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. It has a hypomethylating effect on DNA due to inhibiting an enzyme responsible for DNA methylation and thus it prevents methylation of the de novo synthesized DNA strand. Because various tumor supressor genes are being silenced due to excessive methylation of their promoter regions in cancer, decitabine treatment may lead to decrease in overall DNA methylation and also tumor supressor promoters which potentially might restore their expression level and result into anti-tumor effect.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altered DNA methylation marks are passed on to the cell's progeny during multiply cell divisions until they are been actively reset. Changes in DNA methylation due to drug treatment in this particular example might restore the expression of various tumor suppresor genes like p53 and make tumor cells more sensitive to DNA damaging agents. Sensitive period in terms of epigenetics is a period when epigenetic marks are being actively removed and set de novo. One such period is an early embryonal development which makes treatment of pregnant women with such drugs inadvisable due to possible detrimental effect on a child. Another sensitive period is resetting epigenetic marks during gametogenesis. In females it occurs as early as during their embryonal development. In males spermatogenesis occurs during the lifetime so it is highly inadvisable to conceive a child after a man was treated until the effect of a drug is mitigated.</div>
