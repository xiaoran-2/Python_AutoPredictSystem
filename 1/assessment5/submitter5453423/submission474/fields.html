    <div class="field-value"><p>
In
cancer cells the methylation patterns are generally reversed with
CpG-islands being hypermethylated with a genome-wide hypo-methylation
at the same time, so intergenic regions and repetitive elements are
less methylated than in a normal cell with some methylation.</p>
<p>
Hypermethylation
of CpG-islands differ by cancer type and a so-called CIMPs
(CpG-island methylation phenotype) have been described for various
cancer types, including colorectal cancer, gliomas and neuroblastoma.</p>
<p>
Altered
CpG-methylation contributes to cancer as CpG-islands are often
associated with the start of genes, ie. promoter regions, and thus
influence the expression and silencing of genes.</p>
<p>
Some
tumours are in this way driven by tumour suppressor hypermethylation,
as the CpG-methylation in these cases inactivates the genes
responsible for suppression for instance by letting the cell die or
undergo apoptosis. This does not happen when these suppressor genes
are silenced. The effect of altered methylation can be stage specific
though, ie. depending on the developmental of the tumour.</p>
<p>
<span>The
genome-wide hypomethylation of both intergenic regions and repetitive
elements contributes to cancer as the methylation state plays a role
in genomic stability and so disturbances lead to chromosomal
instability in the form of illegitimate recombination between
repeats, activation of repeats and transposition among others. So in
this case the depletion of methylation enhance tumorigenesis.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>
Wilm's
tumour is an embryonic kidney cancer.</p>
<p>
The
methylation pattern of the paternal allele is different from the
maternal allelel as several sites before H19 are methylated on the
paternal allele. This result in IGF2 being expressed while H19 is
almost fully silenced on the paternal allele.</p>
<p>
In
the maternal allele these same sites upstream of H19 are not
methylated, so the noncoding RNA H19 is expressed instead of IGF2. In
Wilm's tumors the maternal chromosome therefore acts as a paternal
epigenotype with a paternal methylation pattern of the H19 promoter.</p>
<p>
This
results in IGF2 turned on in both the paternal and maternal alleles
and H19 turned off. 
</p>
<p>
<span>Because
H19 slows cell growth and IGF2 stimulates cell growth (it is short
for Insulin-like Growth Factor 2) the overall result is increased
cell growth, that is tumour formation.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>
Decitabine
is a DNA-demethylating agent used for treating myelodysplastic
syndromes, a precursor for acute myelogenous leukemia.</p>
<p>
<span>Different
cancer tumours have different dependencies. Some are driven by tumour
supressor hypermethylation and depletion of methylation by using this
drug can possibly suppress tumorigenesis.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>
A
sensitive period is characterised by reprogramming of DNA methylation
patterns which primarily happens in two situations during embryonal
development. First, after fertilization during pre-implantation
development until gastrulation and second, during primordial germ
cell development; ie. gametogenesis.</p>
<p>
Active
remodelling of epigenetic marks also happens eg. when blood stem
cells make different types of T-cells; ie. a differentiation specific
demethylation in hematopoietic progenitors.</p>
<p>
Treating
patients during these sensitive periods would be inadvisable as this
can evidently disturb the epigenetic reprogramming. It is
hypothesized that this can happen when using assisted reproductive
technologies, for instance superovulation, that is, drug-induced
production of multiple eggs for use in IVF / ICSI. Because humans are
not tolerant of genome-wide epigenetic abnormalities embryos with
these defects do in most cases not survive. 
</p>
<p>Based on my limited knowledge from this course, I
would not treat patients during these periods with drugs such as
decitabine as disturbances in methylation patterns in, eg. imprint
control regions can result in various syndromes, eg.
Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.</p>
<p>
Altered
DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome beyond the
period of drug treatment because methylation patterns for instance
decide mitotically inheritable tissue-specific differentiation and,
more generally, which genes are transcribed.
