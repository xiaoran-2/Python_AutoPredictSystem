    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA
methylation occurs as a result of the cytosine base modification at C5 position
(5mC). In a normal situation, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are
usually methylated. DNA methylation of promote regions is associated with gene expression
decrease. However,  at CpG islands, which
are found in about 60% of promoters, the levels of DNA methylation are usually
low.</p><p>In cancer,
due to both genetic and epigenetic abnormalities, CpG islands became
hypermethylated while a genome-wide lack of methylation by hypomethylation of
both intergenic regions and repeats is reported. This leads to genomic
instability by deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes. Moreover,
it also causes activation of oncogenes promoters and silence promoters of tumour suppressor genes. Cancer
cells are hence in a continuous process of division and due to the inheritance
of DNA methylation, epigenetic marks of cancer cells can pass through cell
division resulting in a neoplasia and lastly causing invasion. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the
H19/Igf2 cluster, the imprinted control region is unmethylated in the maternal
allele and is methylated in the paternal allele, which means that this cluster
is paternally imprinted. Further, several sites upstream of H19 are methylated
in parental allele, in constrate by maternal allele.</p>

<p>On the
maternal allele, the insulin protein CTCF insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers,
which are free to loop to H19 and enhance the H19 expression on the maternal
allele. On the paternal allele, CTCF cannot bind to the methylated imprinted
control region. With no insulator action, the enhancers are indeed free to act
on Igf2 and promote its expression.</p>

<p>Hence, the
long non coding RNA H19 is only maternally produced while lgf2 in only paternally
produced.</p>

<p>Wilm’s
tumour is characterized by imprinting loss and Igf2 overexpression. In fact, due
to hypermethylation of imprinted control region on maternal allele as well,
Igf2 became to be expressed in both paternal and maternal alleles. As Igf2 is a growth promoting, the
double dose of this protein compared to normal cells is associated to nearly
tumourgenesis by increased cell growth which contributes to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an epigenetic inhibitor that belongs to DNA-demethylation
agents. Hence, Decitabine hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltrasnferase
and can only be incorporated in DNA strands. As a result, Decitabine shows an
anti-tumoural effect by reducing methylation of the promoters of tumour-supressor
genes, which can became express to reduce cancer effects, and is actually used in treatment of
myelodysplastic syndrome. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>By using drugs
that alter DNA methylation, tissues can temporary preserve that epigenetic
modifications after treatment due to the mitotically inheritance of DNA methylation, until they are actively erased during successive cell divisions. Hence, the patients became more susceptible to
standard chemotherapy as epigenetic DNA methylation marks of cancer cells are
not reestablished yet. DNA methylation seems to be a promissive therapy  approach in
patients and a reversible process, in contrast to genetic modifications. Moreover, hypermethylated promoters may serve as biomarkers. </p>

<p>A sensitive period is a moment when the environment can influence
epigenetic makeup of the organism. There are two major periods that are more sensitive
to epigenetic control. The first one is the period of primordial germ cell development
and all way through the production of mature eggs and sperm. The second period
is the embryo pre-implantation and early post-implantation period. Both periods are characterized by active remodeling of the epigenome, with
removal and laid down of epigenetic marks at different places in the genome. Hence,
treatments during pregnancy would be inadvisable as not only the patient is
exposed to drug effects but also the embryo, particularly during the initial
stage of development and primordial cells development period.</p></div>
