    <h1>Submission 104 from Anon (session_user_id: 267b3ac62cb4c2d3587d2d85e6aca18d0be3e35e)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">As it was said in The Economist article, Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, that means that it will eliminate DNA methylation marks (those makes the region inactive for transcription). <br />Those marks are present all over the genome, specially in repetitive elements, CpG islands, and gene and intergene regions. <br />In the case of cancer, one effect observed in a lot of types of cancers is the locus specific DNA hypermethylation, in CpG islands and CpG island shores of tumour
suppressor genes. That hypermethylation makes the gene inactive, and so, being a tumor supressor inactive will lead probably to the formation of cancer. <br />By eliminating that abnormal excess of DNA methylation, Decitabine is able to restore the normal amount of DNA methylation in tumor supressor genes, and so, to stop cancer progression. <span><br /></span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>DNA methylation at CpG islands:<br />In a normal cell, </span>CpG islands and CpG island shores of tumour
suppressor genes are not methylated, as tumor supressors need to be active to maintain the normal cell proliferation and behavior conditions. However, in cancer it is usually observed that tumor supressors are silenced, but not due to mutations, it is caused by a hypermethylation of their CpG islands or CpG island shores. The hypermethylation will mean that the tumor supressor gene won't be transcribed, and so it won't carry out its function of stoping tumor formation, and that's what will happen probably.<br />It can also happen in CpG poor promoters an oncogene activation, but this time due to genome-wide hypomethylation. The effect will be the contrary, activation of an oncogene that should be inactive (in a normal cell the promoter is methylated).<br /><span><br />DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements:<br /></span>In a normal cell, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated, in order to avoid genomic instability. If those regions are not methylated, due to the genome-wide hypomethylation usually observed in cancer, genome instability will occur: illegitimate recombination between repeats can happen, as well as their activation and transposition along the genome, and it can also lead to the activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to
neighbouring genes. That may generate subsequent genetic alterations or mutations and transcription of genes that should be inactive, that will make cell abnormalities even worse, and lead to cancer formation.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The paternal allele has the ICR region methylated, that blocks the binding of CTCF. CTCF is an insulator protein, it insulates Igf2 from downstream
enhancers. If CTCF is not able to bind, as happens in the paternal allele, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter and so silences it. Then enhancers can access Igf2 gene and activate it.<br />In the maternal allele, the IRC region is not methylated, and so CTCF can bind it. Then DNA methylation won't spread to H19 promoter, and the gene will be inactive. That will determine that Igf2 gene won't be activated by the enhancers.<br />In Wilm's tumor, an alterations of DNA methylation at ICRs occurs, in this case an hypermethylation in the maternal allele, in a way that it will behave as the paternal allele (ICR region methylated, so binding of CTCF, DNA methylation spreading to H19 promoter and enhancers can access Igf2 gene and activate it), so it will end with an overexpression of Igf2 gene. This gene is a growth factor, that if overexpressed, will lead to an abnormal proliferation, and so, probably to cancer formation.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic changes are maintained through generations (during cell division) unless or until they are actively erased, and then they won't be restored unless or until a new process of epigentic marks formation is carried out. The active erasement of epigenetic changes can be generated in cancer cells with specific drugs, and all the descendant cells will have the erasement and won't restore those marks easily, that is why it can be very effective.<br />However, during sensitive periods that can be very dangerous. Sensitive period is the one in which epigenetic changes are being carried out (marks resetting), when the environment change may have an effect on epigenetic control.<br />Those sensitive periods are when gametes are being formed and during first steps of development (until epiblast step). In those periods (gametes formation and pregnant women) patients should be advice from taking the treatment, as they are not going to affect themselves, but yes their offspring (children and even grandchildren). That is due to the fact that the DNA methylation marks are being resetted at that time (they are erased and then generated again). The erasement should be even easier, but new marks won't be formed because of the treatment.</div>
