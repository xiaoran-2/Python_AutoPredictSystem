    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are located at promoter regions of certain genes. These regions tend to be unmethylated no matter its transcriptional activity, but methylation of these regions correlates with gene silencing. In cancer cells is more likely to found these regions in a hyperrmethylated state. If the hyperrmethylation of CpG island is produced at promoter region of a supressor tumor gene, this would be silenced, promoving the tumor grothw. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated in healthy cells. This ensure a compacting form of the DNA , preventing recombination, transposition  , deletions, transcription from criptic promoters and other phenomenon that could produce alterations on the cell. In Cancer cells we found these intergenic regions and repetitive elements hypomethylated, thus, these regions adquire a lower compaction of DNA, so they become active producing genome inestability . That could disrupt some cell´s mechanism responsible of maintain a normal grothw state . In other word events of recombination , translocations and other DNA damages due to genome inestability could cause cancer.  </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demetylating agent. It is a cytosine analogue so it´s incorporated to DNA and disrupts DNA methylation, inhibiting DNA Methyl transferase. That results in a hypomethylation of DNA. Its anti-tumour effect could reside in the fact that some promoter regions of supressor tumour genes are hypermethylated. This drugs could reverse the methylation state of these promoter regions, and reactivate this genes stopping tumour growth. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">An adventage of epigenetics modifications in a clinical point of view is they are reversible. The epigenetics modifications are mitotically heritable, that means, they passes on cell to cell during cell division. For this reason any change on the epigenome of a cell is transmitted to its offspring. So this drugs could produce some modifications on the epigenome,thus the cells product of cell division could be more susceptible to standard chemotherapy. We know during development there are some periods where a reprogramming of the epigenome is done, thus the epigenetics marks are removed and then reestablish again. These times are known as sensitive periods. Early stages of development and primordial germ cell development are sensitive periods, because of epigenetics marks are erased and restore. If patients are treated during some of these periods, or for example in the childhood or early adulthood, this changes of the epigenome could affect sperm cells, and produce aberrant offspring. The main is  reason the drug would modify the epigenome in a crucial period provoquing serious defects on the development.    </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">H19/Igf2 Cluster is an example of imprinted genes. This cluster is paternally imprinted. The paternal allele is methylated at the ICR . When ICR is methylated the  CTCF protein can not bind to it and this fact enables the enhancer region of the cluster to interact with Igf2 gene and become it transcriptionally active. In the other hand, at the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated, so  CTCF protein can bind to ICR,and acts like insulator avoiding the interaction between the enhancer region and Igf2 gene. An alternative loop is formed, and the enhancer region interact with H19 , making possible its transcription. In Wilm´s tumour we found a maternal allele reverses to a paternal epigenotype, that means the two alleles present methylation at the ICR, so two copies of Igf2 is being expressed and none of H19. Igf2 is an oncogen,its function is promoves the cell proliferation of certain types of tissues,  so when the gene dosage is double , that promotes a cell overgrothw , </div>
