    <h1>Submission 75 from Anon (session_user_id: f65ded669243afb1d902f163cb63dea44b94fadb)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">There are several theraputic drugs that are available or in development to target epigenetic processes.  And example is Decitabine which belongs to the DNA Methyl Transferase Inhibitors (DNMTi) class of epigenetic inhibitors.  The molecule in Decitabine gets incorporated into the DNA at the binding site for DNA Methyl Transferase and then when DNMT binds it is irreversible.  This prevents methylation from being copied to the daughter DNA strand, so methylation is dimished with each cell division.  Cancer cells replicate more rapidly so are more severely impacted by this drug than normal cells.  By diminishing the abnormal methylation at CpG islands, tumor suppressor genes are no longer silenced which helps slow cancer development.  This particular treatment is most effective for cancers of the blood, which are known to have hypermethylation of CpG islands that impact tumor suppressor genes.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value">In cancer there is hypermethylation of CpG islands, while overall genome wide methylation levels become hypomethylated.  <br /><br />Normally CpG islands aren't methylated (in general), so that the nearby genes are able to be expressed.  But In tumors  there is hypermethylation of CpG islands.   The specific hypermethylation profile (i.e., the specific Cpg islands and related genes that are silenced) is unique within each tumor subtype.  CpG hypermethylation contributes to cancer because CpG islands are often found near tumor suppressor genes, so if these become methylated these genes don't express.  When this happens, tumor suppressive proteins aren't produced and cancer can more easily take hold.  <br /><br />The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to silence expression in these regions.  But in cancer, these areas become hypomethylated (i.e., they lose their methylation), leading to expression of especially repetitive elements that are normally silenced.  The specific intetergenic area or repetitive element that is hypomethylated varies by the type of tumor, but the presence of hypomethylation in these areas is universal in all studied cancer cells.  Hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements leads to genetic instability which includes activation of repeats and cryptic promoters, transposition, erronious recombination of repeats, and disruption of neighboring genes.  This results in insertions, deletions, and incorrect recombination of genetic material.  There is quite a lot of evidence in human cancers that this type of genetic instability is a characteristic feature.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In cancer cells it is also common to see loss of imprinting.  That is, cells that should be expressing mono-allelic parent-of-origin expression lose this pattern through either hyper or hypo methlation of the imprint control regions (ICRs).  Many imprinted genes are involved with growth mechanisms, which is why disruption of these imprinted genes can contribute to cancer.  <br /><br />An example is the H19/Igf2 cluster.  In this case, the ICR of the paternal allele is normally methylated which allows enhancers to act on Igf2, leading to expression of Igf2.  In the maternal allele, on the other hand, the ICR should normally be unmethylated - this allows the CTCF protein to bind to the ICR, which prevents the Enhancers from activating Igf2.  Instead, the enhancers act on H19, which is a suppressor of growth hormone.  In Wilm's tumour, the maternal allele becomes methylated, so CTCF is unable to bind, and therefore Igf2 isn't buffered from the enhancers.  This leads to double expression of Igf2 growth, and no offsetting suppression from H19.  This overexpression of growth promotion allows the cancer cells to grow uncontrolled.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation with drugs can have enduring effects on the epigenome, particularly if the alteration takes place during sensitive periods when the cell is most vulnerable to epigenetic changes.  A sensitive period is one where epigenetic reprogramming is occurring within in the cell.  Sensitive periods include early development of the embryo (e.g. during blastocyst/stem cell stage) and also primordial germ cell development.  Treating patients with epigenetic drugs during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because it could impact the epigentic reprogramming that is taking place during those periods.  This could have lasting effects on epigenetic patterns impacting gene expression throughout the patient's lifetime.</div>
