    <div class="field-value">CpG islands in normal cells are generally hypomethylated, which is important for regulatory regions of many genes. In cancer cells, they are generally hypermethylated, and this is unique to each of the particular tumour subtypes, which allows them to be used as tumour markers for diagnosis,prognosis of disease and option of treatment type. CpG island hypermethylation also increases as the tumour progresses, e.g. BRCA1 in breast cancer. It is mostly in promoter regions of tumour suppressor genes which inactivates them, leading to transcriptional silencing, and this is an effective way as it is mitotically heritable.  Due to this suppression, the cancer cell can divide more rapidly and avoid cell death and, potentially, can take over. This forms a part of the hits in the Knudson Hypothesis and the multiple hits are thought to eventually lead to cancer.<br /><br />Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are generally hypermethylated in normal cells and DNA methylation is important in maintaining genomic stability to prevent loss or gain of chromosomes and illegitimate recombinations between genes that should not normally occur. In cancer cells, these intergenic and repetitive elements are found to be generally hypomethylated. In this case, repeats may align with unrelated chromosomes or areas in the genome that they do not normally align with and recombination may occur, due to the loss of methylation or their heterochromatin compacted state leaving them open to undergo illegitimate reciprocal translocation, deletions and insertions. This, along with activation of repeats due to hypomethylation which allows them to make copies of themselves and transpose along the genome where they may disrupt coding regions or activate cryptic promoters and neighbouring genes, leads to genomic instability and abnormal karyotypes in cancer cells. This is seen in DNMT3B mutations in ICF syndrome.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprinting disruption occurs in cancer as many imprinted genes are involved in growth (promotion or suppression). <br />In a normal cell, the paternal allele, where the imprint control region (ICR) is methylated, CTCF is silenced and the enhancers will bind to Igf2, allowing its expression. Therefore Igf2 is expressed from the paternal allele. In the maternal allele,where the ICR is unmethylated, CTCF binds the insulator element, leading to binding of the enhancers to H19 and acting on it. Igf2 is silent and will not be expressed.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumour, there is loss of imprinting due to hypermethylation of the imprint control region on the maternal allele region as well, and Igf2 is then also expressed from both the paternal and maternal alleles due to binding of enhancers to Igf2 in both alleles. This double dosed over expression of Igf2 (insulin-like growth factor 2), which is a growth promoter, and reduced expression of H19 (which is a growth suppressor and has a role in limiting cell proliferation)  leads to increased cell growth and the formation of cancer and is associated with Wilm's tumour, which is a childhood kidney tumour.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent that is used to treat myelodysplatic syndrome, which is a precursor of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). It is DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) and is a nucleoside analogue that irreversibly binds DNMTs and is replication dependent. The mechanism of action is unclear, however, this makes rapidly dividing cells such as cancer cells more susceptible to it. In lower doses it leads to effective DNA demethylation in the rapidly dividing cancer cells, targeting heavy CpG island hypermethylation areas making them more effective for haematological malignancies. When it binds with DNA methyltrasnferases it prevents DNA synthesis and subsequent cytotoxicity. However, they may have unknown effects on normal cells as well.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation alteration having enduring effects on the epigenome is possibly due to their mitotic heritability, as these changes are passed on to the daughter , and grand-daughter, cells. Therefore, the effects last past the period of drug treatment.<br />Sensitive periods are periods when altered environments have an effect on epigenetic control and make up.These sensitive periods are periods of primordial cell development up to production of mature eggs and sperm, as well as the period of preimplantation and early post-implantation. In young children it also includes the periods of germ cell development. There are also tissue-specific sensitive periods during which specific tissues are sensitive to environmental effects. <br />Treating patients during these periods would be inadvisable or needs care as these drugs potentially affect all cells and have system-wide effects, not just targeted tissues. Sensitive periods are ones during which there is germ cell development, active remodelling of the epigenome , and removal and laying down of epigenetic marks throughout the genome, making them sensitive to changes in the environment. Use of these drugs has an effect of inhibiting the epigenetic machinery which may have a profound insult on the genome when used during these periods.</div>
