    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>The alteration of DNA methylation, which leads to cancer occurrence, mainly divided into several components. They are the alterations in the DNA methylation of CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements.</li>
</ul><p><br /></p>
<ul><li>Firstly, the alteration in CpG islands. The CpG sites are regions of DNA with linear sequence of cytosine nucleotide and followed guanine nucleotide. The clusters of CpGs form CpG islands, which often locate at the promoters of genes. As the promoters of genes are the binding sites of transcription machinery, the methylation of CpG island within the genes promoters usually leads to the silence of gene expression. On the other hand, the hypomethylation of CpG island may help to activate the gene expression.</li>
<li>The tumour suppressor genes are served to suppress the cancer occurrence. However, if the CpG island of the tumour suppressor genes is hypermethylation, the tumour suppressor genes will be inactivate and silence, which may eventually lead to cancer. </li>
<li>In contrast, the hypomethylation of CpG  island in the oncogenes can lead to cancers too. The hypomethylation of CpG change the silence state the the oncogenes, allowing the gene expression occurs in oncogenes and causing cancers.</li>
</ul><p><br /></p>
<ul><li>Secondly, the alteration in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. Intergenic region is noncoding DNA sequences located between genes. Repetitive elements are multiple copies of DNA patterns throughout the genome. The DNA methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements may serve to maintain the genomic integrity. </li><li>The hypomethylation at intergenic regions/repeats leads to the genomic instability, like the illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transpositions, the activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes. The genomic instability can lead to wrong activation of oncogenes and silence the tumour suppressor genes, which may eventually cause cancers.</li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><br /></p>
<ul><li><span>The expression of lgf2 is enhanced by the downstream enhancers. In the maternal allele, the CTCF, an insulator protein, prevents the lgf2 from interacting with the downstream enhancers. Thus, the lgf2 will be silence in the maternal allele and corresponding enhancers change to bind the H19, which activate the expression of H19. </span></li>
</ul><p><br /></p>
<ul><li>But in the paternal allele, the DNA methylation at the intergenic regions blocks the binding of CTCF proteins. Also the DNA methylation spreads to the H19 promoter, and silence the expression of H19. As the insulation of CTCF in lgf2 is removed and the downstream enhancers are able to active the lgf2 expression.</li>
</ul><p><br /></p>
<ul><li>In the Wilm’s tumour, the imprinting epigenetic markers of maternal allele is changed. The DNA methylation pattern in the maternal allele in the same as the paternal allele, which leads to over expression of lgf2 and silence of H19.</li>
</ul><p><br /></p>
<ul><li><span>The lgf2 is oncogene, and its expression is associated with growth promoting,  The expression of lgf2 in both maternal and paternal alleles lead the the over growth promoting and thus causes Wilm’s tumour.</span></li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>The Decitabine is nuceloside analogues. It belongs to the DNMT inhibitors.</li>
</ul><p><br /></p>
<ul><li>The DNA methylation maintained by DNMT1, a de novo methyltransferases. During replication, the DNMTs incorporated in the DNA and maintain the methylation in the daughter DNAs. The Decitabine can irreversibly bind the DNMTs, thus inhibits the DNA methylation in the next generation of DNA.</li>
</ul><p><br /></p>
<ul><li><span>As the Decitabine can inhibit the DNA methylation, it can help to anti-tumours, which depends on tumour suppressor gene hypermethylation, like Haematological malignancies. Reducing the hypermethylation in the tumour suppressor gens may lead to their re-activation, which helps to suppress the cancer.</span></li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>* The DNA methylation is epigenetic modification. It can be inheritable from DNA to its next generation, which explained the enduring effects.</p>
<p>* The treatment that alter DNA methylation should be avoided in young patients. Because it can affect the epigenetic reprogramming in the germ cells. </p>
<p>* There are several sensitive periods during development, including primordial germ cell development and early
development. </p>
<p>* The alteration of DNA methylation in the sensitive periods can change the normal status of the germ cells and thus leads to disease.</p></div>
