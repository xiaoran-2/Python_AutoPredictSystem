    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal consequence of DNA
methylation at CpG islands is the silencing of the corresponding genes. CpG
islands are usually free of methylation in normal cells. However, in cancer, DNA
methylation at CpG islands increases with time. This disruption of DNA
methylation contributes to the progression of cancer by silencing tumour
suppressor genes. In intergenic regions and repetitive elements, DNA
methylation normally represses gene expression. In cancer, there is a progressive
increase of DNA hypomethylation in these intergenic regions and repetitive
elements. This phenomenon contributes to genomic instability and a resulting abnormal
karyotype.<span>This
is achieved through mechanisms such as recombination between repeats,
activations of repeats, transpositions, activation of cryptic promoters.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The
disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, as illustrated by the
example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In this
case, the methylation patterns of the paternal and maternal alleles differ from
each other, resulting in different expression of each allele based on the
parent-of-origine of this allele. In a normal cell, the imprint control region
(ICR) of the maternal allele is unmethylated. A protein (CTCF) at the level of
the ICR insulates IgF2, protecting it from the effect of its downstream enhancers.
Igf2 is not expressed, but H19 is expressed. On the paternal allele, DNA methylation
is present at the level of the ICR and CTCF is no more bound to the ICR. In the
absence of CTCF, the DNA methylation propagates to H19 which is silenced. In
contrast, the downstream enhancers are free to influence the expression of Igf2.</p><p>In Wilm’s tumour, there is
an hypermethylation of the ICR, both on maternal and paternal alleles. This
disruption of imprinting results in a silencing of H19 and an overexpression of
Igf2. As H19 regulates negatively cell proliferation and Igf2 is on the contrary growth promoting, this condition
favours the growth of the tumour.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Decitabine
is a drug belonging to the class of the inhibitors of the DNA methyltranferases
(DNMT inhibitors). These drugs are nucleosides analogues which bind DMNTs.  A drug like Decitabine acts against the inappropriate
methylation present in some regions of the DNA of cancer cells, for instance at
the level of the ICR’s. The drug induced DNA demethylation can lead in cancer
cells to the reactivation of silenced genes with tumour-suppressing effect.</span><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The class of epigenetic drugs altering DNA methylation can have an effect beyond the period of treatment. Indeed, as for other epigenetic
changes, the drug-induced alteration of DNA methylation can be mitotically
transmitted.<br /></p>

<p>This fact implies caution as the normal cells may be submitted to deleterious epigenetic
disruption during sensitive periods.</p>

<p>A sensitive period is a
period when the cells have their epigenetic marks reprogrammed. The sensitive
periods are the early development of the embryo at pre-implantation, the primordial germ cells development in
the embryo at mid-gestation and the phases meiosis, oocyte maturation and spermiogenesis.<br /></p>

<p>Therefore, particularly in younger patients
susceptible to await children, the potential effect on the embryo and on the germ cells of drugs
altering DNA methylation need to be considered. The critical phases when
avoiding treating patients are obviously the period of
gestation, but also the pre-conception period. For instance, while treated with these drugs and some months after treatment, women must avoid pregnancy and men must avoid fathering children.<br /></p>
