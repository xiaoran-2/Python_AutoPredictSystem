    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, DNA methylation at CpG islands located near gene
promoter regions is associated with gene silencing especially imprinted genes
and others found on an inactive X chromosome. These methylated regions enable
repressive elements to bind and therefore disallowing transcription.   In cancers, CpG islands located near gene promoters
of tumor suppressor genes are often found to be methylated rendering them
inactive. Inactivation of a tumor suppressor genes for example can lead to proliferation
of particular cells containing this disruption since DNA metylation is
mitotically heritable if such disruption give theses defective (cancer) cells
an advantage over other normal cells. Intergenic regions and repetitive
elements throughout the genome are also normally found to be methylated. The
opposite however is observed in cancers. While unmethylated, intergenic regions
can result in cryptic transcription start and splice sites which can result in reciprocal
translocation, deletion and insertions common defects found in cancers. Methylation
and consequently silencing repetitive elements prevents transposition and
transcriptional interference which can occur when not silenced or methylated. In
both cases, methylation therefore helps to maintain genomic stability and prevents
defects that can lead to cancers. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the normal H19/Igf2 cluster the paternal allele is imprinted and therefore methylated as appose to the maternal allele. CTCF cannot bind to the imprinted region of the male allele allowing for the enhancers (produced from both alleles) to activate the Igf2 gene instead allowing for its expression from that allele alone. On the maternal allele CTCF binds to the unmethylated ICR and the enhancers act on the H19 gene while the Igf2 gene remains silent. The end result is Igf2 expression and end product from one allele instead both seen in Wilm's tumor due to the fact that we have a lost of imprinting resulting from hypermethylation of the ICR of the maternal allele. This methylated ICR of the maternal allele now mirrors that of the paternal in which the Igf2 active as CTCF cannot of course bind to ICR. This results in a double dose of Igf2 as the genes on both alleles are active which lead to cancer as Igf2 is a growth promoter. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine and other similar agents acts to reduce DNA methylation and are called DNA-demethylating agents. These agents reduces DNA methylation and can therefore treat cancers to some effect since DNA hypermethylation of especially tumor suppressor genes is a cancer hallmark. Tumor suppressor genes for example can resume normal functions within cell when unmethylated by these drugs allowing for cell death if necessary due other errors or proliferation with corrected normal unmethylated epigenetic markers.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that alter DNA-methylation have effects that last beyond the period of the drug treatment because DNA-methylation is mitotically heritable. The resulting epigenetic state whether desirable or not after treatment is transferred to the daughter cells (if survive) and those cells retains that change that was previously affected. For this reason, some drugs that do affect DNA-methylation or other epigenetic sources of cancers are not given to children of certain age due to development of sperm and oocytes undergoing inside them or women who are pregnant or about to be which are sensitive periods of development.</div>
