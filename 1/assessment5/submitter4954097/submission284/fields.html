    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA
methylation at the CpG islands is associated with the silencing of genes whose
promoter regions contain these CpG islands. This is attributed to ineffective
binding of the RNAp enzyme to the promoter site and hence the start of
transcription. CpG islands are normally  unmethylated but there is a
marked hypermethylation of these islands during cancer development. When the
CpG islands associated with genes involved in growth suppression a.k.a Tumor
Suppressor Genes (TSGs) are hypermethylated, they are no longer expressed. This leads
to unregulated growth of the cells and hence tumor. <br /><br />
DNA methylation in the intergenic regions help silence hidden promoters within
these regions. These promoters if hypomethylated are active and can drive
unusual transcription of neighbouring genes and often thwart their normal
expression by anti-sense transcription. In cancer cell, such disruption occurs to TSGs.  Importantly, Imprint Control regions are also intergenic and found
within a cluster of imprinted genes it controls. These genes are often
associated with growth and is the normal methylation status of an ICR is
disrupted overgrowth or undergrowth results. Several, well known syndromes occurring
due to disrupted ICR methylation are:</span></p>

<p><span>1.     
</span>Beckwith
Witherman syndrome</p>

<p><span>2.     
</span>Angelman
syndrome</p>

<p><span>3.     
</span>Prader
Willi syndrome</p>

<p><span><br />
Similarly, DNA methylation helps to keep in check the illegitimate jumping and
copying of repetitive elements within the genome. This helps in maintaining
genomic stability. The repetitive elements can lodge itself within a gene
rendering it useless. It can also cause gene insertion, deletion and
recombination with unnatural consequences. But in a methylated state  the
repetitive element is unable to replicate itself and is silenced.<br /><br />
The repetitive elements get hypomethylated during cancer. The resulting genomic instability can cause cancer as this might
disrupt the function of some tumor suppressor genes. Also,
an unmethylated repetitive element can also have a very strong promoters which
can run into other neighbouring genes, often incompletely or antisense, to
disrupt its normal expression.</span><br /></p><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The ICR
of <i>Igf2/H19</i> cluster is encased by <i>Igf2</i> and <i>H19</i> genes. In a normal cell, the ICR on the maternal allele is
unmethylated and binds a CTCF protein to form an insulator. This insulator
overshadows the interaction between the enhancer regions and the promoter of <i>Igf2</i> causing it to be silenced. The
enhancers however help express <i>H19</i>.
On the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated and thus unbound by CTCF. The <i>Igf2</i>, being the more preferable target
for enhancer regions, becomes active. Due to the absence of CTCF, the
methylation has been found to spread into the promoter of <i>H19</i> thus silencing it. </span></p>

<p><span>Wilm’s
Tumor occurs when the ICR on the maternal allele of the cluster is also
methylated in kidney cells. The <i>Igf2</i>
gene, which is an oncogene and promotes growth, becomes active on both the alleles
– normally so on the paternal allele and due to its disrupted ability to form a
CTCF insulator on the maternal allele. The resulting unrestrained growth forms
a tumor.</span></p>

<p><span>If this condition is accompanied by several other disruptive hits to
the genome AND/OR the epigenome of a cell, cancer can result. Knudsen's hypothesis makes a single imprinting disorder insufficient for cancer.<br /></span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine
is one of the FDA approved DNA methyl transferase inhibitors. It inhibits
DNMT3a which is involved in de novo methylation of DNA. There are certain cancers
with predominant hypermethylation profile such as myelodysplastic syndrome.
Decitabine inhibits the DNMTs in these tumors to reduce the methylation of
tumor suppresoor genes. This can help reduce the tumor growth.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The
epigenome reserves the capacity to alter the genome of cell. While there are
instances of  disruption of gene integrity and activity by epigenetically unchecked
IAPs, the altered epigenetic system can also affect the DNA repair capabilities of
the cell. In such cases, epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation can lead to
more robust changes in the genome in the form of change in DNA sequence or DNA mutation.
Hence, certain drugs targeted at epigenome of a cancer cell, can actually leave
an altered DNA sequence and with it a susceptibility to further silencing or
activation OR relocation in the nuclear architecture. </p>

<p>There
are sensitive periods during development when the epigenetic marks of the
organism or its progeny are being laid down and they are most susceptible to
undue environmental stress. Early embryonic development and primordial germ cell development are two such sensitive phases when the epigenome is reprogrammed. For e.g. the germ cells of a female human are still
developing during the early childhood and if exposed to certain epigenetic modifier drugs, the progenitors of the future generation can be afflicted with illegitimate epigenetic changes. Therefore it is inadvisable to use these drugs these sensitive phases.<br /></p>
