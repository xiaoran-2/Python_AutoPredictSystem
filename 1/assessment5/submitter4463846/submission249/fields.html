    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at CpG islands is intended to halt genetic transcription at promoters. <br /><br />In cancer, there is a genome-wide lack of methylation that lowers genomic stability, but CpG islands are typically hypermethylated.<br /><br />Because there are abnormal levels of CpG methylation, certain methylated islands silence genes intended to suppress tumor growth. Over time, methylation at CpG islands increase, contributing more to the tumor's ability to grow unimpeded.<br /><br />DNA methylation at intergenic regions maintains genomic stability and silences cryptic splice/transcription sites. For repetitive elements, it's intended to prevent repeats from inserting themselves into other parts of the genome, avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters, and prevent illegitimate recombination.<br /><br />In cancer, methylation is disrupted and there is genome-wide hypomethylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements that lowers genomic stability. <br /><br />This would lead to more mutations in the genome, and we know that cancer is caused by mutations that increase cell division and cell growth.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">CTCF is an insulator protein that connects to the imprint control region to protect the Igf2 gene from downstream enhancers by methylating the promoter of H19, (because normally H19 would read the downstream enhancers). In the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated which prevents CTCF from binding to it. <br /><br />In the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated so that CTCF can bind and protect Igf2 from the downstream enhancers. Igf2 is not expressed, H19 is.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumor, both ICR's are methylated, so you have 2x the amount of expression from Igf2 (which promotes growth) and causes the tumor.<br /><br />In cancer, you have a loss of imprinting and both ICRs are methylated, and downstream enhancers enhance the expression of Igf2 which promotes growth and tumor creation. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-methylating agent created to treat myelodysplastic syndromes. This drug can be used to treat cancer by demethylating a tumor-suppressing gene MDR-1. Thus, MDR-1 does its job properly and reduces the size of the tumor. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation can have enduring effects on gene expression because methylation is mitotically heritable. All future cells will carry the results of the drug's interference. You would probably avoid treating patients during sensitive periods, or times when the epigenome is most susceptible to change. Otherwise, you might permanently methylate genes that you didn't intend to. Sensitive periods of development include germ cell development and during preimplantation and early cell development. </div>
