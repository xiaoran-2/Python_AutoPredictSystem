    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at CpG islands and island shores in the promoter region can lead to silencing of a gene, and so CpG islands in the promoters of active genes are usually hypomethylated. In cancer, CpG islands at promoter regions of tumour suppressor genes are hypermethylated; this leads to underexpression or silencing of the tumour suppressor gene, which in turn can cause uncontrolled cell division. This will lead to a tumour. <br />At intergenic regions and repetitive elements, there is usually hypermethylation as this maintains genomic stability by preventing illegitimate recombination between repeats; maintaining the inactive state of repeats and transposition; ensuring cryptic promoters remain inactive and neighbouring genes are not disrupted. In cancer, genome-wide hypomethylation occurs, which reduces genomic stability, meaning the above processes are not carried out efficiently. This can lead to transcriptional aberrations, which may inactivate tumour suppressor genes and activate oncogenes.   <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The ICR of this cluster is usually methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele. This means that H19 is usually expressed on the maternal allele only, and Igf2 is expressed on the paternal allele only. However, in Wilm's tumour, the ICRs on both alleles are methylated, meaning that both copies of Igf2 are expressed, and neither copy of H19 is expressed. This causes tumorigenesis because Igf2 is growth promoting, so its overexpression can cause a cancerous tumour, in this case Wilm's tumour, to form. <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, and therefore reduces DNA methylation at its sites of action.<br /> In cancer, tumour suppressor genes can become hypermethylated, deactivating them and allowing uncontrollable cell division to occur, increasing tumorigenesis. When Decitabine removes this extra DNA methylation, the tumour suppressor gene is reactivated and so cell division is controlled. This means that there is less uncontrollabe cell division, so tumours are less likely to appear and to increase in size.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is a very stable epigenetic mark: it is only rewritten during sensitive periods of development, such as pre-implantation development and primordial germ cell development. These are the times when epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation are removed and different ones are established; they are known as sensitive periods because they are the times at which the epigenome is most vulnerable to changes in the environment.<br />Treating patients with drugs that alter the epigenome would be inadvisable during these periods because, not only could it result in wrong expression of certain genes (as the drugs would not necessarily discriminate between healthy and cancerous cells), but it could also affect the germline. This could result in genetic diseases in a patient's offspring as some epigenetic marks could be changed during primordial germ cell development.</div>
