    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>In a normal cell, there
is hypomethylated CpG islands and hypermethylated introns, intergeneic regions
and repetitive elements. At this stage, hypomethylation of CpG islands lead to
normal expression of tumor suppressor genes. On the other hand, hypermethylation
in remaining areas leads to genomic stability. </span></p><p><span>When a cell progresses to become
a cancer cell, the hypo-hypermethylation status completely reverses.
Hypomethylation of intergeneic regions, introns and repetitive elements
increases genomic instability and leads to erroneous chromosomal
translocations, deletion or insertions. Whereas, hypermethylation in areas such
as CpG islands may cause silencing of tumor suppressor genes and allowing the
tumor cells to proliferate freely without any restrictions.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>In a normal cell for
H19/Igf2 locus, there occurs methylation of ICR for paternal allele and no
methylation of ICR for maternal allele. The CTCF complex interacts and binds to
the ICR on maternal allele. This complex insulates the enhancers to interact
with Igf2; rather interact with H19 resulting in tis transcription. Whereas,
CTCF complex is unable to interact and bind on paternal allele due to the
methylated ICR and also silenced H19 due to hypermethylated CpG promoter of H19
gene. Hence, the enhancers reach out for Igf2 instead of H19 and bring out its expression.
As a result, there is always a single allele expression of Igf2 from paternal
strand and H19 from maternal strand. </span></p><p><span>With hypermethylation of ICR, both alleles
tend to behave similarly expressing Igf2. Now cells expresses double the dose
of Igf2. Under such increased Igf2 conditions, which is a potent growth
promoting factor, the cells lose their cell cycle control and progresses to uncontrolled
tumorigenic growth.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA
methyl transferase inhibitors or DNA demethylating agents. It binds irreversibly
to the DNA methyl transferase enzyme rendering it inactive. Hence, it will
cause hypomethylation of DNA or decrease the methylation of DNA. Decitabine hypomethylating
in a locus specific manner causes accidental activation of tumor suppressor
genes that finally inhibits the tumor. Decitabine has been useful in treating
myelodysplastic syndrome that is a prelude to some leukemia.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs targeting DNA
methylation for treatment produces global effects in methylation pattern that
occurs only once. These lasting effects can be ascertained by DNA methyl
transferases as theses enzymes tend to preserve the methylation status thereafter
during mitosis. </p>

<p>Sensitive
period is a time of individual development that is highly susceptible to
environmental signals or epigenetic alterations.</p>

<p> Treating with such drugs during sensitive
period might bring in some adverse affects with the normal homeostasis of
individual. Hence, it would be unadvisable to treat patients with such
methylation altering drugs especially at times of <span>mid-gestation
pregnancy, developing period of PGCs of embryo, age of developing germ cell, early
growth period of individuals (infant stage; 1-2 years), etc. </span></p></div>
