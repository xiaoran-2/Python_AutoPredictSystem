    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to a class of drug called DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor. <br />Decitabine has the ability to inhibit DNA hypermethylation, restore suppressor gene expression and exert antitumor effects.<br />Decitabine is a first-generation DNMT inhibitor, a cytidine analog. When decitabine is imported in the cells, they are converted to tri-phosphorylated active forms. Then, to be active, decitabine need to be incorporated into the DNA of replicating cells. Once incorporated, decitabine will be recognized by DNMT as normal cytidine, forming a covalent link. However, the covalent bond between decitabine and DNMT is irreversible, and thus DNMT is trapped by decitabine, triggering proteasomal degradation of DNMT. With less DNMT, the cancer cells are less likely to be hypermethylated and hence increase the expression of tumor suppressor genes, thus killing the cancer cells.  </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">The normal function of DNA methylation at the CpG islands is to control the expression of the gene. Most of the CpG islands are located in the promoter region of the gene. When these genes are hypermethylated, the expression of the genes will be turned down. When these CpG islands are not hypermethylated, gene expression can go as normal. <br />In cancer cell, the promoter region or CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes are more likely to be hypermethylated. <br />By disrupting the DNA methylation pattern at CpG islands of the tumor suppressor genes, the proteins that controll cell cycle, DNA repair, and apoptosis cannot be fully expressed to save the cell from going rogue. <br />The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic and repetitive regions are to minimize the risk of breaking chromosome integrity.<br />Most cancers demonstrate a loss of methylation in the intergenic regions and repetitive elements, making the chromosomes more vulnerable to illegitimate chromosome translocations. These abnormal chromosome translocations my yield oncogenic abnormal proteins that will facilitate the growth and proliferation of the cancer cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the paternal allele, methylation at the imprint control region (ICR) of H19/ igf2 cluster blocks the binding of CTCF, an insulator protein. Without CTCF binding,  the enhancers in the H19/igf2 cluster could access igf2, bypassing ICR, and enhance igf2 expression in the paternal allele. In addition, DNA methylation at the ICR will spread to H19 promoter, silencing H19. <br />In the maternal allele, there is no methylation at the ICR of H19/igf2 cluster. CTCF will be able to insulate igf2 from the binding of enhancers in the cluster. In addition, H19 is not methylated as well and the enhancer will augment the expression of H19 instead. <br />In the model of Wilm's tumor, the loss of imprint happens in the maternal allele, which gains methylation at the ICR. Therefore, CTCF no longer binds to ICR. H19 in the maternal allele will be silenced and igf2 expressed instead. <br />Thus, disrupting imprinting at the H19/ifg2 cluster makes the maternal allele acts like the paternal H19/ifg2 cluster, with enhanced expression of igf2 instead of H19. And if both maternal and paternal allele highly expresses ifg2 gene, which a growth factor, cancer such as Wilms' tumor are more likely to develop. <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The mitotic heritability of DNA methylation alteration stems from that the DNMT will act on the same region in the DNA to perform methylation after cell replication to ensure that the same epigenetic code is carried on.<br />A sensitive period is a period where all epigenetic marks, such as DNA methylation are removed and reprogrammed. <br />During development, sensitive periods where epigenetic reprogramming could happen include primodial germ cell development and preimplantation period of early embryo development.<br />Treating patients in the sensitive period may disrupt the reprogramming of the epigenetic marks in the embryo or even the gametes of the embryo. By this way, an ever-lasting epigenetic feature may be imprinted in the DNA of the next generation. This change may affect the future development or phenotype of the children. In addition, if the epigenetic marks were inked in the gametes of the children,  this change in epigenetics may als affect the phenotype of the grandchildren generation. </div>
