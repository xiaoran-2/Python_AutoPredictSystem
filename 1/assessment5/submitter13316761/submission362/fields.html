    <div class="field-value"><div>In normal cells, CpG islands are generally hypomethylated, whereas the other areas of the genome including the repetitive elements and the intergenic regions are generally methylated. This is the opposite in cancer cells, where you find that CpG islands are more likely to be methylated and the rest of the genome is hypomethylated. The abnormal DNA methylation that occurs at the CpG islands causes epigenetic silencing of the tumor suppressors genes, thereby not allowing these genes to do their job, which in turn leads to the development of cancer. In addition, the cells that have this CpG methylation are more likely to divide rapidly and not die as easily, therefore they take over and this allows cancer to progress over time in the tissues. It should also be noted that CpG island shores, or neighboring areas, are also hypermethylated in cancer</div><div>   </div><div>Outside of the CpG islands, DNA methylation occurs normally throughout the genome. However, in cancer cells there is hypomethylation throughout the genome. The areas that are affected include the repetitive elements, the intergenic regions, and other areas. This genome-wide hypomethylation has a consequence depending on where it is happening, usually occurs early, and like CpG hypermethylation progresses over time. In a normal cell, the repetitive elements and the intergenic regions are in a state of heterochromatin, or more tightly packed. But in cancer, these regions are hypomethylated and tend to be euchromatin in nature, or more open, and this causes genomic instability.  What generally occurs is illegitimate recombination (or misalignment) between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes. The overall outcome of this genomic instability causes cells to have additional deletions, insertions (or gain parts of chromosomes) and reciprocal translocations in cancer.</div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>One common feature of cancer cells is that they display a loss of imprinting at their imprinting control regions (ICRs). Genes that should be displaying monoallelic parent of origin specific expression, no longer do so. Instead, either both parental alleles are expressed, or there is no expression at all, and both parental alleles are silent. This hypo or hypermethylation most likely occurs in cancer because many imprinted genes are involved in growth – they either promote or suppress growth. For example, hypermethylation, or over expression, can occur at the H19/Igf2 cluster. In a healthy cell, this cluster would show methylation at the ICR of only the paternal allele and not at the ICR of the maternal allele, thus Igf2 would only be expressed from the paternal allele. The maternal allele normally remains silent (or unmethylated at Igf2) because of a CTCF binding factor which blocks it. However, with loss of imprinting caused by hypermethelyation, this cluster will show methylation at the ICR from both the maternal and the paternal alleles, causing Igf2 to be dually expressed. This double dose of Igf2, a growth promoter, has been linked to the formation of Wilm’s tumor - a type of childhood kidney cancer.</div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>The epigenetic drug Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) approved for use in myelodysplastic syndrome that has progressed to AML. As a nucleoside analogue, it is incorporated into the DNA, where it produces an irreversible inactivation of DNA methyltransferase. The action of this DNMTi is division (or replication) dependant. Because cancer cells replicate faster than normal cells they are severely affected by this drug. It has been shown that at low doses (or at the correct range) this drug effectively causes DNA demethylation in affected patients, producing an anti-neoplastic effect (halts growth) that causes tumor cell death. However, since this drug most likely affects all dividing cells in the body, the long term effects are not entirely known. It’s thought that Decitabine may be effective in myelodysplastic syndrome because it’s dependent on CpG island hypermethylation, which is known to have a poor outcome for myelodysplastic syndrome.</div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that alter DNA methylation can pass these epigenetic changes on during cell division to daughter cells and then to granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, they are unable to return. These drugs are, in effect, able to stop the growth of cancer without killing all of the surrounding cells. This may be why they are successful when used in combination with other chemotherapies, since most chemo drugs are known to kill cancer cells along with healthy cells. However, it should be noted that epigenetic drugs are employed throughout the body’s system, so they have the potential to affect every cell in the body. Knowing this, it may not be suitable to use these drugs on patients during sensitive periods of development, in other words in young patients (early life), particularly those with developing germ cells. The long term effects from these drugs are not known at this time and there isn’t enough data to conclude whether or not these drugs would adversely affect normal cellular development. </div>
