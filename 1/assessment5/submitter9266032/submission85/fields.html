    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer states are
generally marked by genome-wide Hypomethylation and locus specific (including
CpG island and shores) Hypermethylation relative to normal cells. </p>

<p><span>In healthy cells, the hypomethylation
of CpG islands results in expression of tumor suppressor gene promoters.  In cancer these islands become
hypermethylated and this methylation results in disrupting the promoter and silencing
of tumor suppressor genes.</span></p>

<p><span>Genome-wide
hypomethylation impacts the intergenic regions and repetitive elements that are
methylated in normal cells.  The normal
methylated state contributes to genomic stability by preventing illegitimate recombination
between repeats and ensuring the silencing of repeats and transpositions.  Removal of the DNA methylation results in the
activation of these portions of the genome and erodes the normal controls on
genomic stability.</span></p>

<p>CpG Poor Promoters may
also be hypomethylated in the cancer state which can contribute to cancer in cases
where the promoter is associated with an oncogene that becomes overexpressed.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA Methylation in ICRs may be altered in either the hyper or hypo direction during
cancer resulting in the possibility of reduced expression of growth
restricting genes or the overexpression of growth promoting genes. </p>

<p>H19/Igf2 is an example
where change of methylation in an ICR results in
overexpression of a growth promoting gene.</p>

<p>For H19/Igf2 in
healthy cells the paternal allele of
the ICR is methylated.  This methylation
silences the H19 region, while enhancers downstream of H19 are able to work
back up the genome and activate the Igf2 gene upstream of the ICR.  In the maternal allele the ICR is
unmethylated which allows it to recruit a CTCF insulating protein.  H19 is active on the maternal allele and is
acted on by the downstream enhancers.  The
enhancers however are not able to act on Igf2 due to the insulating effect
of the CTCF protein on the ICR resulting in no Igf2.<br /></p>

<p>Disruption of imprinting
on the maternal allele of the ICR results in a methylated state matching the paternal allele.  This
state results in expression of the Igf2 gene on both alleles
and a net overexpression of Igf2 which can result in the formation of a Wilm’s
tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an FDA
approved drug for the treatment of specific blood conditions including ineffective
production of blood cells and for acute myeloid leukemia.</p>

<p><span>Decitabine belongs to the
class of drugs known as  DNA
methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) and functions by binding to DNA
methyltransferase, preventing the normal methylation replication process in
dividing cells. The net result is a hypomethylation impact.</span></p>

<p><span>Hypomethylation from
Decitabine has the potential to have a positive impact on certain cancers that
rely on the hypermethylation (and hence inactivation) of tumor suppressor genes.  Decitabine's removal of the methylation marks allow the tumor suppressor genes to be expressed which then act to reduce tumor growth. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> Drugs that impact DNA
methylation can have an impact beyond their specific treatment period because
DNA methylation changes tend to be enduring and mitotically inherited through
the life of an organism.</p>

<p><span>There are two primary periods
during development when DNA methylation patterns are reset on nearly a genome-wide
scale.  The first of these “Sensitive” periods
occurs during the progression from fertilized egg to blastocyst and the second
is during the development of primordial germ cells.  </span></p>

<p>Exposure to a methylation
impacting drug or other environmental factor during these sensitive periods has
the potential to disrupt critical imprinted methylation marks including
X-inactivation.</p>

<p><span>Because of this risk, it
is not recommended that women who are pregnant or attempting to become pregnant
be treated with this class of drugs as the methylation disruption could have a
deleterious impact on the prospective child as well as the grandchild of the patient.</span></p></div>
