    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>In normal
cells , the CpG islands found upstream to promoters are hypomethylated , and
introns , intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated. In
contrast to the normal cells, the DNA methylation state  in cancerous cells is reverse, i.e CpG
islands are hypermethylated and hypomethylation of introns, intergenic regions
and repetitive elements occurs.</span></p>

<p><span>As CpG
islands are found around promoters of housekeeping genes (i.e genes which are
essential for normal cell functions), thus, 
in normal cells  they are in
hypomethylated state to allow the downstream genes to be expressed.  In cancerous cells,  the CpG islands of TUMOUR SUPPRESSOR
GENES(whose normal function is to regulate cell division) are hypermethylated(due
to increase in specific DNMT activity) and 
silenced. So, these tumour supperssor genes(TSGs) will no longer be able
to ckeck cell division thus leading to cancer.                                        Hypermethylation
of CpG islands of TSGs was reported in kidney, bladder, esophageal, pancreatic, and liver cancers .                                        In contrast to
hypermethylation of CpG islands of tumour suppressor genes , hypomethylation of
CpG islands of oncogenes may lead to their activity and tumour formation.</span></p>

<span>In normal cells, the intergenic regions  and repetitive regions are hypermethylated to
prevent transposition of repeats and avoid illegitimate recombination between
them, thus maintaining genomic integrity. In cancerous  tissue, these repeats and intergenic regions
are hypomethylated(due to decrease in specific DNMT activity) which  lead to  mutations like duplications, deletions,
translocations and insertions,  causing
genomic instability and thus cancer.          
                                                                                                                                          Hypomethylation of repeats(LINE 1) was
observed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, urinary bladder carcinoma,
hepatocellular carcinoma and postate carcinoma.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting
results in monoallelic parent-of-origin-specific expression of a subset of
alleles. Expression of imprinted genes is controlled by Imprint control
regions(ICRs) which are associated with DNA Methylation. Thus, an imprinted
gene has methylation at its respective Imprint control region(ICR).                                                                                                                                                                                                             Example :
The H19/Igf2 cluster                                                                                                                                                                                  In normal cells, the H19(tumour suppressor gene) is maternally expressed
and Igf2(an oncogene) is paternally imprinted. In
normal cells, the <b>ICR of paternal allele
is methylated</b>, thus blocking CTCF(an insulator protein which insulates Igf2
from downstream enhancers) from binding to ICR leading to spread of methylation
to the H19 promoter resulting in silencing of H19 and increased access of
enhancers to Igf2 and its expression from paternal allele. In contrast to
expression of Igf2 from paternal allele, <b>the
ICR of maternal allele is not methylated</b> and is bound by CTCF blocking enhancers
from Igf2 and increasing their access to H19 promoter and its expression.                                                                   Wilm’s tumour is caused by loss of imprinting. The maternal allele
reverses to paternal epigenotype i.e, hypermethylation of ICR and its spread to
H19 promoter which results in  silencing of
H19(inactivated tumour suppressor gene) from both alleles and increased or biallelic
expression of Igf2(oncogene) from these alleles leading to tumour. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><b>Decitabine , a DNA methyl-transferase
inhibitor</b><span>(DNMT
inhibitor) is used to treat Myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid
leukemia. This class of drugs act as nucleoside analogues(decitabine is a
cytidine analog). As they are nucleoside analogs, they can get incorporated in
DNA during replication.                                                  
</span></p>

<p>DNMT
obstructs DNA replication and can also cause DNA damage through structural
instability at the site of incorporation. It can cause methylation of CpG islands
at promoters of tumour suppressor genes(TSGs) leading to their transcriptional silencing
and development of cancer. </p>

<p>Decitabine,
when incorporated into DNA , can covalently link to DNMT, thus not allowing CpG
islands methylation. This demethylation/hypomethylation at CpG islands will
restore transcriptional activity of TSGs and re-expression of other silenced
genes.</p>

<p><span>In  cancers where TSGs or other genes are
silenced due to hypermethylation of CpG islands, decitabine is shown to act by
preventing methylation and activate genes, thus showing anti-tumour effect. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>In normal
genome, DNA methylation is found at intergenic regions and repetitive elements.
This hypermethylated state at these regions helps in maintaining genomic
integrity by preventing transposition and illegitimate recombination. The CpG
islands of Tumour suppressor genes(TSGs) is hypomethylated in normal cells to
check cell division.                                                                                                                                       
Alteration to this pattern of DNA methylation can lead to tumour
formations. As DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, thus a change in the
pattern of methylation can be inherited or lost during development. Any drug
that modifies methylation pattern in cells can establish the change through
next generations.</span></p>

<p>But during
sensitive periods, the epigenetic marks are cleared/removed and re-established
again .The two periods of active re-programming are PRIMORDIAL GERM CELL
DEVELOPMENT and PRE AND POST-IMPLANTATION PERIODS. </p>

<p><span>As the
existing epigenetic marks are cleared during sensitive periods and new lineage
specific marks are established in the next generations(or lineage of cells),
treating patients with drugs that modify their DNA methylation pattern during a
sensitive period would not be established but lost during programming and thus
not maintained for further divisions.                                                                                                                              </span>Use of these drugs might sometimes affect/change the methylation pattern
in PRIMORDIAL GERM CELLS  of the patients
thus causing mutations in further generations.  </p></div>
