    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Disruption of imprinting can interfere with expression of tumor-suppressor genes, and with the control of the expression of growth-promoting genes. This latter effect is seen when the maternal allele of the <i>H19/Igf2</i> cluster acquires the paternal pattern and is methylated; a consequence of this patten is the enhanced production of the growth factor Igf2, because both alleles are actively expressed.</span></p>
<p><span>	The paternal ICR (imprinting control region) has undergone imprinting, and thus is methylated, and cannot be bound by the insulating protein, CTCF. As a result, chromosome looping events give downstream enhancer sequences access to the <i>Igf2</i> gene. (Moreover, methylation spreads into the nearby H19 region, and the production of the long noncoding RNA is suppressed.)</span></p>
<p><span>	Normally, the maternal ICR is not methylated, and thus can be bound by CTCF. The enhancer sequences are denied access to the <i>Igf2</i> gene because the chromosome looping is inhibited by the presence of CTCF at the maternal ICR.</span></p>
<p><span>	When imprinting is disrupted, the maternal ICR also undergoes methylation; the maternal allele of <i>Igf2</i> is therefore also expressed. This is the situation in Wilm’s tumor. The resulting over expression of an important growth factor promotes entry of the cell into a constitutively proliferative state.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>	In cancer, DNA methylation patterns typically demonstrate hypermethylation within CpG islands and hypomethylation within other sites, i.e. intergenic and intragenic sites, and within repetitive elements.</span></p>
<p><span>	CpG islands are frequent components of gene promoter sites, and DNA methylation of CpG islands normally functions to reduce expression of genes under the control of the given promoter. Reduced expression of tumor-supressor genes is the result of hypermethylation of the promoters of these genes: reduced expression of tumor-supressor genes is a powerful influence to promote transformation of a cell to a cancerous state. Hypermethylation may result from aberrant activities of DNA methyltransferases; the enzyme may be the product of a mutated gene, or an over-expressed gene which has a mutation within a regulatory sequence.</span></p>
<p><span>	DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements serves to protect the genome from illicit recombination events, and to enable them to be included in regions of heterochromatin, thereby preventing disregulated gene expression.</span></p>
<p><span>	Hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements may result from aberrant activities of enzymes that promote demethylation (although this is a multistep process). The result of under-methylation of these regions may include illicit recombination (from regions of homology in repetitive sequences), and the over-expression of oncogenes that are normally silenced by becoming included within heterochromatin. Instability of the genome, and, entry into a constitutively proliferative state (under the influence of over-expressed oncogenes) are two strong influences that promote transformation of a cell into a cancerous state.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine inhibits hypermethylation of DNA by acting as a nucleoside analogue and irreversibly binding to a DNA methyltransferase. (It is a member of the DNMTi class of epigenetic inhibitors.) Because it does not remove methyl groups that are already incorporated in cytosine residues, it is only effective in replicating cells. Thus it is partly targeted to tumor cells, which are constitutively proliferative. Decitabine reduces the amount of DNA methylation in progeny cells. Its putative anti-cancer effect is that it relieves tumor suppressor cells of the silencing effects of hypermethylation of CpG islands in their promoter regions.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because methylation of cytosine residues is retained during and after mitosis. Thus, DNA methylation status of a sequence acts as a stable determinant of a cell’s phenotype. A sensitive period is a time during development in which epigenetic reprograming can take place, i.e. following nearly global demethylation events following fertilization, and later, just before formation of primordial germ cells during midgastrulation. Treating a patient with an epigenetic drug during a sensitive period is ill advised because it would likely interfere with regulation of establishment of normal epigenetic status of the phenotypically different cell lines (e.g. relatively heavy methylation of repetitive sequences), and would interfere with imprinting. Because oogenesis is not complete until shortly before fertilization, sensitive period extends to a period of a few months before fertilization.</span></p></div>
