</span><span></span></p><pre><code>Methylation </code><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">of promoter CpG islands (CpGIs) plays an important role in gene silencing, genomic imprinting and X-chromosome inactivation.
CpGIs located in nonpromoter regions play significant role in gene regulation; they are frequent targets for </span><i style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">de novo </i><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">methylation in cancer and
aging</span><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">. </span><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">CpGIs in promoter regions of transcriptionally active genes are normally not methylated; however, they tend to become hypermethylated in
cancer. Intragenic CpGIs can also be preferential sites for de novo methylation in cancer. Hyper methylation in CpGIs located in promoters of
(tumor suppressor genes) that control cell growth cause silencing of these genes leading to development of cancer.
Many cellular pathways are inactivated by hypermythylation of CpGIs including DNA repair, cell cycle, apoptosis, cell adherence, and detoxification.</span></pre>

<p> Heavy
methylation of repetitive DNA elements in normal tissues plays an important
role in a number of key processes including transcriptional silencing of these repetitive
elements, a condition associated with maintenance of chromosome structure and
genome integrity.  Main Epigenetic features
in cancer include hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements,
leading to genomic instability and oncogene activation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>·       </span><i>Igf2 I</i><span> gene is an imprinted gene
(Paternally expressed). </span> <span>Imprinting
control region (ICR) lies between <i>H19</i> and <i>igf2 </i>cluster of genes.
The state of methylation of this (ICR) determines which allele (paternal or
maternal) is imprinted.</span></p>

<p><span>·       </span><span> The ICR region is normally methylated only on
the paternally inherited copy of the gene cluster. Methylation of the paternal allele
inactivates the CTCF insulator protein binding and
permits Igf2 expression under the influence of the enhancers located
downstream of <i>H19</i> gene. Without CTCF binding, DNA methylation spreads to
<i>H19</i> promoter to silence and enhancers can access Igf2 to activate.</span></p>

<p><span>Maternal copy of the ICR is <b>not methylated</b> which
allows binding of CTCF to ICR. This binding blocks the expression of <i>igf2 </i>under
the influence of the enhancers.</span> Expression of both paternal and maternal alleles of <i>igf2</i>
gene, caused by epigenetic disruption (hyper methylation of the
two alleles) can lead to disruption of expression of
the <i>igf2/H19</i> gene cluster.</p>

<p><span>·       </span><span>Disruption
of expression due to hypomethylation of two parental alleles leads to increased
expression of the <i>IGF2</i> gene (growth promoting gene) and a loss
of H19 gene activity (growth restriction gene) in many tissues. As is
the case in Wilm’s tumour</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>·       </span>Decitabine, an
epigenetic drug that act as DNA-demethylating agent is used to treat
myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.</p>

<p> Decitabine hypomethylates
DNA by inhibiting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_methyltransferase" title="Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_methyltransferase">DNA methyltransferase . </a> triggers
an anti tumor “memory” response that includes inhibition of subpopulations of stem-like
self-renewing and tumorigenic cells. In addition, other anti tumor activities
accompany the inhibitory effect, including - decreased genomewide promoter DNA
methylation, gene re-expression, and changes in key regulatory pathways.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>·       </span><span>Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to
daughter and granddaughter cells through the action of the enzyme DNA
methyltransferase (Dnmt1). This makes DNA methylation an ideal target for enduring
treatment. However caution should be taken to avoid using administrating these
drugs during periods of DNA methylation reprogramming (periods of embryogenesis/gametogenesis
as in pregnant women).</span></p></div>
