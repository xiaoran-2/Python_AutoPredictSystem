    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are regions of the genome that are rich in CpG dinucleotides. These are commonly found in promoter region of genes. DNA methylation of these sites leads to silencing of these genes. Cancer is associated with hypermethylation of CpG islands. Increased methylation of CpG islands may lead to silencing of tumor suppressor genes, which can lead to cancer.<br /><br />DNA methylation is present normally in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. This prevents illegitimate recombination and prevents translocation of these regions.The intergenic and repetitive elements are seen to be hypomethylated in cancers.This hypomethylation is associated with increased genomic instability in general, and increased translocation frequency in particular. Translocation of intergenic or repetitive DNA elements into the midst of tumor suppressor genes can result in production of a non-functional protein, leading to cancer. Alternatively, some translocations of repetitive or intergenic sequences which have promoter like activity to the upstream of oncogenes can also lead to cancer by overexpression of the oncogenes.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The imprint control region (ICR) of the H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated on the paternal allele. This blocks the binding of the protein CTCF. Moreover, methylation of the ICR also leads to methylation of the H19 promoter region. Methylation of these two regions leads the downstream enhancer regions to activate Igf2 transcription, leading to increased Igf2 levels<br /><br />The ICR of H19/Igf2 cluster is not methylated on the maternal allele. This results in binding of CTCF at the ICR and methylation free status of the H19 promoter. CTCF acts as an insulator and prevents enhancer elements from activating transcription of Igf2, while aiding in the transcription of the H19 gene. Thus, unmethylated H19/Igf2 cluster results in decreased Igf2 expression.<br /><br />Wilm's tumor is commonly associated with epigenetic disruption at the H19/Igf2 cluster, where both maternal and paternal alleles of the H19/Igf2 cluster have methylated ICR. This results in Igf2 overexpression.<br /><br />Igf2 is a growth promoting gene, and overexpression of Igf2, which can be caused by methylation of both maternal and paternal allele at the H19/Igf2 ICR, can result in increased cell proliferation, one of the main features of cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a nucleotide analog that inhibits the activity of DNA methyltransferase.<br /><br />It causes hypomethylation of DNA since inhibition of DNA methyltransferase (which occurs in a replication dependent manner due to the mainenance nature of the DNA methyltransferase) leads to lesser methylation of DNA. <br /><br />Hypermethylation of CpG islands is a common feature of many cancers. Since CpG islands are seen in the promoter region of many genes and since DNA methylation usually unambiguously leads to gene silencing, various tumor suppressing genes may be being suppressed by methylation of CpG islands. Decitabine may have an anti-tumor effect by reversing hypermethylation of CpG islands of tumor suppresor genes.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is maintained even after mitosis by the action of DNA methyltransferase. The maintenance activity depends on methylation already being present at a locus before cell division. Therefore, altering DNA methylation at a locus will result in its inheritance by its daughter cells after mitosis. The change in phenotype caused by alteration of DNA methylation in the parent cell is thus inherited by the daughter cells.<br /><br />A sensitive period is a time when an organism/individual is naturally susceptible to epigenetic alterations in response to environmental conditions.<br /><br />Germ cell development and pre-implanation embryo development are two examples of sensitive periods. Individual organs may also have sensitive periods in the duration of their development.<br /><br />Sensitive periods are marked by clearing and relaying of epigenetic marks to produce proper expression of the genes required for normal development (like germ cells or embryos). Treatment of patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable since they are more susceptible to epigenetic alterations, leading to laying down of improper epigenetic marks. This results in deregulation of the crucial development process and is often associated with deleterious effects (such as infertility in the case of germ cells or abortion in case of embryos).<br /></div>
