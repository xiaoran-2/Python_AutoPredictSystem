    <div class="field-value">Methylation of promoters usually results in decrease of its gene expression. But more than half of all the genes have their promoters enriched with densly packed CpG sequences - so called CpG islands. Those are hypomethylated, and genes under their control are actively expressed. Tumor supressors (specific enzymes and protein regulators which control cell cycle and repress oncogenes) are among them.<br />In cancer CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated and thus tumor supressor genes which are controlled by promoters rich in CpG islands are repressed and inactive. This results in unregulated cell division, loss of division limit, apoptosis evasion and other disruptions in cell cycle that favor tumor growth.<br /><br />Intergenic regions and repetitive elements in normal state are hypermethylated in order to keep them in inactive state as they bring genomic instability. <br />Once they are hypomethylated and active as it occurs in certain types of cancer, chromosomal abberations such as deletions, insertions and translocations occur. These abnormalities are due to activation of mobile genomic elements such as transposons, improper recombination between repeats and activation of cryptic promoters - none of those events occur if intergenic regions and repetitive elements are silenced by methylation. This leads to - again - disruption of normal cell cecle flow and gain of malignance.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.

In case of such overexpression, cells recieve inapropriately forced signals to divide and grow. <br />This effect is potentiated by inhibition of CDKN1C expression, which codes for Cycline-dependent kinase inhibitor 1C, a cell cycle inhibitor.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><strong>Decitabine</strong> is a <i>DNA methyl transferase inhibitor</i>. It is used in myelodysplastic syndrome that has progressed to acute myeloid leukemia. <br /><br />It has a structure similar to cytidine and acts by incorporating into DNA and irreversibly binding DNMTs, thus <i>abrupting methylation process</i>. DNMTs' action is cell cycle-dependent - that means, it is active only in actively dividing cells (more precisely, those that are in S phase of mytotic cycle). Cancer cells divide much faster and more frequently than normal average cells in our body, so the highest impact of decibaine will be seen in cancer cells. <br /><br />Precise mechanism of action is still unknown, but anti-tumorous effect might be due to removal of hypermethylation that occurs in cancer and particulary in hematopoetic cancers.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically inherited - that is, altered by drugs methylation pattern will be maintained in all progenies of this particular cell.<br /><br />So, once established, particular methylation pattern is maintained through all the cell line. But there are so-called sensitive periods - periods during which all epigenetic marks are cleared and re-established.<br /><br />There are two sensitive periods: during early embryo development and during germ cells development.<br /><br />Using drugs targeting epigenetic machinery during sensetive periods can interfere with normal flow of removal and putting new epigenetic marks, DNA methylation in particular. This can result in abnormalities and diseases due to epigenetic changes in offsprings. That is why it's inadvisible to use epigenetic therapy during, for example, in early pregnancy and during all the pregnancy in women carrying a girl, during puberty etc.</div>
