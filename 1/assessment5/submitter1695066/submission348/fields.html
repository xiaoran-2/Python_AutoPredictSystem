    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The CpG
islands are normally hypomethylated in a normal cell but, in a cancer cell,
they tend to be hypermethylated. These CpG islands hypermethylated are usually
promoters of tumour suppressor genes, staying silenced with the
hypermethylation. The increase of hypermethylated CpG islands through of genome
contributes to cancer, there are less tumour suppressor genes actives. Intergenic
regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated in a normal cell and
hypomethylated in a cancer cell, in contrast with the CpG islands.
Hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements are associated
with genomic instability. The hypomethylation contributes to recombination
between repeats, activation of these repeats and transpositions and activation
of “offscreen” promoters, because the hypomethylation of these regions opens
the chromatin, making it more accessible. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the H19/lgf2 cluster, the imprint
control region (ICR) of the paternal allele is methylated but unmethylated in
the maternal allele. The CTCF binds to unmethylated ICR (maternal allele) and the enhancers can
act on H19 and the lgf2 stay silenced, however the CTCF cannot bind to
methylated ICR (paternal allele) and the enhancers will act on lgf2 and the H19 stay silenced. Lots of
genes of imprinting regions are associated with growth, as lgf2 gene. In
Wilm’s tumour, both ICRs are methylated (in the maternal and paternal allele),
so we have an overexpression of lgf2. This lead to an abnormal increase of cells growth associated
to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The Decitabine
is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi). The Decitabine is a nucleoside
analog that will be incorporated in DNA while replication. When the enzyme DNMT1
comes to bind this nucleotide, the DNMT1 becomes irreversibly bound and inactive. So, the
Decitabine stops the methylation made by DNMT1. Usually, the DNMT1 are mutated in
cancer cells, so this drug can to stop the aberrant methylation patterns that are
associated to some types of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The
epigenetic modifications, as alteration of DNA methylation, are passed on during
cell divisions, so they can have enduring effects on the epigenome and consequently to last beyond the period of drug treatment. However,
these epigenetic marks can be erased and reprogramed in some periods of
development, as known as, sensitive periods. This reprogramming of DNA
methylation takes place firstly in the inner cell mass (ICM) and secondly in
primordial germ cells. So, the treatment of young patients with epigenetic
modifications drugs during sensitive periods (in primordial germ cells, in this case) can to create epigenetic alterations in the germ line, leading to a transgenerational epigenetic inheritance.</p></div>
