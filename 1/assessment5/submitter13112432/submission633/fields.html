    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell, there are clusters of CpGs called CpG islands which are often found at promoters. Methylation of CpG islands are associated strongly with silencing of gene expression by recruiting other proteins to form repressive chromatin structure, or by preventing transcription factors from binding. In a cancer cell, however, CpG islands are often found to be hypermethylated in the promoter of tumor suppressor genes, or at sets of genes collectively, as in CpG island methlator phenotype (CIMP). When the tumor suppressor genes are silenced, aberrations could occur in the cell cycle or DNA repair leading to the development of cancer. <br />In contrast to the CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated in a normal cell. Methylation at intergenic regions prevent unwanted translation and splicing at cryptic sites, and methylation at repetitive elements silence the repeat and keeps it from making copies of itself and inserting elsewhere into (there by disrupting) the genome, and also silences promoters of the repetitive element which might cause unwanted translation of surrounding genes. In a cancer cell, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are in general hypomethylated. Without methylation of the intergenic regions, the unwanted translation and splicing prevented by methylation could occur, and with unmethylated repetitive elements rogue recombination could occur as well as activation of those repeats which will insert randomly into the genome. These disruptions to the genomic integrity is certainly the result of cancers in general but can themselves contribute to cancer if the right sets of genes are disrupted overtime.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The H19/Igf2 cluster is an imprinted gene, which means it is expressed in a parent-of-origin specific way. In the case of H19/Igf2 cluster, one the two genes H19 and Igf2  is expressed depending on which is bound by an adjacent enhancer which is controlled by the Imprint Control Region (ICR). In the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated, which blocks CTCF from binding to the ICR. Without CTCF interfering, the enhancers loops around and promotes Igf2 expression. On top of that, H19 is also silenced by heterochromatin spreading from ICR. In the maternal allele, on the other hand, there is no methylation at the ICR, so CTCF can freely bind to the ICR, preventing the enhancers from accessing Igf2, so the enhancers can only promote the expression of H19 as a second choice (which is unmethylated in the maternal allele).<br />In Wilm's tumor, there is a loss of imprinting due to hypermethylation at ICR, causing the ICR to be methylated at the maternal allele as well as the paternal, effectively chancing the expression of both to that of paternal, which doubles the Igf2 protein expression. Since Igf2 is growth promoting, hypermethylation at H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor. DNA methyltrasferases lays down the DNA methylation marks, and copies them to daughter cells across generations maintaining those methylation marks. Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue and it gets incorporated into the genome upon replication because it is chemcially similar to cytosine. However, when dnmt1 comes and tries to methylate it, the dnmt1 gets irreversibly bound to Decitabine. Since Decitabine needs to be incorporated into the genome during replication to work, the treatment, though effects all replicating cells in the body, should affect cancer cells more since they are dividing more rapidly. Decitabine also works especially well for cancers caused by CpG island hypermethylation, since Decitabine shuts down dnmt1 which is involved in DNA methylation. In myelodysplastic syndrome in particular, CpG hypermethylation is associated with poor prognosis, which is perhaps why Decitabine is particularly effective against it.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation most often occurs at CpG dinucleotides, and what makes CG special is that it is symmetrical on the opposing strand. Once de novo methylation marks are added, upon replication, the two strands will separate and each carries a methylated CG dinucelotide. After the new strand is synthesized, it results in a hemi-methylated DNA which can be act on by dnmt1 which methylates the unmethylated daughter stand according to the methylation pattern of the parent strand, recovering the original symmetrical methylation pattern, thus maintaining methylation across cell division.<br />However, there are still times at which the methylation pattern has to be removed. In particular during pre-implantation where the methylation pattern of the germ cells have to be removed to become pluripotent, and during primordial germ cell development where stomatic epigenetic marks have to be removed to form germ cells, during those sensitive periods where epigenetic reprogramming is occuring, it would be inadvisable to treat patients with epigenetic drugs because the new epigenetic marks are just being laid down and the drugs will impact the entire genome and will have long lasting effect on all subsequent differentiated cells, which presumably will have aberrant differentiation.</div>
