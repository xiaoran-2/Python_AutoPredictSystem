    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are mostly located at promoter regions. Their methylation induces repression of the specific gene. In normal cells, most CpG islands are kept free of methylation. In contrast, in cancer cells, GpG islands become hypermethylated, causing silencing of the specific gene. So, also many tumor suppressor genes happen to be silenced, and this can lead to cancer. <br />Intergenic regions and repetitive elements (repeats) are usually methylated in normal cells. In both cases, methylation helps to maintain genome stability. Intergene methylation can silence cryptic transcription start sites (i.e. poor promoters) which, if active, could interfere with a regular gene transcription. Moreover some cryptic splice sites are silenced with methylation. DNA methylation at repeats prevents their transposition, their activity as strong promoters and their activity in promoting aberrant recombination. In cancer cells there is usually hypomethylation at intergenic regions and repeats. As a consequence, all the above described inhibitions are removed, and genome instability occurs. In particular, repeats now can transpose themseves, inserting wherever in genome, possibly causing various transcription errors; the presence of identical repeats in two different chromosomes can induce misalignments of chromosomes during mitosis, leading to aberrant recombination; repeats can activate strong promoters, causing over-expression of related genes. As for hypomethylated intergenic regions, they can activate poor promoters, interfering with correct gene transcription.<br />In conclusion, both CpG hypermethylation and genome-wide hypomethylation occur in cells of most experimental and human cancer types. Overall, these biochemical modifications are positively related with cancer time-from-onset, and with cancer severity. Unfortunately, as for a therapy perspective, hyper- or hypomethilation differently prevails in each cancer type, and this balance may reverse at different stages in the same cancer.     </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprint genes are not cleared in early embryonic development. One allele is inherited from the father, the other from the mother, with their own unremoved specific epigenetic marks. Only one imprinted allele is expressed. Expression depends on the presence or absence of methylation in imprint control regions (ICRs). ICR is differently methylated on either allele of the imprinted couple. Imprinted genes are usually grouped in clusters. In the H19/Igf2 cluster, ICR is methylated in the paternal allele. As a consequence, ICR cannot bind CTCF, an insulator protein. Moreover methylation involves the promoter of H19 gene, silencing it. Therefore, enhancer genes, located downstream in the cluster, can activate Igf2, a growth promoting gene. In the maternal allele ICR is not methylated. It binds CTCF, which insulates enhancers from Igf2. Enhancers activate H19, which expresses a long-non-coding-RNA with no role in imprinting. Igf2 is not expressed.<br />In Wilm's tumor the is a loss of imprinting at H19/Igf2 cluster, i.e. epigenetic marks on ICR are removed. The alleles now both behave as the paternal one, with overexpression of Igf2. This is an oncogene, producing a growth factor, essential in prenatal period and infancy. In Wilm's tumor there excessive production of this factor. Moreover, there is silencing of a tumor repressive gene. These factors induce the development of cancer in children.  </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is DNMT1 inhibitor. The process of DNA replication in somatic cells undergoing mitosis ends up in two double-strand DNA. In each of them, one strand is inherited from the parent DNA and maintain all established epigenetic marks. The other is "de novo" synthesized and no epigenetic marks are present. An important mark is methylation on cytosine at CpG islands and elsewhere in DNA. DNMT1 is the enzyme that recognize the unmethylated strand, and methylates cytosine in it, replicating the same methyl marks which are present in the parent strand. Decitabine is a nucleoside analog. It is incorporated in newly synthesized DNA during replication. DNMT1 can bind it, instead of cytosine. The binding between DNMT1 and Decitabine is irreversible. Therefore, many DNMT1 molecules are trapped and the methylation process can be blocked. Consequently, newly formed cells are damaged and cannot survive. Decitabine acts in this way in all cells undergoing mitosis, but it has a some selectivity on cancer cells, since they replicate without control.   </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">A drug altering DNA methylation can have life-long effects. In fact, epigenetic marks are inherited unmodified by daughter cells during mitosis. In case they are altered by a drug or any other agent, they can no longer be repaired.<br />In sensitive periods, nearly all epigenetic marks are firstly removed and then reestablished. Exceptions are epigenetic marks on repetitive elements which are never cleared, presumably because the expression of these genes could lead cells to uncontrolled replication and cancer. Moreover, epigenetic marks on imprint genes undergo clearing and reestablishment only during the second sensitive period (initial gametogenesis).<br />There are two sensitive periods in humans: the first, taking place during the early embryonic development (in blastocyst cells) and the second during the primordial germ cells (PCG) maturation. There is a reason why this takes place precisely in these two periods: zygotes inherit their marks from gametes, where epigenetic control is really different from other cells (just think that gametes are haploid). Therefore, they are removed and resettled differently in the blastocyst. Conversely, during PCG maturation, gametes' epigenetic marks must be restored.<br />An epigenetic drug administered during early embryonic development could alter the correct reprogramming of embryo cells, possibly causing embryo death or abnormal development. The same drug given during PCG maturation could alter gametogenesis, interfering with fertility.      </div>
