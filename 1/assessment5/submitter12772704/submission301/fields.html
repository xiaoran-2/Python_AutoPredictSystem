    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Cpg islands are hypomethylated and intergenic regions, introns and repetitive elements are hypermethylated in normal cell.<br />In a cancer cell reversal of this is observed Cpg are hypermethylated and later are hypomethylated.Therefore for Cpg islands it leads to the problem as tumor
suppressor genes may become silenced, allowing the cell to divide more rapidly, outcompete its
neighboring cells, and grow into a tumour thus creating cancer.<span> Methylation within the promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes causes their silencing, and methylation within the gene itself can induce mutational events</span>. For the latter regions, normally hypermethylation at
these sites is associated with greater genomic stability, so hypomethylation during cancer leads
to copying errors such as deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations in the chromosomes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a cell around HF19/ Igf2 locus we see methylation of paternal allele at ICR and there is no methylation for maternal side.The CTCF complex binds to allele on the  maternal side and the downstream enhancers act on H19 as a result. The CTCF complex
does not bind to the paternal allele due to the methyl marks and it leads to silencing of the H19
gene as the enhancers instead give the expression of Igf2. Thus, in a regular cell we observe a
normal dose of both H19 from maternal strand, and Igf2 from paternal strand. But  when
this ICR becomes hypermethylated, both strands appear to be of paternal origin and get
expressed. That is, the system gets a double dose of (growth­promoting) Igf2 (as well
as no dose of H19). In this way imprinting is disrupted in wilm's tumour.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is a form of regulation which can be manipulated once and the enduring effects remains ensured as DNA methyltransferase enzymes are known to preserve methyl marks during mitosis. Sensitive period is one in which extensive epigenetic reprogramming occurs. However the global interventions do interfere with normal functioning of system especially during sensitive periods. The treatment of patients is inadvisable to pregnant mothers as lots of reprogramming occurs in early childhood development and during the formation of both the gametes male and female.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to DNA methyltransferase inhibitors class and therefore contributes to hypomethylation of DNA. The impact that Decitabine has that it is particularly useful in treating syndrome especially myelodysplatic syndrome in which bone marrow produces deformed blood cells. The syndrome is a precursor of mylogeneous leukemia. D<span>ecitabine takes the place of cytosine at strategic positions on replicating strands of DNA in cancer cells. </span><span>.</span>Decitabine has anti tumor effect also as it had been linked with reactivation of epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor genes which are induced by hypomethylation.</div>
