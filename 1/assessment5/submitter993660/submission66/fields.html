    <h1>Submission 66 from Anon (session_user_id: 663e80b9fa4ed00cb2871f505adc104ae8b2626a)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent, mediating its action through inhibiting DNA Methyltransferase. Decitabine blocks the transfer of methyl groups onto DNA decreasing overall levels of DNA methylation.This in turn can decrease the excessive methylation of tumor suppressor genes which contributes to the growth and survival of the cancer. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to regulate the transcription of genes by controlling the accessibility of the promoters/exons which the islands are commonly located in.Alterations in DNA methylation in cancer are deleterious. An increase in DNA methylation of tumor suppressor genes can lead to lowered expression and thus proliferation or metastasis of tumors.Conversely, decrease in methylation of growth factors  can lead to the unregulated spread of tumors.Normally, DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements serve to ensure that salubrious levels of the gene are expressed despite the high number of gene repeats existing.Methylation ensures that only a select amount of repeats are accessible for transcription.Disrupting this regulation of accessible repeats would lead to higher than normal levels of gene expression and thus possibly growth of a tumor </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">H19 and IGf2 are antagonistic, H19 is a growth supressor while Igf2 is a growth promoter, decrease in H19 leads to probable increase in Igf2.N<span>ormally, only the maternal copy of </span><i>H19</i><span> and the paternal copy of </span><i>IGF2</i><span> are expressed due to imprinting </span>.However, in Wilm's tumor ,<span>both </span><i>H19</i><span> and </span><i>IGF2 </i>typically lose their imprinting .Wilms' tumor cells have shown loss of imprinting of the maternal chromosome and a switch to the paternal pattern of methylation resulting in uncontrolled cell growth and division<br /><br />Citation:<br />Steenman, M. <i>et al.</i><span> Loss of imprinting of IGF2 is linked to reduced expression and abnormal methylation of H19 in Wilms' tumor. </span><i>Nature Genetics</i> <b>7,</b><span> 437 (1994)</span><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA Methylation is mitotically heritable and as such any changes can be passed down from one generation to another through germ cells. A sensitive period is one where extensive reprogramming is occurring in the genome and small changes can have big effects.Sensitive periods of development include <span>post-natal early child development.Treating a patient during such a period may lead to long term adverse changes as methylation would have enduring effects, for example, during early child development may affect their germ cells which could then be transmitted down to the patient's grandchildren. </span></div>
