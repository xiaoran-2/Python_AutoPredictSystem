    <h1>Submission 37 from Anon (session_user_id: c7ed4d0dd4b7b1081b0d21a46d6534a4ac21c647)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a  DNA-demethylating agent that works by<b> inhibiting the activity of the enzyme DNA methyltransfrerase (DNMT)</b>.<br /><br /> This results in the expression of genes that had been silenced by methylation.<br /><br /> If the activated gene codes for a  tumor suppressor, then Decitabine can have anti-tumor effect.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cells, there is hypomethylation of CpG islands and hypermethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br /><br /> In the case of cancer cells, the opposite is found: hypermethylation of CpG islands and hypomethylation of intergeniic regions and repetitive elements.<br /><br />CpG islands are often found in promoter regions of tumor-suppressor genes, so  in  normal cells such genes could be active. In the case of cancer, methylation can silence the tumor-suppressor genes.<br /><br />Hypomethylation of intergenic regions can lead to  genomic instability  due to cryptic transcription ; hypomethylation of repetitive elements can lead to genomic instability due to deletions, insertions or reciprocal translocation. These changes are often evident in tumorogenesis.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the normal  paternal allele, methylation of the Imprint Control region (ICR) blocks binding of CTCF protein. This allows DNA methylation of the paternal gene to spread to the promoter of H19. This silencing allows downstream enhancers to activate lgf2.<br /><br />In the normal maternal allele, the ICR is not methylated so the  CTCF insulator protein can bind allowing downstream enhancers to activate H19 leaving lgf2 inactive.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumor, the ICR of the maternal allele is methylated as well, leading to activation of lgf2 in the maternal and paternal allele. <br /><br />This overexpression of the  growth promoting lgf2 due to the disruption of imprinting is commonly seen early in some cancers and loss of imprinting is common factor in cancer. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">By altering DNA methylation in a somatic cell, the pattern can be inherited mitotically in the cell's descendants; this extends the effect on the epigenome.<br /><br />A sensitive period is a period of development where changes in normal epigenetic programming can lead to abnormalities.<br /><br />Germ cell development and pre-implantation (early) development are sensitive period<br /><br /> Use of drugs that affect methylation during sensitive patterns can produce aberrant conditions such as failure to maintain imprinting. A possible result would be overexpression of a gene. For example, if demethylation is cleared in a primordial germ cell, parent-of-origin designation could be lost and both maternal and paternal genes could be expressed leading to growth disorders.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
