    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In case of a Normal Genome, we see that CpG Islands tend to be hypomethylated and the Intergenic Regions and Repetitive elements are usually Methylated. Whereas, in a Cancer Cell, CpG Islands are found to be Hypermethylated and Intergenic Regions, Repetitive Elements are found to be hypomethylated i.e. a swap occurs on where the DNA Methylation usually occurs.<br /><br />CpG islands usually occur at Tumour Suppressing Genes and in case of a cancer cell, these regions are hypermethylated. As DNA Methylation is a method of Epigenetic Silencing, i,e, it silences the gene, When these regions are methylated (in a cancer cell) , tumour suppressing genes do not work and thus the tumours continue to work. This is considered as one of the many hits in Knudson's Hypothesis for Cancer.<br /><br />Intergenic regions and Repetitive elements which are usually methylated now are Hypermethylated in the case of a Cancer Cell. So they misalign and illegitimate recombination takes place because they are not densely packaged down to Heterochromatin. Also these repetitive elements can be activated now and have to ability to transpose around the genome causing genomic instability.<br />Furthermore, even oncogenes might be activated.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In case of Imprinted Control Regions in cells affected with Cancer, their usual function of showing a monoallelic parent of origin specific expression is not seen. Rather a loss of imprinting is seen and either both parental alleles are expressed together or both are silenced.<br /><br />In the H19/Igf2 cluster, the ICR in the paternal allele is methylated whereas it is unmethylated in the maternal allele. Therefore CTCF binds to it in case of Maternal allele and the enhancers help in producing H19 and IgF2 is silenced. Whereas in the paternal allele, the enhancers directly work on the Igf2 gene and help in its production.<br /><br />When we take the case of Wilm's tumour, the maternal allele is also methylated at the ICR and thus IgF2 is expressed from both the paternal alleles (double dose). Igf2 is growth promoting thus helping in the growth of the Tumour.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA MethylTransferase inhibitors. It is a nuceloside analogue. It gets incorporated into the DNA such that when the DNA Methyl Transferase comes to bind that nucelotide to copy the methylation to the daughter strand, it gets bound to it irreversibly and can no longer be released. This shows that this drug will work on only those cells which are replicating and hence in case of Tumour cells (which are replicating at a large speed) it works properly. However at the start, they were used at high doses but later it was found that they work perfectly at lower concentrations, binding to the DNMT. <br />In many cases of Cancer, there is hypermethylation at CpG islands leading to the disease, therefore by using this the methylation can be reduced thus having an Anti Tumour Effect.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering Epigenetic Machinery might result in a problem because all cells have similar methylation in the genome and therefore if DNA Methylation is altered using a certain drug, unwanted cells will also undergo the change.<span> DNA methylation is a very stable epigenetic mark, which is passed on to subsequent cell generations. </span>Also as epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable, the drugs can have effects beyond the period of drug treatment. <br />A sensitive period,in epigenetics, is described as those periods where the epigenetic makeup is being programmed or being wiped off. In terms of development, primordial germ cell development and the preimplantation period.<br />Treating patients during this period is inadvisable because during this period, new epigenetic marks are being added or being completely removed and hence if this mechanism is disturbed it might not work efficiently and hence the cell might have old epigenetic marks from the parent or would not have proper new epigenetic marks.<br /><br /></div>
