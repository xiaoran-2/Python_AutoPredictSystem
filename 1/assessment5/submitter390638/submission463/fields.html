    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, in paternal allele the H19/Igf2 Imprinting Control Region (ICR) is methylated, so CTCF cannot bind to it, so the downstream enhancers act on Igf2, causing its expression. In maternal allele of normal cells, H19/Igf2 ICR is unmethylated, so CTCF binds to it, and blocks the downstream enhancers from acting on Igf2; instead, they act on H19. As a results, Igf2 is not expressed in the maternal allele of normal cells.</p><p>In cells of Willm’s tumor, H19/Igf2 are methylated in both paternal and maternal allele, so Igf2 is expressed on both alleles. So these cells express twice the amount of Igf2, compared to normal cells. Igf2 is promoting growth, which contributes to the cancer development.<br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, CpG islands are hypomethylated. But in cancerous cells, CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated. Their methylation increases as cancerous cells progress from normal tissue becoming a hyperplasia, then to neoplasia, then to invasive cells. Specific genes affected by this methylation depend on the type of the tumour. The CpG islands methylation in cancer silence tumor suppressor genes, contributing to the cancer development; it is more frequent than genetic mutations causing silencing of the same genes. These epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable, so they stay while the cancerous cells are multiplying.</p><p>Normally, DNA of repetitive elements and intergenic regions is heavily methylated. This supports genome stability, because repetitive elements are too tightly packed (heterochromatin) to cause reciprocal translocations of chromosomes, their cryptic promoters are silenced, and repetitive elements are prevented from being transposed and causing disruption of other genes. But in cancerous cells, there is a genome-wide hypo-methylation of repetitive elements and intergenic regions. This leads to overall genomic instability: increased reciprocal translocations of chromosomes at the long stretches of repetitive elements (as they are now reside in euchromatin), cryptic promoters become active, and transposition of repetitive elects become more prevalent. Also, hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters make them more active, for example, it activates expression on R-RAS oncogene in gastric cancer.<br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an FDA approved drug, belonging to the class of DNA Methiltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors. It is used to treat patients with myelodysplastic syndrome that has progressed to the acute myeloid leukemia. The goal of this drug is to prevent the methylation state of DNA to get replicated to the daughter strand when DNA is replicating during mitosis. Without this drug, DNMT1 (a prevailing type of DNMT in mammals) binds to the parent DNA strand’s nucleotide, to copy the methylation state to the daughter strand. With this drug, DNMT1 is bound irreversibly, so it is prevented from copying the methylation state. </p><p>This causes cells that divide frequently (like cancer cells) to lose methylation. So Decitabine is useful in some cancers that depend on hypermethylation of CpG islands.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, so its effects might stay for the lifetime of the patient. That’s why modification of the DNA methylation by drugs might have effects lasting way beyond the period of the drug treatment, so standard chemotherapy drugs might be more efficient on the cancer cells whose epigenetic state has been modified by DNMT and / or HDAC inhibitors earlier.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are epigenetically sensitive periods, when epigenetic state of the cells of an organism is being cleared, and then reestablished. The main sensitive periods are: early (preimplantation) period of an embryo development (when all cells of the organism undergo epigenetic changes), and a period of primordial germ cell development (when those cells are undergoing epigenetic reprogramming). Using epigenetic drugs on young people, or pregnant mothers whose embryo undergoes a sensitive period, might not be advised, as it could negatively affect the epigenetic state of some cells for life.<br /></p></div>
