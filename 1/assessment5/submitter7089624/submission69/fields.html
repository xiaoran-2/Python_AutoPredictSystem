    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><b>a. </b>CpG islands are usually not methylated regardless of their activity status. DNA methylation at CpG islands usually leads to gene silencing. <b>b.</b> In cancer it is common to find hyper methyilation of CpG island as well as hypomethylation of transpoasable elements and inter genenic region <b>c.</b> Hyper methylation of CpG islands in tumour suppressing genes leads to their inactivation so the cell can grow more or divide more or evade cell death.<b>d.</b> The DNA methylation in repetitive elements and intergenic regions deactivate these regions and stop their expression as they are not supposed to be transcribed in a normal cells.<b> e</b>. In cancer in general there is hypomethylation of  intergenic regions and repetitive elements. <b>f.</b> Disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic region and repetitive elements leads to their expression that cause genome instability for example by increasing transcriptional noise due to alternative start site or transcription of antisense DNA.    <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><b>a.</b> Imprint control region (ICR) is methylated in paternal Allele, and hence,  the CTCF can not attach to this ICR leading to activation of Igf2 enhancers. From the paternal Allele H19 is inactive and not expressed but Igf2 is active. <b>b. </b>In maternal Allele the IRC is not methylated so CTCF attaches to it and activates H19 transcription enhancers leading to expression of H19 from maternal Allele. The IGF2 is inactive in maternal allele. <b>c.</b> In Wilm's tumor both maternal and paternal ICR are methylated so the IFG2 is expressed from two Alleles and H19 is not expressed at all. <b>d. </b>Igf2 is growth promoting and is associated with tumour, in contrast H19 has a negative control over cell proliferation . Lack of H19 and overdose of Igf2 is associated with wilm's syndrome. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><strong>a</strong>. Decitabine belongs to group of drugs called DNA-demethylating agents. <strong>b.</strong>  Decitabine inhibits the action of DNA transferase and hence decrease overall DNA methylation. <strong>c.</strong> In some form of cancers hypermethylation and subsequent down regulation of so called tumour suppressive genes can lead to survival and growth of cancers. Hypermethylating agents such as Decitabine decrease the methylation and hence stop / decrease the speed of tomourogenesis process.   <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, so the daughter cells will have the methylation patern of the mother cell but when the methylation is actively removed it will not come back in subsequent generation of cells.  Demethylation agents remove the excessive DNA methylation, and hence, change epigenome of cancer cells and these changes are heritable so the subsequent generation of cancer cell may be more susceptible to chemotherapy for example or grow slower. Sensitive periods are the times during the life spam of individuals when the epigenome is removed and then re-established. The first epigenetic sensitive period is during pre-implantation early development period and the second phase is during the primordial germ cell development in mid-gestation embryo. During the sensitive periods there are removing and then re-setting of epigenetic marks and if we disrupt epigenetic reprogramming It may lead to serious developmental abnormalities in first or second generation. Basically it is not advisable to to use epigenetic desruptive drugs before or during pregnancy.    <br /></div>
