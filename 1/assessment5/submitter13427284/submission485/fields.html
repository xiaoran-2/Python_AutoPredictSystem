    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Cytosine is methylated at position 5 in the normal DNA. It is the basis of different epigenetic phenomena. In cancer CpG island are found in 60% in promoterrs that are hypermethylated which  leads to sliencing the gene. In intragenic region the methylation cause high gene activity and transcription can be start from different alternative start sites, which inhibit os modofy the splicing of RNAs. DNA methylation represent a stong epigentic mark and regulates the expression of a gene and the compartmentalization os the chromatin. Incancerous cells the DNA methylation include genome wide loss and regional gain, which lead to silencing the tumor suppressor genes by hypermathylation of their promoter. CpG island are hypermethylated in colorectal cancers. The heterogenity of methylation in tumors can be the explanetion for the selective advantage of tumors.   </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a peternal allel when the ICR region is methylated than the transcription occures in the Igf2 gene, but not from H19,inhibits H19 expression. In the case of a mother when the ICR region is not methylated than the transcription occures in the H19 gene, Igf2 is inhibited. Igf2 is neccesary for growth, but when it is overexpressed the cells can't be contolled. They begin to proliferate. H19-derived micro-RNAs play an important role in proliferation. They can inhibit th effect os Igf2. When an optimal quantity H19 is in the cells than the Igf2 is under the regulation of H19, leading to a normal proliferation patten.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belong to <span> DNA-demethylating agents. Cuts off the methyl groups from the cytosine. It can heva anti-tumor effect by elterning the tumor cells to be sensitiv to chemotherapy.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The sensitive periods are the early development and PGC development phase. In early development when the embryo is formed in the progenitor germ cells are sensitive to alternations in the epigenetic marks, because the are erased and will be reestablshed, but when something goes wrong then the marks can't be the same. In sensitive period a treatment like this is inadvisable because some genes can be active that in normal cells are silenced. This alternation can lead to cancer, when the cells have active genes, which can stimulate proliferation etc.</div>
