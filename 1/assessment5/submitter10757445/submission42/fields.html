    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is the
addition of a methyl (-CH3) group to the DNA. In mammals DNA methylation happens
almost exclusively at Cytosins that are followed by Guanin (CpG dinucleotids). These
dinucleotides are found in certain places throughout the genome - CpG islands,
often at promoters of genes. Methylation is unlikely to occur at CpG islands,
but if so - this means the gene expression is being silenced. DNA methylation
is an inactive epigenetic mark.<span><br /><br />
The
global level of methylation decreases as you progress from a normal tissue
through to a metastatic tissue. At the same time methylation at some CpG
islands becomes more dense. This progression (as we go through from normal
tissue to hyperplasia, to neoplasia and then invasive tissue) in terms of these
DNA methylation markers allows us to detect if there is a tissue with
cancer (we compare it to normal cells) or if the tissue is metastatic.<br /><br />
There are
two types of DNA methylation abnormalities in cancer - locus specific DNA
hypermethylation and genome-wide DNA hypomethylation. In a normal cell the CpG
islands are usually hypomethylated. In cancer cells those
regions are in general methylated. CpG islands are found in the promoters of
tumor suppressor genes. The CpG island hypermethylation is equivalent to
silencing of those genes.</span></p>

<p>The normal cell genome in general is methylated in the
repetitive elements, intergenic regions and introns of genes. However, at a
cancer cell those regions are<span>
hypomethylated which can result in genomic instability. Illegitimate recombination between repeats can occur because they are not densеly packaged down into heterochromatin. The repeats can be activated due to hypomethylation - they can make a copy of themselves and transpose. This can lead to activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes. The results are additional deletions, translocations or insertions in cancer.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Cancer cells display loss of imprinting. Imprinted genes become either expressed from both parental alleles or silent from both parental alleles. The imprint control region of the H19/Igf2 cluster is normally unmethylated on the maternal allele and methylated on the paternal allele. On the maternal allele CTCF binds the imprint control region and the enhancers are then able to act on H19 (Igf2 is silent). On the paternal allele CTCF doesn't bind the imprint control region - the enhancers act on Igf2 so it is expressed.<br />However, with loss of imprinting the imprint control region on the maternal allele is hypermethylated so both the paternal and maternal alleles express Igf2. The dose of Igf2 is doubled and this is assosiated with Wilm's tumor.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is DNA-demethylating agent and one of the epigenetic drugs for treating cancer on the market. It reduces the amount of histone overmethylation and the proliferation of tumor cells but has no effect on normal cells.<br />It is thought that the effect epigenetic drugs have on tumor cells is lasting and makes them more susceptible to standard treatment. Epigenetic changes can be mitotically inherited until they are actively erased. This means that epigenetic treatment can stop the tumor from growing without having any negative effect on normal cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">There are genomic regions, associated with distinct DNA methylation patterns regulating gene expression and chromatin compartmentalization. In cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which causes silencing of the underlying gene. Gene body methylation is present in highly expressed genes and it is believed that this may repress transcriptional noise from alternative start sites, inhibit antisense transcription or direct RNA splicing and relates to replication timing. <br /><br />DNA methylation is stable epigenetic mark that is mitotically heritable. However, reprogramming of DNA methylation occurs during germ cell development and in early preimplantation embryonic development <span>or after artificial reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells</span>. These periods are called sensitive because the epigenome is accessible to outer impact and patients should not be treated during these periods.</div>
