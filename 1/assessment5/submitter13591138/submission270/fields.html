    <div class="field-value">Normally DNA methylation at CGIs silences genes, which mustn't be expressed.<br />But in cancer cells the CGIs of tumour-supressor genes are often hypermethylated, so they won't impair the tumour.<br />On the other hand, the CGIs of oncogenes are hypomethylated, which often results in activation of these.<br />In the end this leads to overexpression of oncogenes, while tumour-supressor genes are not expressed, so the tumour will grow much faster and the tumour cell will not or only rarely undergo apoptosis, which gives the tumour an advantage over normal cells, which then leads to the domination of cancer cells in the tissue.<br /><br />Normally intergenic regions and repetetive elements are silenced to ensure that transposons inbetween genes won't translocate themselves, thus damaging the genome and to suppress the binding of repetetive elements on different chromosomes, which would lead to illegemate recombination.<br />Unfortunately intergenic regions and repetetive elements are hypomethylated in cancer and thus all the events, which where formerly supressed by methylation of these locations, occur.<br />For example illegemate recombinations, transposons destroying exons or activation of neighbouring genes through cryptic promotos.<br />In short the hypomethylation of repetetive elements and intergenic regions leads to genomic instability.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cells on the paternal allel ethe ICR (imprint control region) and H19 is methylated, so no insulator protein can bind to the ICR, thus the enhancers act on Igf2 and it gets expressed, while H19 doesn't.<br />In the maternal allele on the other hand the ICR is not methylated, thus an ICR can bind to it and insulate the Igf2 gene lying upstream against the enhancers, thereby the enhancers act on the H19 gene and it gets expressed, while Igf2 doesn't.<br /><br />In a Wilm's tumour the maternal allele shows the same methylation pattern as the paternal allele, while the methylation pattern of the paternal allele stays the same.<br />So the ICR of the maternal and paternal allel, as well as H19, is methylated and the enhancers act on the Igf2 gene, as no insulators can bind to the ICR. This leads to overexpression of Igf2 and no expression of H19.<br /><br />The overexpression of Igf2 supports cancer, as it is a growth promotor, which gives cancer an advantage in comparison to normal cells, as it will supersede normal cells over time.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">As decitabine is a "DNA-demethylating [agent]" (l.52) it should belong to the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi).<br /><br />Decitabine should lower the methylation levels found in CGIs, as the DNMTs couldn't lay down any supressive marks anymore and therefore maybe activate the tumour-supressor genes, but they have to cautious as to which cancer in which stadium they are treating, as different tumour in different stages are dependent on different requirements.<br /> <br />A drug inhibiting DNMTs should be great for tumours dependent on silencing tumour supressor, because then the tumour supressors could become active again and impair the cancer cell, but the drug could also enhance tumorigenesis in tumours dependent on illegemate recombination.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and thus the effect the drug had on the cancer cell would be passed onto the successor cells and be maintained there, unless DNMT1 doesn't exsist in the mother cell, which could be desirable to clean all methylation marks on the tumour-supressor genes.<br /><br />A sensitive period is a period in which epigenetic reprogramming occurs.<br />Two sensitive periods of developement in an embryo would be during primordial germ line developement and the other would be during the pre-implantation period. Of course there exist other sensitive periods, but most of them are tissue specific and don't have an impact on the whole genome.<br /><br />Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable, as all the tissue that is affected would inherit these changes to the successor cells probably for the rest of the patient's life, thus making him affected for the rest of his life.<br />The aforementioned sensitive periods should be especially avoided, as these affect either all the tissues or the patient's gametes and thus his/her children.<br /><br /></div>
