    <div class="field-value">In the normal cell CpG islands (found at gene promoter regions) do not normally exhibit DNA methylation, they are unmethylated. However in a cancer cell CpG islands have often become hypermethylated. Increased DNA methylation in these regions causes transcriptional silencing in the related gene(s), resulting in decreased gene expression which may contribute to cancer. For example hypermethylation of CpG islands in a tumour suppressor gene causes silencng of that gene and loss of tumour suppressor function. <br />In contrast intergenic regions and repetitive elements in the normal cell are hypermethylated, effectively silencing and therefore stabilising these regions of the genome. However in cancer cells these regions become unmethylated, leading to genomic instability which contrinutes to cancer in a number of ways. Decreased methylation and so decreased silencing of repetitive elements may lead to transposition (transcription and insertion) of these elements into important genes such as tumour suppressor genes, causing disruption in the transcription of these genes therefore leading to loss of tumour suppressor function. It is also possible that hypomethylation at CpG poor promoters results in activation of an oncogene(s). Geneomic instabilty also results in structural abberations such as chromosome tranlocations, illegitimate recombinations, deletions and insertions leading to the abnormal karyotype seen in cancers. <br /> Together hypermethylation at CpG islands and genome wide hypomethylation result in silencing of one or more tumour suppressor genes in addition to increased genomic instability and activation of oncogenes, leading to a cancerous phenotype.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The H19/Igf2 cluster contains an ICR which is normally methylated on the paternal allele where Igf2 is expressed, and unmethylated on the maternal allele where H19 is expressed. <br />On the paternal allele methylation of the ICR blocks binding of CTCF preventing formation of an insulating region, meaning downstream enhancers can act upon the IGF2 gene and Igf2 protein is expressed. ICR methylation also causes methylation and therefore silencing of H19 gene on this allele. On the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated and so CTCF molecule binds to the ICR effectively insulating the Igf2 gene from downstream enhancers, preventing Igf2 expression from the maternal allele. Unmethylated ICR allows active transcription of the H19 gene now acted upon by the downstream enhancers.<br />In Wilm's tumour hypermethylation at the ICR on the maternal allele prevents CTCF from binding, meaning Igf2 gene is no longer shielded from downstream enhancers and is instead expressed the same as the paternal allele. Igf2 is therefore expressed from both parental alleles leading to overexpression of Igf2 (which is involved in growth) and development of Wilm's tumour.<br />Many ICRs are anvolved with growth therefore disruption of imprinting often contributes to cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to a class of epigenetic inhibitors called DNA-demethylating agents and is FDA approved for use to treat MDS progressing to AML. This class of drugs acts by irreversibly binding dna methyltransferase enzymes (DNMTs). As a DNA-demethylating agent Decitabine treatment would result in irreversible binding of DNMT and progressive dna demethylation over subsequent cell divisions, particularly effective in rapidly dividing cancer cells. Since hypermethylation of CpG islands of tumour-suppressor genes and therefore silencing of these genes is a common finding in tumours, removing this hypermethylation may contribute to an anti-tumour effect by re-activation of tumour suppressor genes. In combination with histone-deacetlylase inhibitors, DNA-demethylators have been shown to slow tumour progression. These drugs act systemically however at low doses decitabine is known to be effective in cancers where dna hypermethylation is a hallmark, exhibiting limited side effects for the patient.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Once DNA methylation is altered it is mitotically heritable therefore maintained through cell divisions for a lasting period of time, until they are actively erased. This mitotic heritability of DNA methylation is responsible for it's enduring effects on the epigenome.<br />A sensitive period in epigenetics is a period when the epigenome is undergoing active remodelling with epigenetic marks being removed and replaced, such periods exist during early embryo formation and again in primordial germ cell development. During this period the epigenome is particularly vulnerable to insults which can have lasting negative effects not only in the immediate organism but for multiple generations where germ cell development is effected, with possible transgeneration epigenetic inheritance.<br />Treatment of patients with drugs targeting the epigenome during periods of epigenetic remodelling would be a huge environmental insult that could lead to disrupted x-inactivation in the early embryo, disrupted imprinting in the primordial germ cells, or loss or gain of epigenetic marks genome-wide. This is of particular concern in younger patients where primordial germ cells are still developing, since action of these drugs is systemic and may effect any cell type. <br /></div>
