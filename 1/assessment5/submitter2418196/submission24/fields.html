    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands in the normal
cell are normally hypomethylated, allowing expression of their associated promoter
regions and products, e.g. tumor suppressor factors.</p>

<p><span>In cancer, CpG islands are
hypermethylated leading to lack of  expression of tumor suppresors.</span></p>

<p>DNA methylation of
intergenic regions and repetitive elements suppresses the expression of those
regions.</p>

<p><span>DNA methylation may “spread”
to active regions and suppress expression of tumor suppressors.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Disruption
of parental imprinting is one of the proposed causes of Beckwith-Wiedeman
syndrome which causes multiple systemic problems as well as being associated
with the development of  nephroblastoma
(Wilm’s tumor) and other neoplasms.  BWS
is associated with excess production of insulin-like growth factor (Ifg2). </span></p>

<p>Paternal imprinting is
brought about by the methylation of the H19 region of the paternal allele. This
methylation prevents binding of CTCF and allows enhancers to stimulate expression
of Igf2.</p>

<p>In
the maternal allele, H19 is not methylated which allows binding of CTCF and
blocking of the enhancers of Igf2 and hence suppression of Igf2.</p>

<p><span>In
Wilm’s tumor and BWS syndrome, imprinting of the paternal allele is disrupted
by methylation of the maternal allele which allows expression of Igf2 by both
alleles- a “double dose” of Igf2 results. 
</span></p>

<p>This
excess of Igf2 can lead to neoplastic growth of kidney cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine
is a DNA-demethylating agent.  It is
proposed that hypermethylation of some DNA regions causes the lack of
production of tumor suppressor factors. 
By  decreasing methylation,  expression of tumor suppressor factors would
be promoted hence having an anti-tumor effect.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>

<p><span>Effects that last beyond
the period of drug treatment can occur because patterns of DNA methylation have
been shown to be mitotically heritable i.e. the methylation pattern is passed
on with cell division and growth of cells. 
In plants and some animals methylation has been shown to be her<span>itable across generations.  </span></span></p>

<p><span>Sensitive periods of
development are those times where active demethylation and methylation of the genome
occur.  <span> Demethylation of the genome of the zygote
must occur to remove the genetic marks that resulted in the functional specialization
of the gametes (sperm and oocytes).  This
causes the cells to become pluripotent cells from which specialized cells and
tissues of the organism can develop. 
Methylation of the genome occurs as cells differentiate and
specialize.  </span></span></p>

<p>The
two periods of demethylation/methylation occur 1) in early gestation (up to the
blastula stage and
2) during development of the primordial germ cells in mid embyogenesis.</p>

<p><span>Treatment
during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because the genome is unstable
and undergoing rapid changes during these periods.  Treatment could potentially have much more
profound and general effects on the genome during these periods.</span></p></div>
