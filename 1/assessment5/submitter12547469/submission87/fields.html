    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are found a<span>t
the promoters of genes where the transcription machinery binds. They are usually hypo-methylated in normal cells. Methylation of CpG islands stops transcription in almost all cases and the gene is silenced.  </span>Silencing of most genes in normal cells is usually achieved by epigenetic markers on the histone tails, rather than methylation of the CpG islands. However, DNA methylation of CpG islands is found in X-inactivation.</p><p>In cancer cells some CpG islands are fund to be hypermethylated and this hypermethylation can spread to the CpG island shores. CpG islands at the promoters for tumour suppressor genes are found to be the most frequently hypermethylated. This is the case in almost all cancers, though it can be different tumour suppressors in each type, and it is more frequent than genetic mutation. This means that the hyper-methylation is mitotically inherited and in all daughter cells the tumour suppressor genes are silenced and the tumour suppressing proteins are not produced. These tumour suppressors are required to promote cell death and reduce proliferation. In their absence the cell continues to divide rapidly. CpG island methylation increases with time, </p><p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated in normal cells. This ensures that the chromatin is compacted and the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are not transcribed or active. </p><p>In cancer cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated, the chromatin can then unwind and the repetitive elements can cause genomic instability through illegitimate recombination resulting in translocations. insertions and deletions. Repeats can also make a copy of themselves and become inserted into the genome randomly - this can disrupt the coding of a gene or can activate transcription of a gene. </p><p>         </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer cells display loss of imprinting, the ICRs can be hypo- or hypermethylated to control either activation or inactivation of the gene through different mechanisms. The ICR for lgf2 works by disabling enhancer blocking. Igf2 is paternally imprinted - the ICR is methylated on the paternal allele so CTCF cannot not bind to the ICR - methylation can spread from the ICR to silence production of H19; without the CTCF the downstream enhancers can loop to the Igf2 locus and promote transcription.</p><p>On the maternal allele the ICR is hypomethylated which allows CTCF to bind to the ICR, effectively blocking the action of the enhancers on lgf2 and promoting production of H19 instead.</p><p>With loss of imprinting, hypermethylation on the maternal allele leads to double expression of Igf2; the maternal allele behaves exactly as the paternal allele. Igf2 is growth promoting; having twice the volume results in Wilm’s tumour which is kidney tumour that occurs in children.</p><p>

</p><p><span>BWS is caused by loss of imprinting and results, as in Wilm's tumour, with 2 copies of the paternal allele. This causes loss of Cdnq1c which is a tumour suppressor or growth suppressor and u</span><span>p-regulation of Igf2 which is an  oncogene (growth promoting).</span></p><p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decatibine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi). </p><p>Decatibine is a nucleoside analogue that binds DNA methyltransferases after it is incorporated into the DNA, making the DNMT unavailable to methylate DNA any further. As the cells replicate, the DNA methylation is reduced as the daughter strand cannot be methylated in the absence of the bound DNMT. This reduces the methylation and its' consequent silencing of tumour suppressor genes.</p><p>The exact mechanism is not known but the removal or DNA methylation re-activates tumour suppressor genes; the tumour suppressors limit cell life and replication, thus reducing tumorigenesis. Decatibine is effective in myelo-displastic tumours if used in low doses earlier in the treatment.</p><p><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><br />DNA methylation is mitotically heritable due to the action of DNMT1 and therefore will be replicated in every daughter cell. <br />A sensitive period is a period in which epigenetic marks are reprogrammed. <br />The sensitive periods of development are a) during the pre-implantation period, after the sperm and oocyte come together the paternal DNA is rapidly and actively demetheylated and the maternal DNA is passively demethylated - but demtheylation is complete by the blastocyst stage and b) during primordial germ cell development when the epigenetic marks on a somatic cell need to be removed and the epigenetic signatures required for germ cells are laid down.<br />Treating patients during sensitive periods will have an effect on the progeny and on the patient's own developing germ cells.</div>
