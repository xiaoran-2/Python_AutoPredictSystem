    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine
is a nucleoside analogue that is incorporated into the DNA during replication
and acts as a DNA-demethylating agent by irreversibly binding to DNMTs <span>(Santi et al., 1984)</span><span>. This DNMT inhibition leads to DNA
hypomethylation and thus re-activation of silenced tumour suppressor genes. </span><span></span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-gb" xml:lang="en-gb">Sensitive
periods are moments when exposure to an external factor, such as a drug, has
the most impact on the epigenome. These periods occur during moments of
epigenetic reprogramming, like early embryonic development and primordial germ
cell development. A DNA- demethylating agent could affect <em>de novo</em> methylation
and the maintanence of imprinted regions during early development, leading to neoplastic
tumours. During germ cell development, hypomethylation could prevent the
establishment of imprinted regions, which would have a detrimental effect on the offspring. Because DNA methylation is a mitotically
hereditable epigenetic mark, any drug-induced change in the DNA methylation is
maintained through cell division. For this reason, young patients could be
considered to be in a sensitive period, and the long terms effects of the epigenetic
drug on normal cells should be taken into account before settling for this kind
of treatment.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;

    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;

the H19/Igf2 cluster in the paternal allele is methylated, so it can’t bind the
insulator protein CTCF and a downstream enhancer can activate the <em>IGF2 </em>gene. On
the other hand, the maternal allele’s ICR is unmethylated and able to bind the CTCF
protein, so the downstream enhancer can’t act on the <em>IGF2 </em>and the gene is not
expressed. </span>In Wilm’s

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-gb" xml:lang="en-gb">DNA
methylation has an important role in many epigenetic phenomena like imprinting,
X inactivation and the formation of heterochromatin </span><span lang="en-gb" xml:lang="en-gb"><span>(<a href="#_ENREF_1" title="Hassler, 2012 #266"><span style="text-decoration:none;">Hassler and Egger, 2012</span></a>)</span></span><span lang="en-gb" xml:lang="en-gb">. It’s associated with gene
silencing, so it’s generally considered a repressive epigenetic mark. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-gb" xml:lang="en-gb">CpG islands
are CpG rich regions found in about 60% of promoters </span><span lang="en-gb" xml:lang="en-gb"><span>(<a href="#_ENREF_1" title="Hassler, 2012 #266"><span style="text-decoration:none;">Hassler and Egger, 2012</span></a>)</span></span><span lang="en-gb" xml:lang="en-gb">. In normal cells, they are
generally unmethylated (with some exceptions, such as imprinted genes and silenced genes in the inactive X chromosome). <span> </span>However, in cancer cells, CpG islands are
found to be hypermethylated. This causes deregulation of tissue specific and
imprinted genes and silencing of tumor suppressor genes, favouring tumour
growth.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-gb" xml:lang="en-gb">DNA
methylation at intergenic regions helps maintain genomic integrity by silencing
cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites. Silencing of
repetitive elements by DNA methylation also increases genomic stability by
preventing transposition and the transcription of cryptic promoters. It also
leads to compaction of the chromatin, which helps prevent illegitimate
recombination between repeats. In cancer cells, there’s genome-wide global hypomethylation
at intergenic regions and repetitive elements </span><span lang="en-gb" xml:lang="en-gb"><span>(<a href="#_ENREF_1" title="Hassler, 2012 #266"><span style="text-decoration:none;">Hassler and Egger, 2012</span></a>)</span></span><span lang="en-gb" xml:lang="en-gb">. This leads to an overall genomic
instability characterised by deletions, insertions and reciprocal
translocations.</span></p>
