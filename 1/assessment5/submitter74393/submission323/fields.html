    <h1>Submission 323 from Anon (session_user_id: a34a15c9c38f03f2f0c825cc8cf77f43e52769ee)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNMT1 maintains the methylation marks on DNA by adding methyl groups to the unmethylated strand in hemimethylated DNA. Decitabine inhibits DNMT1 leading to the passive demethylation of the DNA over cycles of replication. Although the detailed mechanism is not yet known, it is believed that inhibiting the methylation of the rapidly replicating cancer cells can demethylate the CpG  islands of the 5' regulatory portion of the tumor suppressor genes, in effect increasing their expression and as a result they can perform their function of managing cellular growth.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation state is mitotically conserved because enzymes such as DNMT1 copy the methylation template of the original strand onto the newly synthesized strand of DNA during replication. Sensitive periods are times during the develeopment cycle during which the epigenetic state is undergoing significant adjustment, for example, to attain a pluripotent state. The sensitive periods for mammals are early embryonic development and primordial germ cell development. It is not advisable to treat patients during a sensitive period because of the complexity of the modification of the epigenetic state, the full details of which remain unknown. While much of the activity involves removal of epigenetic marks, retention of of a set of special marks such as imprinting marks is critical for proper function of the cells. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The H19/Igf2 locus is imprinted and has different behavior on the paternal and maternal alleles.On the paternal allele, the imprint control region is methylated, which prevents the binding of the CTCF insulating protein. In the absence of CTCF, methylation extends to the 5' regulatory part of the H19 gene silencing it, Therefore, down stream enhancers activate the Igf2 gene. On the maternal allele, the imprint control region is not methylated and CTCF binds. The downstream enhancers then act on the H19 gene activating it and the Igf2 gene is inactive.In Wilm's tumor, hypermethylation leads to methylation of the maternal imprint control region, as well as the paternal one, so both alleles express the Igf2 gene and the result is overproduction of Igf2. This example illustrates how disruption of the imprinting can support the development of cancer. Igf2 is a growth factor, so increasing its level can trigger the unregulated growth associated with cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">While 80% of the CpG sites in the genome are methylated, CpG islands in the 5' regulatory section tend to be unmethylated for most genes, whether they are expressed or not. Methylation of the CpG islands generally leads to silencing of the associated gene. Dysregulation due to cancer development can lead to hypermethylation of the CpG islands and silencing of genes, especially tumor suppressor genes. Alternately, hypomethylation of the promoter of a silenced gene can lead to its expression, such as for the case of oncogenes. Cancer can disrupt DNA methylation through mutations in epigenetic maintenance genes (e.g. DNMT3 and DNMT1), changes in nuclear architecture, or changes in chromatin packing.<br /><br />Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are part of the 80% of the genome that remain consistently methylated to keep these elements compacted into heterochromatin so they are inactive. Cancer generally leads to a global hypomethylation that loosens the packing of intergenic regions and repetitive elements thereby introducing genetic instability due to inappropriate recombination and activation of transposons or cryptic promoters, Hypomethylation of these regions opens up the chromatin leading to genomic instability. Again, cancer can disrupt DNA methylation through mutations in epigenetic maintenance genes (e.g. DNMT1), changes in nuclear architecture, or changes in chromatin packing.<br /></div>
