    <div class="field-value">A common feature of cancer cells is to display aberrant DNA methylation at specific sequences into the genome inducing alterations of its normal function of gene expression regulator.<br />In normal cells, methylation at CpG islands at gene promoters is associated with gene silencing. Housekeeper genes usually do not show methylation in that regions.<br />However, in cancer this mechanism of silencing goes wrong and often occurs at oncosupressor genes (a class of genes which inibihit cell division, normally active in normal cells) that shown hypermethylation at CpG islands thus inducing silencing and facilitating the uncontrolled proliferation of the cells.  <br /><br />Intergenic regions  and repetitive elements normally shown DNA methylation.<br />The first ones may contain cryptic promoters and cryptic splicing sites which otherwise can interfere in the normal transcriptional activity.<br />Repetitive elements like IAP sequences need to stay methylated to ensure genomic stability. In other case they can transpose them into the genome and may cause genetic/genomic mutations. <br />Furthermore their strong promoters can induce overexpression of the neighbouring genes. <br />Cancer cells are charachterized by genome wild hypomethylation and CpG islands hypermethylation which progress with time and they are associated to tumorigenesis. <br />The main features of cancer cells like genomic instability and overexpression of oncogenes are related to loss of DNA methylation<br />at repetitive elements and intergenic regions.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>The espression of  Igf2 is mediated by imprinting control regulation.<br /></span>On the maternal allele, the ICR is not methylated and it can be bound by the insulator CTCF. <br />When CTCF is bound to the ICR, the enanchers located into the downstream of the cluster will not bind Igf2 (therefore will not enhance its transcription), rather, they will enhance transcriptio of the nearest H19 gene.<br />On the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated and CTCF can not bind in this site. Morover methylation on this allele is spreaded out and interest H19 too, so then the enhancers will enhance only Igf2.<br />Hypermethylation of ICR can distrupt imprinting at this cluster. In this case the ICR of the maternal allele will be methylated and therefore both alleles will express Igf2.<br />This gene promotes growth and its overexpression is associated with the insurgency of Willm's tumour.<br /><br /><b></b></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a <span>DNA-demethylating agent, it targets DNA methylation.<br />This drug is a cytosine analogue, it can act after its inclusion into the DNA (in the new strand, during DNA replication), therefore when the DNMTs recognise the C base to perform methylation the reaction leads to the irreversibily tied of the enzymes and also their function is inhibited.<br /></span><span>Decitabine displays anti-tumour effect because it can disrupt DNA methylation associated with tumour suppressor genes and also their abnormal state of silence. By switching on their expression it can be induced inbition of cell growth.<br /></span><span><br /><br /></span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark characterized by mitotic <span>heritable and the maintance of its pattren during lifetime.<br />The mitotic heritable is ensured by DNMT1. The substrates of this enzyme are hemi-methylated DNA strands, and it acts inducing DNA methylation. <br /></span><span>This kind of epigenetic mark are normally resetted between generations to restore totipotency. There are two periods of massive epigenetic reprogramming: the first one occurs during pre-implantation period in early development, the second one, during primordial germ cell development (gametogenesis). Both this period are very sensitive to environmental conditions and the presence of drug which can interfere the normal DNA methylation and may cause alteration which can be mitotical and also meiotical heritable. In this case modifications can be inherited in the offspring.<br /> <br /></span></div>
