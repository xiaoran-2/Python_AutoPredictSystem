    <h1>Submission 497 from Anon (session_user_id: 4a10f3cd95c1e4b24794a8313bc6abb88cf3f8c0)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylase. Cancer is - in general terms - associated with locus-specific hypermethylation leading to hypermethylation of CpG-islands and CpG-shores in promoter regions and, thus, decreased gene expression. In cancers where tumor suppressors genes play a role, such a decrease in expression may lead to promotion of the cancer. Another frequent finding in cancer cells is genome-wide hypomethylation, resulting in increased activity of transposons and normally inactive elements and thus increased genomic instability that may lead to progression of the cancer. Both hypo-and hyper-methylation may lead to loss of imprinting via interaction with ICRs.</p><p>Demethylation may thus, in particular cancers with a characteristic cell biology (i.e. specific tumor suppressors) have a positive effect on the cancer disease, as it may result in increased tumor supression. However, such an effect is most likely dependent on each particular cancer type. As seen for Decitabine that is useful against MDS.     </p><p><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at CpG islands inhibit gene expression. In normal cells, promoter associated CpG islands and -shores are hypomethylated, whereas CpG islands in intergenic regions and repetitive elements and transposons are heavily methylated, protecting against activity that might disrupt genomic stability. In cancer, the typical picture is hypermethylation at locus-specific promoter sites (which may be associated with reduced gene expression of tumor suppressor genes) and global hypomethylation leading to increased genomic instability. The concrete significance of these changes depend on the individual cancer type, and possibly also the degree of development and differentiation. Likewise, changes in methylation may differentially influence the activity of imprinting control regions (ICRs), resulting in changes in e.g. growth factor expression. These effects are most likely different in different cancers depending on the particular pathobiology. This is reflected in the differential cancer-type specific effect of drugs interfering with DNA-methylation.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">On the paternal allele the H19 promoter asssociated ICR is hypermethylated leaving the igf2 gene availabe for expression as enhancers are not inhibited. On the maternal allele the lack of methylation at H19 makes it possible to inhjibit igf2 expression through the interaction with CTCF, inhibiting enhacers of igf2 gene expression. Thus, igf2 is not expressed. In Wilms tumor the maternal allele is also methylated at the ICR in apposition to H19, resulting in the abolition of inhibition of enhancers of igf2 expression. Thus, in Wilms tumor, boh alleles Express IGF2, which is a growth factor. Thus, disruption of the imprinting at the H19/igf2 cluster may result in increased synthesis of a growth factor, supporting the growth of certain - but not all - tumors. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altered DNA methylation is seen in cancer. Combined locus-specific hypermethylation and global hypomethylation, may play a role in the etiology of cancers. Probably in different ways in different cancers, as the involvement of tumor suppressors and genomic instability and aberrant growth factor production may differ between cancer types as a function of the particular molecular pathobiology. As methylation changes are frequently mitotically inheritable, changes in methylation induced by drug treatment may be perpetuated in a particular tissue and dispose for the development of or reduced risk of cancer. A sensitive period is a period where reprogramming occurs, i.e. in very early development and in gametogenesis. In these periods the changes in methlation are very extensive, so any interference with this process may have dramatic global consequences - e.g. large-scale effetcs on gene-expression -  for the organism. In consequence, treatment with methylase influencing drugs cannot be recommended in pregnancy.</div>
