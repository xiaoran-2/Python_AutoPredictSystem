    <h1>Submission 195 from Anon (session_user_id: 08c63d5ba4c7fa89b616ee9325c938b018f98812)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a demethylating epigenetic inhibitor which is FDA approved and mostly used to treat hematological malignancies. It is incorporated into the DNA, then when DNMT tries to replicate the methylation on the daughter strand, it becomes permanently bound. It relies on replication, which can mean that cancer is affected more than normal cells as it has a higher rate of replication. With less DNMT available, there is less methylation, which can be very effective when dealing with hypermethylation as found it many cancers. How it fully works is still unclear, but it is assumed it is most effective on blood cancers as they seem to be reliant on hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes. By demethylating these, normal production can help suppress the tumor. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are normally unmethylated in the majority of the genome. A small number will be found methylated, but this is dynamic and based on cell type, and this helps the cell to function in its specific way. However, in cancer CpG islands are far more likely to be hypermethylated. This is often found in the CpGs at the promoters of tumor suppressor genes, and is theorised to be one of the 'hits' taken in Knudson's hypothesis. Methylating a CpG island silences the following gene, and the silencing of tumor suppressor genes can result in large tumor growth.  It is found in nearly all tumor types studied, and found frequently. Given the increased growth rate, it is more likely to be selected for, as the methylation of the islands is mitotically heritable. <br />Another example of DNA methylation aberation in cancer is the methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements. These are usually methylated in normal cells. The role of this methylation is to silence elements that cause genomic instability, and thereby maintain integrity. However these are hypomethylated in cancer, which leads to increased genomic instability, resulting in deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations in the chromosomes. The lack of silencing can activate the repeats and transpositions, which can affect other areas of the genome which are then interrupted. This is found in every tumor type as an early event, and progresses with time. Due to this hypomethylation, the genome will get more and more corrupted and unstable, which can in turn affect other elements like tumor suppressors or activate oncogenes. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a normal version of the H19/Igf2 cluster, Igf2 will be expressed from only one copy, and H19 from the other. This is because the paternal allele shows methylation in the Imprint Control Region. The enhancers then act on Igf2, as H19 is methylated. The maternal allele ICR is unmethylated, meaning the enhancers act on H19, leaving Igf2 unexpressed. However, cancers often show differences in ICRs, whether hyper- or hypomethylated, meaning that either both are expressed or silent. This is common in growth factors in cancers. In Wilm's tumor, both alleles are methylated, like the normal paternal allele. This results in two versions of Igf2 being produced, which being growth promoting, excess can drive the growth of the tumor.  </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is carefully preserved when replicating cells, and any epigenetic effects would endure thanks to transcription. When drugs are used to change methylation, the state at transcription will be replicated, and this can lead to, for example, a decrease in methylation if a demethylating drug such as Decitabine is used. There are two main sensitive periods which should be avoided when giving any medication to affect epigenetic change. These periods are when imprinted marks are cleared and relaid, and are vital for normal function due to parental specific imprinting. The first of these is early embryo developmenty,particularly at the blastocyst stage, before implantation. The second is during germ cell development, from primordial germ cells in the foetus to maturation. Demethylation for example at these periods would be inadvisable as it could lead to incomplete methylation of normal cells which could cause amongst other problems, imprinting disorders which severe consequences for life. </div>
