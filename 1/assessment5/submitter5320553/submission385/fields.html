    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value">Normally, CpG islands are usually unmethylated, only a small subset are methylation, but are largely protected from methylation. The methylation CpG leads to silencing of a gene. It can lead to the inhibition of tumor suppression, contributing to the cancer phenotype. CpG becomes unusually methylated, or hypermethylated in cancer, and it characterizes CpG island methylator phenotype cancers. Furthermore, methylation of CpG is mutagenic, its occurrence may decrease genomic stability.<br /><br />Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated, they become hypomethylated in cancer. Methylation is maintained in the intergenic region to prevent cryptic transcription start site and cryptic splice sites. Repetitive elements are prevented from spurious transposition, and illegitimate recombination by methylation. These are mechanisms which help maintain genomic stability. There is a genome wide loss of methylation in cancer, and without methylation, these regions drives genomic instability.<br /><br />Methylation pattern can also be used to epigenetically diagnose, and prognosticate cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The paternal allele is methylated, hence it is imprinted, while the maternal allele is unmethylated. The methylation on the paternal allele leads to insulator blocking, so that Igf2 is allowed to be expressed on the paternal allele. The Igf2 is silenced on the maternal allele because enhancers are blocked due to insulator interaction uninhibited by methylation, but binds to H19 instead. These also cause different expression from each parent upstream (such as a growth suppressor, Cdkn1c, causing Wilm's tumor).<br /><br />Hypermethylation of both the paternal and maternal allele, leads to an over-expression of Igf2, which is an oncogene. The loss of imprinting is common within cancers. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyl-transferase inhibitor. It binds strongly to the target molecule, DNMT in this case, to prevent its action. The drug is a nucleoside analogue, which means that it gets incorporated into the DNA. It then irreversibly binds to DNMT during DNA replication, preventing its release. This has the most effect in quickly dividing cells, such as in cancer cells, where replication is more frequent. It alleviates hypermethylation in cancer, because the transferase molecules become inhibited.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Sensitive periods include the early embryo development, and before the onset of puberty when the gametes are starting to mature. These are times when environmental, care, and chemical exposures can affect formation of epigenetic marks. These are usually times which coincide with the clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks (first for imprinting, then for the setting of gametes) in the normal course of development of a complex animal.<br /><br />During sensitive periods, epigenetic marks are still plastic (according to mouse models, and evidence from data on mothers' diet), so that changes in methylation by the treatment will persist into the adult by mitotic heritability of epigenetic marks. When the epigenetic marks are changed in the maturing/sensitive gametes, it can affect the health and viability in offspring, in a form of transgenerational epigenetic change carried by the gametes.  The risk is higher to health and reproduction during epigenetically sensitve developmental period.<br /><br />The write-up here is based on the reading listed above, and the lecture notes for this course.<br />Epigenetic Control of Gene Expression on Coursera by Dr. Marnie Blewitt<br />(2012, April 7) Cancer's epicentre.
