    <h1>Submission 351 from Anon (session_user_id: 4dd0faa80b7a40fa837c61835d3239cfe9c2a5af)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable.  DNA methylation altered during drug treatment
could last beyond the drug treatment
period, either temporarily or potentially permanently, in daughter cells of treated
parent cells.  Perhaps the drug treatment
is insufficient to impact the cancer alone, but the reduction in overall DNA
methylation and increased activity of tumor suppressors that is inherited from treated cells, may allow traditional
chemotherapeutic agents to be more effective.  A sensitive period is a developmental time
sensitive to environmental epigenetic factors, such as during germ cell
development and pre-implantation development. 
The epigenetic changes made by treatments likely affect more than just
the tumor cells and may well affect all other tissues, therefore it would be
inadvisable to treat patients during sensitive periods as the epigenetic mark
changes could have broad and long-lasting affects, not only within the patient’s
lifetime via adverse side affects, but transgenerationally.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the DNA de-methylating
agent class of epigenetic inhibitors and inhibits DNMT.  A mechanism of action, though possibly not the only one, is that Decitabine is incorporated into the DNA during replication and when DNMT binds, it is bound
irreversibly and can’t be released to continue laying down methylation in daughter cells.  Tumors may have heavily methylated DNA in CpG islands in promoter regions, inhibiting expression of tumor
suppressor genes and leading to uncontrolled cell growth and tumor
formation.  Decitabine inhibits DNA
methylation during replication and promotes expression of tumor suppressor genes, stopping the uncontrolled cell growth and tumorigenesis. <br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are found in promoter regions and are not usually
methylated, however, when they are methylated, the normal function is to
silence gene expression.  In comparison,
DNA methylation in intergenic and repetitive regions is common and is important
in maintaining genomic stability by silencing cryptic splice and transcription
sites, preventing transposition, silencing strong promoters and preventing
illegitimate recombinations.  In cancer,
this methylation pattern is flipped.  CpG
islands tend to be highly methylated (hypermethylation), while intergenic and
repetitive elements tend to be less methylated (hypomethylation). </p>

<p>As previously noted, CpG islands are often found in promoter
regions.  In cancer, hypermehtylation is
found near promoters of tumor suppressor genes, which will lead to silencing or
inactivation of these genes and then to the uncontrolled cell growth necessary
for tumorigenesis   In cancer, DNA in intergenic and repeat
regions is hypomethylated, leading to genomic instability.  With DNA hypomethylation, it is common to see
insertions, deletions and translocations of chromosomes, and this chromosomal
instability is a hallmark in many cancer types and leads to tumorigenesis.  Of note is that DNA in the CpG region of
oncogene promotors is also hypomethylated, leading to increased expression of
oncogenes that promote tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>According to Abramowitz and Bartolomei, the maternal and paternal H19/Igf2 cluster share enhancers. The H19/Ifg2 imprint control region (ICR) is
unmethylated on the maternal allele, allowing binding of the CTCF insulator protein, which represses Igf2 gene expression by insulating it from the enhancers, therefore allowing H19 gene expression.  On the paternal allele, the H19/Igf2 ICR is methylated, CTCF binding is repressed, and the H19 promoter is
silenced through methylation spreading, allowing expression of the Igf2 gene. 
Consequently, imprinting causes the H19 gene to be expressed maternally and the Ifg2 gene to be expressed paternally.</p>

<p>In Wilm’s tumor, the maternal methylation pattern in some
cells is changed and becomes identical to the paternal pattern, in other words
there is a loss of imprinting. Therefore, H19 expression is severely reduced or
eliminated and Igf2 expression is significantly increased.  Many imprinted genes are related to cell growth and increased expression of Igf2 leads to abnormal, increased cell growth.  Briefly, H19 acts as a tumor suppressor (restricts growth) while Igf2 acts as an oncogene (promoting growth) and the loss of H19 expression and increased Igf2 expression that occurs when imprinting is disrupted leads to increased
cell growth, tumorigenesis and cancer. </p></div>
