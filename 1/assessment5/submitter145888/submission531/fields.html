    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at CpG islands tends to create heterochromatin, therefore silencing the affected genes.  This does not always apply to promoter regions, which have a high CpG density and are usually free of methylation (and therefore free of silencing). However, in cancer, the pattern is reversed. Overall  methylation throughout the genome tends to decrease, but at CpG islands, there tends to be a hypermethylation leading to silencing of cancer suppression genes and permitting the altered cancer cells to develop into neoplasia and invasive cells. The disruption of normal DNA methylation at CpG islands also contributes to cancer by creating a genomic instability, especially among  the tumor suppressor genes mentioned above. This instability also stretches to depletion of repressive histone marks. The island hypermethylation also creates CIMP cancers--where sets of genes become methylated, although this differs by tumor type.<br />During normal functioning of the cell, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated, where the CpG islands are unmethylated. Where it does occur, it can silence transcription start sites through deletions, reciprocal translocations and insertions. At the repetitive elements, methylation suppresses transposition and mutations to preserve genomic integrity. In cancer,  intergenic regions and repetitive sequences show reduced methylation (part of the overall genomic hypomethylation characteristic of cancer). In part, this leads to loss of imprinting in normally epigenetically imprinted regions as will be seen in the next question.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">On the paternal allele, the lgf2 gene is expressed and the downstream ICR and H19 gene methylated. On the maternal allele, the lgf2 factor is not expressed as CTCF keeps the ICR unmethylated and the H19 gene activated. The paternal allele will express lgf2 with the maternal allele counterbalancing its effect. In Wilm's tumor, both alleles have an ICR methylated along with the H19 gene. Thus, the lgf2 gene becomes hyperexpressed, which leads to loss of suppression of tumor growth restricting genes and overexertion of growth promoting genes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent, whose purpose is to inhibit the activity of mutated forms of the enzyme EZH2. Overactive forms of the enzyme overmethylate the histones and contribute heavily to the silencing of tumor-suppressing genes located around the affected histone tails. This drug is used to treat precursors of myelogenous leukemia and works by reducing the methylation in the area of the suppressor genes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic changes, such as methylation, are mitotically heritable and so will last the lifetime of the individual. In addition, the removal of epigenetic changes during early gestation can be incomplete and therefore passed down through generations. Thus, methylation patterns that are not completely erased during the sensitive periods of epigenetic reprogramming (early development stage and germ cell development) can lead to intergenerational changes. In addition to these two sensitive periods, adolescents experiencing puberty pass through a third sensitive phase of development. During these sensitive phases, the effects of epigenetic reprogramming can have uncertain effects as a result of environmental or systemic insults, including treatments for cancer and other disorders. </div>
