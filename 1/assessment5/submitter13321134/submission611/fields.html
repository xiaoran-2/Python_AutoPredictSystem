    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are found at transcription start sites and are usually devoid of DNA methylation independently of gene activity state. Sequences at CpG islands are adapted for promoter function - they are able to create transcriptionally permissive chromatin state (REF: <a href="http://www.genesdev.org/cgi/doi/10.1101/gad.2037511">doi:10.1101/gad.2037511</a>)<span>.<br /></span><br />CpG islands which are usually devoid of methylation are found usually hypermethylated in cancer.<br /><br />This leads to inactivation of tumor suppressor genes.<br /><br />DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements is associated on one hand with chromosomal structural stability and on the other hand keeps transposable elements (LINEs, SINEs) in repetitive sequences silenced.<br /><br />In cancer DNA is usually globally demethylated and this affects mainly intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br /><br />This leads to structural and genomic instability. DNA demethylation increases activity of transposable elements which in turn leads to genomic instability.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">On the paternal allele CTCF insulator binding site is methylated, CTCF does not bind and this allows a distant enhancer to activate Igf2 expression.<br /><br />On the maternal allele CTCF insulator binding site is unmethylated, CTCF binds and this prevents a distant enhancer to activate Igf2 expression, in turn it activates proximal H19 expression.<br /><br />Loss of imprinting results in overexpression of Igf2 (growth factor, favoring tumor growth) and inhibition of H19 (a tumor supressor) on the maternal allele.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine of 2-deoxy-5-azacitidine is inhibitor of DNA methyltransferases.<br /><br />When incorporated in DNA 5-azacitidine cannot be methylated because on 5th position in the pyrimidine ring it has nitrogen which cannot be methylated. It inhibits all DNA methyltransferases but inhibition of meintenance methylase DNMT1 leads to passive demethylation over successive cellular divisions.<br /><br />This demethylation leads to reactivation of tumor suppressors which are frequently <em>de novo</em> methylated and inactivated in cancer.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is inherited during cellular divisions, it is a major mechanism of epigenetic inheritance and alterations of DNA methylation are also inherited. The mechanism of inheritance relies on the DNMT1 maintenance DNA methyltrasferase, after DNA replication it scans DNA for hemimethylated sites and restores their full methylation state.<br /><br />Sensitive periods are periods of establishment of epigenetic states which are then inherited during the life time of the organism. Environmental influences during these periods may have major impact on epigenetic state establishment and thus major impact on health of the organism during its whole life.<br /><br />Epigenetic resetting/reprogramming after egg fertilization and during primordial germ cell development for establishing the parental genome impring marks.<br /><br />Treating patients during sensitive periods may alter establishment of epigenetic states and thus alter the health status of the individual or its offspring (children, grandchildren).  <br /><br /></div>
