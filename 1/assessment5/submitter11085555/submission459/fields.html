    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are frequently found at the promoter regions of genes, they are usually unmethylated; in this state transcription machinery can attach and activate transcription, the gene is expressed. In the methylated state, the gene is silenced. Methylation usually results in binding of MeCP1/2 to the promoter, repressing transcription. Dynamic DNA methylation of CpG islands is key to controlling mitosis by switching on/off the oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes (TSGs).<br />Cancer results from uncontrolled cell division by continuous activation of oncogenes and/or inactivation of TSGs. Hypermethylation of CGI within the promoters of Tumour Suppressor Genes results in gene silencing leading to continuous cell division. Over time CGI methylation increases in cancerous tissue, in metastatic tissue CGI methylation is extremely high and may spread to the CGI shores.  CGI hypermethylation of single genes include RB in retinoblastoma and BRCA1 in breast cancer, whilst hypermethylation of large sets of genes result in CIMP cancers such as neuroblastomas.<br /><br />Repetitive elements and intergenic regions are normally methylated; this is to protect the genome and maintain genomic integrity. Methylation at the intergenic regions prevents chromosome deletions or insertions, chromosome duplications and translocations between chromosomes; it may also silence cryptic start sites or cryptic splice sites. Methylation of the repetitive elements prevent transposition of repetitive elements, mutations of repeats (MeC to T thus a genetic mutation), transcriptional interference from strong promoters and illegitimate recombination between chromosomes. Cancer shows progressive hypomethylation of these regions resulting in genetic instability. Repeats may activate and copy themselves and then jump around the genome resulting in disruption to neighbouring genes as well as activation of cryptic promoters. The repeats may line up on non-homologous chromosomes causing illegitimate recombinations. Genomic instability is one of the hall marks of cancer caused by hypomethylation of the repetitive elements and intergenic regions.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Many imprinted genes code for growth promoters or growth inhibitors. Hypo or hypermethylation at the ICRs can lead to silencing or over expression of these growth promoting genes. In most cancers both parental alleles of imprinted genes are silenced or both expressed. H19/Igf2 is a growth promoter which is over expressed in Wilm's tumour (a childhood kidney cancer)<br /><br />In normal cells the ICR for Igf2 is unmethylated on the maternal chromosome but methylated on the paternal chromosome. In the maternal allele an insulator protein CTCF binds to the ICR preventing downstream enhancers binding; instead the enhancers access H19 which is then expressed. On the paternal allele the ICR for Igf2 is methylated which blocks the binding of CTCF insulator protein, methylation spreads to the promoter of H19, silencing it. The enhancers now access Igf2 (by chromosome looping), which is then expressed.<br /><br />In Wilm's cancer both the maternal and paternal allele are methylated. This prevents the CTCF insulator protein binding which in turn leads to the expression of Igf2 by allowing the downstream enhancers to access the Igf2 gene. So both alleles are expressed, a "double dose" of Igf2 results in early development causing excessive growth of the kidney cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the class of drugs known as DNA demethylating agents (Hypomethylating agent).<br />Decetabine is a DNMT inhibitor preventing methylation of the new DNA strand during the S phase of cell division. It is a nucleoside analogue which becomes incorporated into the DNA on replication. DNMT copy the methylation marks onto the DNA daughter strand, but irreversibly bind to the analogue thus preventing further DNA methylation. Further DNA replication will result in hypomethylation at CGIs, repetitive elements and intergenic regions with consequential loss of epigentitic markers to regulate gene expression . The effect of DNMT inhibitors is greater on cancer cells since they replicate more frequently. The precise mechanism of action is unclear since hypomethylation can occur across the genome. The effective use of Decitabine for MDS maybe because this malignancy is dependent on tumour suppressor gene hypermethylation, so demethylation would reactivate the tumour suppressor gene, halting cell division, <br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation marks are mitotically heritable, but also reversible. After DNA replication DNMT1 together with UHFR1 protein, copy the methyl marks onto the cytosine residues of the daughter DNA, maintaining epigenetic marks in daughter cells. Thus drugs that alter DNA methylation would be copied and have enduring effects on the genome after drug treatment provided DNMT remained active.<br />A sensitive period is when epigenetic marks (such as DNA methylation) are cleared and reprogrammed. Two sensitive periods occur in humans both during pregnancy: firstly early embryonic development from conception to the epiblast stage, and secondly during primordial germ cell development, around mid gestation.<br />It would be inadvisable to treat patients during sensitive periods since the resetting of epigenetic marks is made in a cell specific manner resulting in somatic cell differentiation and development of the embryonic tissue in a regulated, sequential way.  DNA methylation at CGI is important in silencing genes and causing inactivation of one of the X chromosomes. Interference at this early embryonic stage could result in gross abnormalities or cause a termination of pregnancy. Similarly interference in the laying down of DNA methylation marks during primordial germ cell development has the potential to affect the next generation.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
