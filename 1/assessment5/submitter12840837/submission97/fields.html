    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell CpG islands are not normally methylated (expect for inactive genes) whereas in cancer cells hypermethylation of CpG islands is found and tends to increase over time. CpG methylation during cancer normally targets genes which express tumour suppressor proteins. This silences these genes which can potentially lead to the cancerous cell out competing neighbouring healthy cells. Different types of cancer may hypermethylate a different tumour suppressor gene (MLH1 in colorectal cancer or BRCA1 in breast cancer) or set of genes.  This hypermethylation can then be mitotically inherited to  create other cells with inactive tumour suppressor genes leading to tumour formation. This increase in CpG island methylation can also be observed as a person ages. <br /><br />In contrast, in normal cells methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements is quite common (to maintain genomic stability and to silence genes, respectively) while there is hypomethylation of these areas in cancer cells. This happens early in tumourogenesis and as with hypermethylation of CpG islands, hypomethylation of intragenic and repetitive islands increases over time in cancers. This hypomethylation of repeats leads to increased genomic instability which in turn can lead to transposition, illegitimate recombination and the activation of cryptic promoters. This can affect genes which are related to tumour suppression or growth leading to tumour formation. The hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters in the intergenic regions can result in the activation of their associated genes, some of which may lead to decreased expression of tumour suppressor genes (for example the microRNA miR21 targets PTEN in glioma).  </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The parental imprint control region of the <span>H19/Igf2 cluster is normally methylated leading to the production of Igf2 due to the fact that H19 is not produced which leads to enhancers driving Igf2 expresion. On the maternal allele this region is unmethylated leading to CTCF binding. This then leads to the production of H19  and the silencing of Igf2 on the maternal allele. <br /><br />During Wilm's tumour formation, both the maternal and paternal imprint control regions are hypermethylated, leading to both alleles expressing Igf2. This means that the cell is getting a double dose of Igf2 which acts as a growth promoter and allows the cell to grow at a faster rate than neighbouring cells. This epigenetic mutation is then mitotically inherited by its daughter cells, leading to tumour formation. </span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent which is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes. Decitibane acts as a hypomethylating agent by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. Decitabine is structurally similar to cytosine and can be incorporated into host DNA.  However, unlike cytosine the carbon-5 is substituted by nitrogen meaning that when DNA methyltranserases covalently bind to the DNA they are unable to unbind. As well as preventing the enzyme from functioning, this also leads to its degradation due tot he triggering of DNA damage signals. This means that the progressive increase in silencing of  tumour suppressor genes located in CpG islands would not take place.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is able to be transmitted mitotically to daughter cells leading to long terms effects in the affected tissue, thereby any cell which had altered DNA methylation would be able to transmit this to its daughter cells. Sensitive periods where alterations in DNA methylation are more possible are defined as periods where epigenetic reprogramming is taking place. These periods include germ cell development and pre-implantation development (until blastocysts form into epiblasts). Treating patients with drugs which cause epigenetic alterations would therefore be inadvisable during these sensitive periods as it is possible that epigenetic mutations could be passed on through the generations. It would therefore be inadvisable to treat pregnant women with these drugs as during the early stages of pregnancy epigenetic modification levels are high in the developing embryo and later in pregnancy the foetus may be developing germ cells and epigenetic changes could therefore have an impact down through 3 generations. It may also be inadvisable to treat teenagers who may also be developing germ cells.</div>
