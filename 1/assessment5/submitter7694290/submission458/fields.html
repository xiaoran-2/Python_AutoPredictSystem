    <div class="field-value">Normal function of CpG island methylation is to provide silencing of gene expression. In cancer cells observed CpG island hypermethylation, while in normal cells these sites are hypomethylated. This leads to silencing tumor supressor genes in cancer cells promotes them to grow in the accelerated rate.<br />Normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements provides chromosomal stability, prohibiting homological exchange of genetic material between chromosomes, disallowing delitions, duplications, invertions and insertions and restrains movement of transposons in the genome. In cancer cells observed hypomethylation of DNA in intergenic region, while in normal cells these cites are hypermethylated. Hypomethylation of DNA intergenic regions and repetitive elements provides highter mutation rate (deletions, duplications, translocations, insertions and ivertions) and allowing transposons to walk around genome.<br /><br /><br /><br />P.S.

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><a href="http://www.endocrineconnections.com/content/1/2/87/F1.large.jpg" title="Link: http://www.endocrineconnections.com/content/1/2/87/F1.large.jpg">http://www.endocrineconnections.com/content/1/2/87/F1.large.jpg</a> <br />Reviewing cancer we can't ignore H19/Igf2 cluster. This cluster has the difference between the sexes. So this cluster are patternaly imprinted : it has methylation marks <br />at the ICR so the insulator protein CTCF can't bind to that site. In this way downstream enchansers can bind to the igf2, promoting it expression. Besides that methylation at the ICR on paternal allele spread DNA methylation, methylating downstream to H19 promoter.<br />In maternal allele there were no methylation marks observed in the normal cells. In that allele insulator protein CTCF bind to ICR insulating igf2 from downstream enchancers and that leads to enchancing expression of H19. <br />In Wilm's tumor H19/igf2 cluster from maternal allele looks like paternal allele : patients have methylation at ICR site and it lead to the doble dose of igf2 gene, which is an oncogene and promotes division of addicted cells. In other hand these patients doesn't have any copies of Cdkn1c gene, which is an tumor suppressor gene It restrains excessive division of cells.<br /><br /><br /><br />P.S.

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to DNA methyltransferase inhibitors <br />Decitibine cause DNA hypomethylation. It incorporates into the DNA upon replication and covalent bind with DNA methyltranferase when these ezyme try to copy a methyl mark on the daughter strand. <br />Thus cancer cells, which devide much faster then normal cells, will suffer from DNA hypomethylation, which will lead to cell deth, while normal cells, which devide not so fast, can fix these problems during interfase.<br /> <br /><br /><br /><br />P.S. Sorry for my bad english.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can lead to hypomethylation or hypermethelation of various sites in genome which could affect expression state of various genes which responsible for malformations and cancer, increase the number of mutations and transposons, jumping around genome. The most dangerous period for taking epigenetic drugs - sensitive period. Sensitive periods are periods when all epigenetic marks in cells are removed and then reestablished in growing cells. It happens during pre-implantational period in early development, when erasing of epigenetic marks start in zygote and new epigenetic marks establish in blastocyst, and during primordial germ cell development, when new epigenetic marks were erased and established to form germ cells.<br />Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter cells so it can lead to various disfunctions in growong cells. Considering that in these periods all epigenetic marks are erased and newly established it all can lead to various mailformations and disfunctions of genes.<br /><br /><br /><br />P.S.
