    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation found at a CpG island normally acts to silence the expression of the gene with which it is associated. This is because it leads to a recessive chromatin structure via one of two mechanisms. In cancer, CpG islands which are normally unmethylated can be methylated - hypermethylation occurs. This can lead to silencing of the gene instead; in the case of a tumour-suppressor gene, this allows cell growth and division to accelerate, hence tumourigenesis begins. <br />DNA methyation that is found in intergenic regions and at repetitive elements serves to maintain genomic integrity, i.e. it silences these regions of DNA to prevent their transcription, transposition and illegitimate recombination. These events could otherwise disrupt the genome and cause cancer. Therefore, in cancer, hypomethylation of these intergenic regions and repetitive elements is seen, which leads to this genomic instability. Since heterochromatin does therefore not form, repeats can make copies of themselves and 'jump' around the genome, possibly inserting themselves into exons. Hence, frame shifts occur and genes are disrupted. Tumour suppressor genes may be disrupted in this way, which will therefore be inactivated. Also, neighbouring genes can be activated, possibly leading to the expression of oncogenes.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">On the paternal allele, the imprint control region (ICR) of the H19/lgf2 cluster is methylated, which leads to the activation of lgf2<em>.</em> This is because the insulator protein (CTCF) is unable to bind to the methylated imprint control region, and so cannot act to 'insulate' lgf2 from the enhancers that lie downstream of the ICR. On the maternal allele, however, the ICR is not methylated, allowing CTCF to bind to it. Hence, the enhancers loop to the long non-coding RNA known as H19 instead, enhancing its expression. Meanwhile, lgf2 is not expressed.<em><br /></em>In Wilm's tumour, both alleles are methylated and so both act as paternal alleles. This could occur following a mutation in the sequences required to maintain the imprinting on the maternal allele or could be due to uniparental disomy. As a consequence, the patient will recieve a double dose of lgf2 protein; lgf2 is an oncogene, and so its upregulation will lead to accelerated cell growth and division - cancer. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the class of epigenetic inhibitors known as DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. Decitabine is incorporated into the DNA upon DNA replication and binds irreversibly to the DNA methyltransferase enzyme (DNMT1). This means that the DNA is effectively demethylated as the methylation process cannot occur. Therefore, the tumour suppressor genes which would otherwise have been silenced via methylation cannot be methylated. This gives an anti-tumour effect, since the tumour suppressor genes can become active, and so rate of cell growth and division is reduced, i.e. tumour growth is reduced.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, and so persists from one cell to its daughters and to these cells' daughters, etc. This is due to the effects of DNMT1, an enzyme involved in laying down methylation on the daughter strand of DNA following DNA replication. Hence, if the level of DNA methylation on the chromosomes found in a target cell is altered by a drug, when it divides the 'new' level of methylation will be maintained via this enzyme's action. <br />A sensitive period is a time period during which the genome is undergoing epigenetic reprogramming; epigenetic marks are being cleared and reset. Such periods would be primordial germ cell development and the pre-implantation period of early development. It would be inadvisable to treat patients during sensitive periods since the laying down of epigenetic marks (such as DNA methylation) in the patient's developing primordial germ cells could be affected, and the subsequent changes would be maintained. Hence, the offspring of the patient would be at a greater risk of developing cancer themselves, due to disruptions in the egg/sperm cells' epigenetic reprogramming.<em></em></div>
