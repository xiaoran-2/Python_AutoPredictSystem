    <div class="field-value"><pre></pre><code></code>CpG islands are Cytosine-phospate-Guanine rich sequences in the genome, usually located in gene promoters, that control their transcription. Thus, Cytosine methylation in CpG islands is usually linked to gene silencing, whereas demethylated CpG islands are indicative for gene transcription. In general, the methylome of somatic cells displays high methylation of intergenic regions, repetitive elements and gene bodies, but low methylation of CpG islands of active genes. Hypermethylation in gene bodies and intergenic regions is necessary to maintain genomic stability by silencing possible cryptic promoter sequences, whwereas hypermethylation of repetitive elements ensures the silencing of transposons such as LINEs and IAPs.<br /><br />
However, cancer cells are found to suffer a deep switch in their DNA methylation profile, characterized by low methylation in intergenic regions, repetitive elements and gene bodies, but an overall high methylation in CpG islands. This switch in DNA methylome is linked to increased genomic inestability due to the activation of transposons and cryptic promoter sequences within intergenic regions and gene bodies. Also, genomic hypomethylation allows illegitimate recombination between repeats and activation of CpG poor promoters that may control the expression of oncogenes. On the other hand, the increased methylation in CpG islands is related to silencing of tumor supressor genes that normally control the cell cycle. <br /><br />Overall, these disrupted methylation patterns contribute to aberrant epigenetic disregulation of cancer cells, including loss of imprinting, that allow them to bypass the epigenetic mechanisms that limitate their cell division.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprinting is characterized by the monallelic specific expression due to allelic differential methylation in sequences known as imprinted control regions (ICRs). In the paternally imprinted H19/Igf2 cluster, the paternal allele but not the maternal allele shows methylation at the ICR. This methylation at the ICR acts blocking the binding of a protein insulator element called CTCF. Without the binding of CTCF to the methylated ICR, enhancer sequences located 3' downstream are free to loop and bind to the promoter of Igf2 and activate its transcription only in the paternal allele.<br /><br />In the maternal allele, the ICR is however demethylated and thus the insulator element CTCF can bind to this sequence. With CTCF bound to the ICR, the 3' downstram enhancers can not loop to interact with the Igf2 promoter and thus they activate the H19 promoter instead, resulting in H19 expression from the maternal allele.<br /><br />In some types of cancer such as Wilm´s tumor, hypermethylation of this cluster in both alleles blocks the binding of CTCF to the ICR in the maternal allele, resulting in up-regulation of Igfr2, which is a gene related to cell growth and thus allows preneoplasic cells to grow in a fast and uncontrolled fashion.<br /><br />  </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-mehtyl-transferase (DNMT) inhibitor. It is a nucleoside analogue that is incorporated during DNA replication to the new DNA strand and irreversibly binds to DNMT1 blocking its function of adding methyl groups in accordance to the original DNA strand template. As a result, new DNA strands loose methylation marks upon replication, and thus cells treated with this drug loose methylation upon cell divisions.<br /><br />Since cancer cells divide more rapidly than other cells, Decitabine has an stronger effect on these cells than in the rest of th body. In this way, inhibition of DNMTs can induce the demethylation of CpG Islands that where initially methylated in cancer cells, allowing the re-activation of the genes that they control, including tumor supressor genes. This is especially important in non-solid tumors that are dependent on tumor supresors silencing by CpG hypermethylation.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation marks are inherited by doughter cells after cell division thanks to the action of DNMT1, which adds methyl groups to the new DNA strand during replication using the original strand as a template. In this way, since doughter cells inherit the DNA mehtylation from their parental cells, any change in DNA methylation induced by drugs can have effects beyond the period of treatment.<br /><br />In general, this rule is true in the tissues of mammalian organisms during almost all their lifespan. However, there exist two so called "sensitive periods" in the life cycle of mammalian organisms during which the epigenome is reseted and reprogrammed almost completely. The first epigenetic reprogramming occurs during primordial germ cells (PGC) development in the fetus and comprises the deepest epigenetic reset including gene imprints in order that gametes acquire the imprinting corresponding to their sex. The second occurs during preimplantational embryonic development and allows the very specialized epigenome of gametes to acquire an epigenetic profile to form a new individual.<br /><br />Thus, the use of drugs that alter DNA methylation in patients during sensitive periods when profound epigenetic reprogramming is occurring may result in drastic side effects due to the accumulation of epimutations.<br /><br /> </div>
