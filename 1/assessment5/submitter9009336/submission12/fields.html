    <div class="field-value"><div> DNA methylation of promoter regions is frequently described as a silencing epigenetics mark and depends on the level of gene expression, while 60% of of promoters found are CpG islands don’t depend, and they are normally being un-methylated. It was discovered that methylation at CpG islands become more dense from normal through hyperplasia, neoplasia to invasion tissues. So, at cancer-cells they were often found hypermethylated, which means silencing the underlying genes. Intra-genic methylation is found at repetitive sequences, representing regulatory sites of differential gene expression during the early stages of lineage specification. </div><div> Changes in DNA methylation causes genome instability, misregulation of different gene expression, silencing tumor suppressing genes, and causing many other alterations. Another target of aberrant DNA methylation in cancer are CpG island suburbs, located  approximately 2 KB up- and downstream regions surrounding CpGs. Such situation was observed in different tumor cell lines and nerve sheath tumors, and in particlar in colorectal cancer, while in healthy tissues they must represent regions of tissue specific methylation. There is also a particular tumour type called CpG island methylator phenotype, CIMP - hypermethylation of sets of genes, it has higher levels of CpG island  hyper-methylation than is usually seen in cancers. It was described for colorectal cancer, glioma, more recently for neuroblastoma and others.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>

    <div class="field-value"><div> Decitabine, commercial name Dacogen, is epigenetic drug, FDA approved, produced by a Japanese company Eisai. Class :antineoplastic or cytotoxic. Pregnant category D. Chemically, it is a cytidine analog. The  impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation is DNA hypo-methylation by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. And it’s used to treat a class of conditions where certain blood cells are dysfunctional, myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. </div><div><br /></div><div><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytidine">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytidine</a></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div> A period of epigenetic reprogramming, when the clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks are made, the period primordial cell development, happening at the very early stage is the most sensitive period, it is generally believed that early life constitutes a period during which there is increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms, which we’ve learnt also contributes to future generation development. Children definately shouldn’t take it, since it can effect their future children. We also lack studies oflong-lasting effect of this kind of intervention. However studies on mice shown that experiences during sensitive periods of development influence DNA methylation patterns of several genes and these experience-induced DNA methylation patterns represent stable epigenetic modifications that alter gene transcription throughout the lifespan and promote specific behavioral outcomes. </div><div> It would be inadvisable treating young population, since is not enough evidence that it’s safe and won’t lead to wrong outcomes in the 2nd half of their lives, we dont know long-lasting side-effects. Some studies were done on mice, but unlike mice people live longer, we lack studies being done on people, since it's rather new. I also believe that it would vary from patient to patient and will need the individualized approach.<br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>With hypermethylation of IGF2H19 ICR region on both paternal and maternal allele there will be the expression of Igf2. So it will be the double expression. Or it can be fully silenced with hypomethylation, since enhances won’t be able acting We won’t get IGF2 being expressed at paternal allele, as it should. </div><div><br /></div><div> Since in cancer either hypermethylation or hypomethaltion can take place in ICRs causing the loss of  imprinting. It means that genes no longer show this imprint of expression but rather become either expressed from both parental alleles or silent from both parental alleles, this way becoming growth promoting or growth suppressing. </div></div>
