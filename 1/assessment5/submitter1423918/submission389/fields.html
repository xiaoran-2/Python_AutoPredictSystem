    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, CpG islands
tend to be protected from DNA methylation and so they remain unmethylated leaving the gene without this specific gene supresing epigenetic mark.</p><p>It has been found through various studies that in cancer cells it’s more likely to find this CpG islands methylated. This particular epigenetic mark, a locus specific DNA hypermethylation causes the silencing of the gene, which means that the molecule codified in this gene will not be expressed due to this supresor mark. It's important to take into account that which CpG islands are methylated is very dependent on the tumour type. This particular hypermethyltion is a good biomarker for detecting cancer cells because DNA methylation is more sensible and it's easier to detect than hypomethylation. </p><p>When the gene affected is, for example, a tumour suppressor the methylation of its CpG island silences or inhibits this particular gene which leaves the cell more vulnerable to suffer disseases releated to growth dysregulation like cancer. This can be one hit in the Kudson hypothesis which stablish that several hits in epigenetic regulation have to occur for a normal cell to undergo cancer.</p>

<p>In normal cells
the repetitive elements, the intergenic regions and the introns are methylated. This genome wide methylation is usually an inactive mark.</p><p>On the other hand, in cancer cells this parts of the DNA are unmethylated
which leads to genomic instability that might lead to cancer development. Some
of the outcomes of this genomic instability are recombination between repeats, activation
of repeats and transposition, disruption of neighbouring genes, activation of
cryptic promoters, among others. </p><p>In some regions like at CpG poor promoters this hypomethylation, less common than in repeats, can result in activation of oncogenes.</p><p>Overall it's important to notice that the role of DNA methylation is context dependent and stage specific.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/IGF2
cluster is paternally imprinted. The paternal allele has a methylated ICR and
thus CTCF, an insulator protein, cannot bind to it and this leads to expression
of Igf2 by action in trans of the enhancers. There is downstream spreading of
DNA methylation from the ICR to H19 promotor which leads to its silencing.</p>

<p>In the maternal
allele the ICR is unmethylated and thus CTCF can bind to it. This insulates
Igf2 from downstream enhancers which means it is not expressed. Now the
enhancers are acting over the H19 gene which means it will be expressed.</p>

<p>In Wilm’s tumour
there appears to be a loss of imprinting by hypermethylation of the imprint
control region (ICR) of the maternal allele. What this means is that this allele will act
like the paternal allele and there will be an Igf2 overexpression, the particular cell with this disorder will have a double dose of Igf2 than a normal cell. </p><p>It is known
that Igf2 is a growth promoter so when overexpressed it might lead to cancer,
Wilm’s tumour in this case.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA
demethylating agent, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi). </p><p>It is a
nucleoside analog that works by introducing itself into the DNA. During cell division DNMTs
come to pass methylation marks to the daughter strand and are then irreversibly
binded to this drug. This means that the heritability of methyl marks in the DNA is being
affected in a way that inhibits the pass of this epigenetic mark to the
daughter cell. Now this cell lacks this important epigenetic mark which leads to a high level of genomic inestability and means that it will have more possibility to die. </p><p>As it is dependent on
cell division, cancer cells that have a higher rate of division are more affected
by this drug than normal cells. It is also known that decitabine has an
antitumour effect at low doses and it works better against cancer when combined
with classical chemotherapy.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>It is known that
epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter cells unless
they are removed actively because they are mitotically heritable. This is thanks to specific epigenetic machinery like
DNMT1 which sets DNA methylation in the daughter strand taking as a model the mother strand.</p>

<p>There are sensitive
periods during which there is an intense resetting or change of epigenetic marks
and any action will effect much more the epigenome that if it were done in a
different time. Those are periods of epigenetic reprogramming like early development,
primordial germ cell development and in cell differentiation.</p>

<p>During this
sensitive periods the epigenome of the patient can be changed in some way that
can lead to a disease whereas the same treatment might be harmless o have less
severe secondary effects in a patient not undergoing any of this periods.</p></div>
