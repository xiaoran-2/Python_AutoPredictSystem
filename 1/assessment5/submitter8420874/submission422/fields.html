    <h1>Submission 422 from Anon (session_user_id: 023cf048c3004894df984cee342df67b7c305ec3)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">If a drug alters a cell's DNA methylation state and the cell has intact DNA methyltransferase functionality, the DNA methylation is then mitotically heritable. That is, the daughter cells will maintain the DNA methylation state. If that drug is administered during embryological development or germ cell development (known as the "sensitive periods" because of their acute dependence on changing DNA methylation patterns and timing), it can prevent or interfere with correct DNA methylation causing either abnormal (or even fatal) fetal development or creating germ cells that have incorrect methylation patterns, which may cause either infertility or offspring with some sort of defect.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>If you look at the differences between DNA in normal cells and cancerous cells, you will typically find that normal cells have hypomethylation of CpG islands and hypermethylation of intergenic regions, introns and repetitive elements. In cancerous cells, this tendency is reversed. The CpG islands are hypermethylated, while the intergenic regions, introns and repetitive elements are hypomethylated. Since CpG islands tend to be in promoters of tumour suppressor genes, their methylation blocks the expression of the suppressors, potentially allowing the growth promoting genes to be over active.  </p><p>Hypermethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements leads to genomic stability. In cancer cells, this is reversed, leading to genomic instability because hypomethylation prevents dense chromatin packaging.This can then allow chromosomal abnormalities, such as deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations. These are caused by illegitimate recombination between repeats.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">If an ICR is related to tissue growth and it loses one set of it's parent-of-origin marks, it can become cancerous if either the growth restricting genes are silenced or the growth promoting genes are over expressed. This can happen by either hypo or hyper methylation, depending on the ICR type. Using the H19/Igf2 cluster as an example, Igf2 is a growth factor and H19 is a growth inhibitor. The maternal allele ICR is unmethylated, allowing CTCF to bind to, blocking the downstream enhancers from reaching and expressing Igf2, and instead allows them to express H19. On the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated, preventing CTCF from binding to the ICR, thus allowing the enhancers to express Igf2. if the maternal allele has it's ICR hypermethylated (essentially creating a second copy of the paternal allele), it over expresses Igf2, triggering abnormal growth. This can cause Wilm's tumour, a childhood kidney cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine, a DNA methyaltransferase inhibitor, is used to act on cells of acute myeloid leukemia to prevent silencing of tumor-suppressor genes by preventing excessive methylation of those genes. This happens because the drug contains nucleoside analogues, which become incorporated into the DNA of replicating cells. Then, when a DNA methyltransferase tries to methyalate the site containing these analogues, it is bound irreversibly and that molecule is no longer available to methylate any other DNA. This causes the cells to slow or stop replicating, effectively preventing the cells from creating an advanced cancerous state.</div>
