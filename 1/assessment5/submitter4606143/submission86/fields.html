    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Usually DNA  intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated in normal cells and  CpG islands are not methylated or  hypomethylated.<span><br />DNA methylation at CpG islands increases in cancer and they cannot suppress grow control genes. <br /></span> Genome wide h<span>ypomethylation makes DNA structure less stable. It can course mutations during mitosis.<br />This is a problem in choice of cancer treatment. decreasing methylation can activate tumor suppressing genes and at the same time push up chromosomal instability.    </span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normally CTCF is methylated in paternal allele and lgf2 is expressed. In maternal CTCF is not methylated and Hl9 is expressed but gf2 is not expressed. If CTCF is methylated in both alleles as in case of Wilm's tumor, the two grows promoting genes lgf2 are expressed, i.e. lgf2 is over-expressed.    </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA enzyme methyltransferase.<br />The only information in the Economist article is that decitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.<br /><span>Reduced methylation makes cells more responsiven to the routine chemotherapeutic drugs.</span><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><br />There are evidences that epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation can  be inherited.<br />The term "epigenetic inheritance" is used to describe both cell–cell  and organism–organism or transgenerational information transfer. <br />The examples of the latter are shown in the Overkalix studies and the studies of Dutch famine of 1944. They show that sensitive periods exist, i.e. periods when environmental factors influence to epigenetic is significant. Different studies indicate to gestation period, infantry, slow growth period ( between the ages of 9-12 for boys and 8–10 years for girls) and puberty.<br />It means that cancer treatment in those periods with epigenetic drugs can have remote side effects, The impact  on the next generations should be <span>taken in consideration.<br /> <br /></span><br /><br /></div>
