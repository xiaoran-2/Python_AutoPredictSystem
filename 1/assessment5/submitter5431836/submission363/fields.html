    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>CpG’s islands have unmethylated DNA, which regulates cell
division and allows genes to be expressed. 
Near the start site of gene transcription, CPG islands are usually
located and can help gene prediction.  When
CpG islands are disrupted by cancer, the hyper methylation allows transposable
elements to be promoted and leads to a loss of function of the islands due to
instability in the genome.  Histone
modifications (such as methylation), mutations, carcinogens and microRNA’s can all cause DNA
methylation of CpG islands.  The usually
unmethylated CpG islands become hyper methylated and cause tumor repressor
genes to be silenced, allowing cells to reproduce without control.  The function of DNA methylation in intergenic
regions and repetitive elements helps to keep regions of DNA that are non-functioning
and repetitive from being expressed to keep the genome stable and prevent
transposition of the repetitive and non-functioning areas of genetic code.   When
these areas become hypo methylated, the “junk DNA” is allowed to reproduce and
gain function as reproducing cells such as cancer.  When DNA methylation in intergenic regions
and repetitive elements is disrupted by cancer, the “junk DNA” is allowed to be
coded and promoted, decreasing the stability of the genome and possibly
contributing to the cycle of cancer cell formation. </span></p><p><span> In short, hyper methylation of CpG islands
and hypo methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements leads of loss
of function in healthy areas of the genome and promotion of unhealthy areas of
the genome while the opposite condition leads to opposite results.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19 is tied to Igf2; when H19 becomes methylated, has its
imprinting disrupted and loses function, Igf2 increases its function promoting
cell growth.</p>

<p><span>H19 in the paternal is methylated and silent, causing the
expression of the Igf2 gene to enhance fetal growth.  On the maternal allele, H19 is unmethylated,
reducing the expression of the Igf2 to regulate or stop fetal growth.  </span></p>

<p><span>Cells affected by Wilm’s tumor suffer hyper methylation and a
loss of imprinting of H19, disrupting its growth suppressing abilities, and a
promotion of the Igf2 with its growth promoting properties.  This allows the tumor genes to proliferate.</span></p>

<p><span>H19 has the function of limiting cell proliferation and disruption
of imprinting results in silencing, loss of function instability of the genome and
promotion of growth from oncogene Igf2, which allows cells to divide rapidly as
is needed for cancer to form and thrive.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is an epigenetic drug that is a DNA-demethylating
agent, a chemical that demethylates genes. 
It demthylates genes that have become methylated and stops growth
proliferation.  The stoping of runaway cell
growth stops tumor growth, giving it an antitumor effect.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p></p><span></span><p>Altering DNA methylation in a cell results in the changes to
the genome being passed on to daughter cells, granddaughter cells and so on
down the line.  Each generation coming
from the treated cell has the healthy and correct genome.  

</p><p><span>A sensitive period is time during development in which
epigenetic makeup is vulnerable to environmental signals.  <b>Times
before epigenetic marks are set are sensitive periods of development.  One sensitive period begins with primordial
germ cell development and continues through the maturation of eggs and sperm.  Another sensitive period is the time before and
early on after egg implantation.</b>  <b>As epigenetic marks are not set, treating
patients epigenetically during sensitive periods would disrupt development or
be reset as epigenetic marks become set. 
It is also possible that treatment would not have been needed, we wouldn’t
know as the marks are not set.</b></span></p><p><span>
