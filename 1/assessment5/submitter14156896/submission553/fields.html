    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p> CpG sites are regions of DNA where a cytosine nucleotide occurs
next to a guanine molecule separated by only one phosphate. Therefore, CpG
islands are regions where there are a high number of CpG sites and although the
number of sites required for an island is subjective, it is widely accepted
that there must be a GC percentage of at least 55%. What you would traditionally
find in a ‘normal’ cell’ is that CpG islands are hypomethylated, and the
intergeneic regions (the stretch of DNA sequences located between genes), repetitive
elements and introns are hypermethylated. Hypermethylation is the increase in
the methylation of cytosine and adenosine resides in DNA. Conversely, in a
cancer cell the CpG islands are more likely to be hypermethylated, and the other
regions are hypomethylated. At CpG islands this can cause problems as tumour
suppressor genes may become silenced and this could allow rapid uncontrolled
cell division and the formation of a tumour. In the other regions, the
hypomethylation confers less genomic stability and copy errors such as
insertions, deletions and translactions may occur.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting is an epigenetic process involving DNA
methylation and histone methylation without altering the genetic sequence.
Epigenetic marks are established (imprinted) in the gametes of parents, and are
maintained via mitosis in the somatic cells of the offspring.<br />
For a cell, in the H19/Igf2 cluster, we normally see methylation of the
paternal allele at the ICR but no methylation for the maternal allele. CTCF is a
protein which insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. DNA methylation at the ICR
(which is seen in the paternal allele) blocks binding of the CTCF complex and
without it the H19 gene is silenced as the enhancers can access Igf2 and drive
its expression. In the maternal allele, the complex can bind and the downstream
enhancers act on H19 as a result. This means that in a ‘normal’ cell there is
paternal expression of Igf2 and maternal expression of H19. However, when this
ICR becomes hypermethylated for some reason, both strands appear to be of
paternal origin and you get double/overexpression of Igf2 which is a growth
promoting gene and this can contribute to cancer. Doubled Igf2 expression coupled
with no H19 expression is associated with Wilm’s tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is analong of cytidine (cytosine + pentose sugar)
and is a hypomethylating agent. It belongs to a class of DNA methyltransferase
inhibitors and as such hypomethylates DNA. It is used for the treatment of
myelodysplastic syndromes, which are conditions where certain blood cells are
dysfunctional due to their improper synthesis in the bone marrow. Decitabine
can have an anti-tumour effect because the hypomethylation it causes may in
some way reactivate the epigenetically silenced tumour suppression genes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>As mentioned earlier, DNA and histone methylation contribute
to epigenetic marks that are established in the gametes. Therefore any altering
of DNA methylation can have enduring effects because the changes will be
maintained via mitosis in the somatic cells of the daughter cells. This is very
attractive because treatment at one time can be retained throughout life. However,
these changes may affect the normal functioning of the system, for example when
it is going through a sensitive period. A sensitive period is one where
extensive epigenetic reprogramming occurs and in tandem where epigenetic marks
are reset. Two sensitive periods that have been identified are early child development
before the placenta is created, and primordial germ cell development. It would
be unwise to start treatment in these sensitive periods as a lot of crucial epigenetic
reprogramming, resetting of epigenetic marks/signatures and removal of somatic
marks (in gametes) are occurring which are crucial for development and
survival.</p></div>
