    <div class="field-value">Methylation of promoter-associated CpG islands functions to suppress expression of the corresponding gene.  In cancer, differential hypermethylation is often observed in CpG islands, and in surrounding regions ("CpG island shores") associated with tumor-suppressor genes.  This can act in concert with further insults to enable hyperplasia and tumorigenesis.<br /><br />In contrast, CpGs in intergenic regions and repeats are often methylated in normal cells.  The purpose of this is likely to be suppression of unwanted transcription and RNA splicing.  These sites tend to be broadly hypomethylated in cancer, which leads to genomic instability through recombination, lncRNA-mediated disregulation, aberrant chromatin remodelling, and other mechanisms.  This instability may in turn be oncogenic through a variety of mechanisms (if you prefer, genomic instability is intrinsically probabilistically oncogenic).<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normally, the paternal Igf2/H19 cluster is methylated both at the imprint control region (ICR), which functions as a binding site for the repressor CTCF, and at the promotor for H19.  The effect of this is to inhibit H19 transcription, as well as CTCF binding, which enables downstream enhancers to upregulate Igf2 by inhibiting their interaction with H19, with which Igf2 is in competition.  In the maternal allele, both sites are unmethylated, resulting in increased H19, and decreased Igf2, expression.<br /><br />In Wilms' tumor, both alleles are methylated at these sites, an epigenotype similar to Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (in fact, Wilms' tumor is common in juvenile Beckwith-Wiedemann patients).  This results in overexpression of Igf2, and underexpression of H19.  As the former is a growth factor and the latter a growth-regulating lncRNA, this can result in hyperplasia.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Clinically, Decitabine is an antineoplastic cytotoxin; biochemically, it's a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi): it binds the DNMT/DNA complex, interrupting methylation during cell division.  It thus demethylates passively, diluting methylation marks over cellular generations.  Its therapeutic basis is probably thus in part the demethylation and subsequent reactivation of tumor-suppressing genes, though a variety of other mechanisms, including transcription inhibition and apoptosis induction have been posited.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Considering an abstract purely DNMTi drug, its effects could be expected to be durable largely because methylation is ordinarily only <i>preserved</i>, not established.  Specifically, the hypothetical CGI demethylation of tumor-suppressors should be expected to persist through subsequent cellular generations once effected, as unaffected DNMTs will only <em>re</em>methylate regions already methylated.<br /><br />This has profound consequences for therapy of patients in so-called "sensitive periods": intervals in which cells are being epigenetically reprogrammed, and thus would be effectively permanently demethylated by DNMTis.  The two prototypical epigenetically sensitive periods are systemic reprogramming in the periimplantational period of embryogenesis, and in primordial germ cell reprogramming around the time of sex determination.  However, histospecific programming can occur much later, for example in germ cell maturation in prepubescent (9-12 years) boys.  DNMTs are also active in maturing oocytes.  So DNMTi therapy would seem to be contraindicated for women who are pregnant or may conceive while under therapy, and probably also for many prepubertal children, as it might result in widespread epigenetic alteration in either the patient or progeny.  In severe cases, this might be expected to manifest similarly to an imprinting disorder.<br /></div>
