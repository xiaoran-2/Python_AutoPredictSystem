    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is altered in cancer by hypermethylation or hypomethylation. Methylation of CpG sites within the promoters can lead to silencing of genes such as tumor suppressor genes ( Bird, 2002). Whereas an often ignored complication of cancer is the hypomethylation of CpG islands has been associated with the over expression of oncogenes ( Roman-Gomez et al., 2005). Asides from that  DNA methylation occurs normally in intergenic regions and repetitive element. Although the function of this unclear, it is thought to prevents unnecessary transcription from occurring in a place that is not needed. But disruption of this mechanism leads to genomic instability ( Flanagan &amp; Wild, 2007). As a result of this causes occurrence of illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of cryptic promoters, and disruption of genes leading to abnormal growth of cells ( Wade, 2001).<br /><br /><strong>Reference:</strong><br /><br />Bird A (2002).

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Disruption of imprinting is a factor contributing to cancer which is seen in the H19 gene. The H19 genes is only expressed on one parental allele due to imprinting, where it is maternally inherited, and the paternal is not expressed. Furthermore, only expression of the paternal Igf2 is present normally ( Zemel, Bartolomei &amp; Tilghman,1992). If imprinting is disrupted, the paternal pattern of H19 gene promoter is active, leading to high levels of activation of H19 and Igf2, causing an increase in cell growth (Webber, Ingram, Levorse &amp; Tilghman, 1998) . This mechanism is  seen in cancers as Wilm's tumor where it is caused by the loss of imprinting; leading of paternal methylation of H19 gene and activation of the maternal Igf2 gene leading to abnormal growth (Steenman et al., 1994).<br /><br /><strong>Reference:</strong><br /><span><span></span> </span><br />Steenman, M. <i>et al.</i> (1994). Loss of imprinting of IGF2 is linked to reduced expression and abnormal methylation of H19 in Wilms'tumor.  <i>Nature Genetics</i> 7, 437.<br /><br />Webber, A., Ingram, R.I., Levorse, J., and Tilghman, S.M. (1998). 
Location of enhancers is essential for imprinting of H19 and Igf2.

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;

    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is drug for treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes with similar properties as azacitidine. It belongs to a class of epigenetic inhibitors called DNA-demethylating agents that hypomethylate DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase which prevents DNA synthesis. As DNA synthesis comes to a hail, it will eventually lead to the cytotoxicity of cancer cells( Kantarjian, Issa &amp; Rosenfeld, 2006).<br /><br /><strong>Reference:</strong><br /><span><br />Kantarjian

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is the basis for imprinting X chromosome inactivation and formation of heterochromatin (Berdasco &amp; Esteller, 2010). As methylation of promoter regions are inversely correlated to gene expression and the effects of drugs will continue long after use due to alterations which produce repeatable, predictable changes in gene expression ( Maze &amp; Nestler, 2011). Sensitive period is the stage of the cell that is vulnerable to environmental factors to alter epigenetic mechanisms common in early development and differentiation of a cell (Costa et al., 2009). It is not advisable to treat during sensitive periods as it alters the epigenetic complexes and leads to global and gene specific changes (Zink, Fischer &amp; Nickerson, 2004).<br /><br /><strong>Reference:</strong><br /><br />Berdasco M,  Esteller M.
