    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>1. CpG islands (CGIs)</div><div><b>In normal cells</b>, usually we don’t see methylation at CGIs. But if we do find methylation at CGIs, it is associated with gene silencing.</div><div><b>In cancer cells</b>, CGIs are more likely to be methylated. CGI hypermethylation results in silencing tumour suppressor genes.<br /><br /></div><div>2. Repetitive elements and intergenic regions<br /></div><div><b>In normal cells</b>, repetitive elements and intergenic regions are methylated. Here the function of DNA methylation is to maintain genomic stability.</div><div><b>In cancer cells</b>, repetitive elements and intergenic regions are hypomethylated. The consequence of hypomethylation is genomic instability.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div><strong>In normal cells:</strong></div><div>The imprint control region (ICR) is unmethylated on the <em>maternal</em> allele. The ICR is bound by a protein called CTCF. CTCF is an insulator protein, it insulates Igf2 from the downstream enhancers. In this case, the enhancers will act on H19, but Igf2 will be silent. So, we don’t see Igf2 expression from the maternal allele.</div><div>The ICR is methylated on the <em>paternal</em> allele. CTCF can no longer bind. Without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence and the enhancers can access Igf2. So, Igf2 is expressed from the paternal allele.</div><div><strong>In Wilm’s tumour:</strong></div><div>Methylation of the ICR happens on both alleles. As a result, we have expression of Igf2 from the maternal allele as well. Since Igf2 promotes growth, its overexpression leads to tumour.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) belongs to DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors. It gets incorporated into the DNA instead of 2'-deoxycytidine upon replication (S-phase of the cell cycle) and then binds DNMT <em>irreversibly</em>. The decrease in amount of intracellular DNMT results in DNA demethylation. In particular, demethylation of CGIs in tumour suppressor genes leads to reactivation of these genes and, hence, prevention of growth.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. That’s why altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome.</div><div>With respect to epigenetics, sensitive periods are periods of epigenetic reprogramming, namely early embryonic development and primordial germ cell development. Since epigenetic marks are established during sensitive periods, treating patients at these stages would be inadvisable.</div></div>
