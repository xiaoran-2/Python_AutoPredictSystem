    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, CpG islands are usually hypomethylated
while intergenic regions, introns and repetitive elements are usually hypermethylated.
DNA Methylation at CpG islands in the promoters regions leads to silencing of
gene expression by the formation of a repressive chromatin structure and by
prohibiting transcription factor binding.</p>

<p>In cancer cells, the DNA methylation profile is swept
off. Thus, we can observe a locus specific DNA hypermethylation (<span>CpG islands and CpG island
shores of tumour suppressor genes) and genome-wide DNA-hypomethylation (R<a></a>epetitive regions, i</span>ntrons and ICRs
– loss of imprinting).</p>

<p>In cancer, DNA methylation is an alternative to genetic mutation.
Thus, DNA hypomethylation can activate oncogenes and initiate chromosome
instability, whereas DNA hypermethylation initiates silencing of tumor
suppressor genes. Accordingly, the silencing of tumour suppressor
genes is recognised as one hit in the Knudson hypothesis. With other hits, the
silencing of tumour suppressor genes will confer cells growth advantages
(proliferation, cell-migration, outcompeting with other cells or evading
cell-death).</p>

<p>The functions
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements
are to maintain the genomic integrity by 1) silencing of repeats to
prevent transposition, 2) mutation of the repeats (meC to T) to prevent
transposition, 3) silencing of repeats to avoid transcriptional
interference from strong promoters, and 4) methylation of repeats may prevent
illegitimate recombination.</p>

<p>In cancer,
one of the earliest epigenetic aberrations found was a genome-wide
hypomethylation at intergenic regions/ repeats. These aberrations allow genomic
instability such as 1) illegitimate recombination
between repeats, 2) activation of repeats and
transposition, and 3) activation of cryptic promoters
and disruption to neighbouring genes (c.f. Avy and Axinfu alleles).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, the imprinted control region (ICR),
around the H19/Igf2 locus, is usually unmethylated on the maternal allele,
which allows the binding of a protein called CTCF (an insulator protein). Thus,
CTCF's binding insulate Igf2 from the downstream enhances and represses the
expression of Igf2 from the maternal allele. In addition, the enhancers are now
free to act on H19 and enhance H19 expression on the maternal allele. </p>

<p><i>In contrast, t</i><i>he imprinted control region of the paternal
allele is methylated. Methylation of ICR of the paternal chromosome prevents
the CTCF binding. Therefore, if CTCF cannot bind and there is no insulator
action, then the enhancers are free to act on Igf2 and promote Igf2's
expression from the paternal allele.</i></p>

<p><i>In Wilm’s
tumor, imprinting at the H19/Igf2 is lost. Both alleles are methylated (they
behave as the parental allele). The CTCF cannot bind any more to the H19/Igf2
cluster. These epigenetic alterations induce the expression of Igf2 from the
two alleles and promote cell proliferation that leads to cancer development.
Finally, the expression level of H19 is usually shutdown in Wilm’s tumor.</i></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><i>Decitabine is an anti-cancer or “antineoplastic”
chemotherapy drug. Decitabine is a member of drug family known as DNA
"demethylating" agents or </i><i><i>(</i>DNA methyltransferase inhibitors).</i></p>

<p><i>By switching off a protein called DNA methyltransferase
(DNMT), Decitabine reduces the global levels of 5-methylcytosine (5mC).Thus,
Decitabine</i><i> functions as DNA methyltransferase
inhibitor and has shown substantial potency in reactivating epigenetically silenced
tumor suppressor genes that reduces cells growth and might make the cells more
sensitive to other anti-cancer drugs.</i><i></i></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><i>Currently, DNA methylation is one
of the most broadly studied and well-characterized epigenetic modifications. We
know that both environment and individual lifestyle can directly interact with
the genome to influence epigenetic changes. Thus, manipulating DNA methylation
is a very attractive concept to treat some kind of human cancer. Indeed, once
the treatments that can modify the DNA methylation status have been achieved, the
resulting epigenetic modifications will be permanent because the DNA methylation
marks are mitotically heritable.</i></p>

<p><i>However, these global treatments
may interfere with other targets within the cell, especially during critical
periods of time where extensive epigenetic reprogramming occurs (i.e. in pregnant
mothers and a few months before conception). Accordingly, it would not be advisable
to prescribe </i><i>DNA
demethylating agents </i><i>to pregnant mothers or to women just
before conception. These treatments might have several adverse effects because numerous
epigenetic reprogramming happen during these active and sensitive periods of development
(i.e. formation of male and female gametes).</i><i></i></p></div>
