    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a cytidine analog which belongs to the class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. When it is incorporated in the DNA, the DNA is prevented from getting methylated leading to a hypomethylated state of the DNA. Since DNA methylation is usually unregulated on tumor suppressor (TS) genes in cancer causing silencing of these genes and thereby promoting tumor growth, the hypomethylating effect of decitabine is believed to restore the tumor suppressing function of the TS genes. Decitabine shows an anti-tumor effect in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). As cancer cells are faster dividing than normal cells, decitabine is more intensely integrated into the metabolism of cancer cells which is thought to have a direct toxic effect on the tumor cells. Also, epigenetic inhibitors generally have a greater impact on cancer cells as their dependency on epigenetic alterations make them more sensitive to epigenetic drugs. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at CpG islands is found on 70-80% of CpG nucleotides in normal somatic cells of mammals. It plays an important role in development as DNA methylation is associated with gene silencing and determines the fate of a cell, e.g. weather a cell becomes a liver cell or a neuron. Also, DNA methylation plays an important role in X chromosome inactivation, as in early female development one X chromosome needs to be inactivated which then forms the so-called barr body, as well as in imprinting which happens during primordial germ cell development. In cancer CpG islands are found to be hypermethylated causing silencing of tumor suppressor (TS) genes. As tumor suppressors play an essential role in cell cycle control, DNA repair and apoptosis (controlled cell death), inhibition of TS genes mediates a pro-tumorigenic effect. This epigenetic silencing event can also constitute one hit as described in Knudson's two hit theory, hence contributing to cancer development. <br />Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are found to be methylated to a high extend in normal cells which serves, for instance, the silencing of transposable elements in the DNA which constitute a high percentage of DNA and have the potential to disrupt gene function when being integrated into intragenic regions. Also, CpG poor promoters are usually methylated in normal cells because they are very strong if hypomethylated. DNA of cancer cells shows genome-wide hypomethylation, especially in repeat and CpG poor promoter regions which leads to a general genomic instability. This genomic instability can cause the activation of unwanted gene expression as, for example, cryptic promoter activation as well as interrepeat recombination and transposon activation. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>

						<p>On the paternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster the imprinting control region (ICR) and the H19 locus are DNA methylated. The protein CTCF can thus not bind to the ICR and H19 is not produced, which allows downstream enhancers to activate expression of the upstream located insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2) gene. The ICR of the H19/Igf2 cluster on the maternal allele, on the other hand, is not methylated, which allows binding of CTCF to the ICR that consequently functions as an insulator, preventing the downstream enhancers from interacting with the Igf2 promoter and H19 is expressed.</p><p>In Wilm's tumor, the ICR of the maternal allele is also methylated, yielding to Igf2 being expressed form both alleles and H19 expression being decreased on both alleles. As Igf2 is a growth factor which promotes cell growth, the neoplastic transformation is promoted by the epigenetic activation Igf2. Moreover, the H19 gene which expresses non-coding RNAs, was proposed to have a tumor repressor function. Hence, it's decreased expression in Wilm's tumor promotes cancer growth as well. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>

						<p>Altering DNA methylation can have an enduring effect on the epigenome since epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable, meaning that they passed on during cell division to their daughter cells. The methyltransferase DNMT1 is responsible to maintain DNA methylation during cell divisions. A sensitive period is a period during which cells show increased sensitivity to epigenetic reprogramming. Normal somatic cells are usually not as sensitive to epigenetic drugs as cancer cells, since the latter are dependent on epigenetic alterations to evolve. However, treatment during sensitive periods would increase the drug potential in the sensitive non-cancer cells and thereby increase the risk of side effects in these cells. Sensitive periods during development are early embryonic development ant primordial germ cell (PGC) development. Hence, in order to protect the embryo during development it would be inadvisable to treat pregnant woman with epigenetic drugs. </p>
