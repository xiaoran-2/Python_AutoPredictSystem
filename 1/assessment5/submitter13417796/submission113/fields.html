    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value">Normally in CpG
island, the  island are tend to be remain open to

express to gene activity, that mean it stay open for methylation. In 
cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then
causes silencing of the underlying gene.CpG
island hypermethylation and associated gene silencing occurs really frequently
in tumours. Another way, a
tumour suppressor gene can be hypermethylated which restrict its activity. Repetitive
elements and intergenic regions tend to be stay methylated to restrict the over activity of any gene. It also maintain
genomic integrity or to maintain genomic stability. So
in cancer we see regions that are hyermethylated in the CPG islands, but genome
wide particularly the repeats in the intergenic regions are hypomethylated which do the opposite activity in case of normal state which cause aberrant cell growth. this loss of genomic integrity cause aberrant cell growth which ultimately cause cancer. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span> A long  noncoding RNA called H19, produced just from the  maternal allele. the imprint control region is bound by protein 
CTCF, and  CTCF is an insulator protein. CTCF's binding insulate
Igf2  from the downstream enhancer. These  enhancers are now free to act on H19 and  enhance H19 expression on the maternal  allele which is unmethylated. the paternal allele when  imprint  control region is methlyated CTCF can  no longer bind so
no  insulator action. these enhancers
are free to act on Igf2  and promote Igf2's expression from the  paternal allele. So Igf2 is expressed only  from the paternal allele and not the  maternal allele.</span><span>Up
regulation of IGF2 is  overall growth
promoting which results from loss of imprinting.  Wilms tumour are
caused by  loss of imprinting and  over-expression of growth promoting genes as Igf2 is overall growth promoting.</span><span> In case of cancer, with loss of imprinting and hypermethylation  of the imprint control region on the  maternal allele have expression of Igf2. there is double dose of Igf2 in  comparison to a normal cell. And Igf2 is
growth promoting so loss of imprinting 
is observed in a very wide array of tumour types and  hypermethylation or  hypomethylation are also found.</span>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine belongs to DNA 
methyltransferase inhibitors which inhibits </span>DNA methyltransferase one(<span>DNMT1)</span>. <span>Decitabine incorporated
into the DNA  upon replication and when the
 DNMT1 comes along to bind that  nucleotide to t copy the methylation  to the daughter strand, that DNA methyltransferase
is bound irreversibly and it can no longer be released. The action of
these  DNA methyltransferase inhibitors
is  division dependent so the cell need
to be replicating.  So this means that
cancer cells which are dividing much more rapidly than most  other cells in the body will be more severely
affected as it will halt the replication as they're  replicating more.</span>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The DNA methaylation is a epigenetics mark which is stable and mitoticlly heritable which mean this mark can be transferred to daughter cell. so any alter can transferred to daughter cell which in long term can cause a gene silencing or gene over expression. 

<p>Sensitive periods when
changes in the environment are going to 
have the biggest effect over the epigenome as epigenetic reprogramming occur on that time. There's
two  reprogramming windows, the
primordial germ cell development, and early embryonic development. are sensitive periods for epigenetic reprogramming. as in time of sensitive period environment has the largest effect and the drugs  that inhibits the epigenetic machinery cause very large insult to  the environment. So treating patients during <br />during sensitive periods is  inadvisable.</p></div>
