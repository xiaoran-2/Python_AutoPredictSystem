    <div class="field-value">The <strong>CpG islands</strong> are often fund at<strong> promoters of genes</strong>, the <strong>methylated CpG islands</strong> can be bound by <strong>CpG binding proteins</strong> which can recruit other factors that <strong>condense</strong> the chromatin, methylated CpG islands also<strong> prohibit</strong> transcription factor binding the chromatin, so the methylation of CpG islands <strong>silences</strong> the expression of the genes e.g. the inactivation of X chromosomes in female, and the methylation is <strong>mitotic heritable</strong>. The CpG islands are <strong>usually unmethylated</strong>, but in cancer cells, CpG islands are usually<strong> hypermethylated</strong>, which leads to the silencing of the underlying genes, especially the <strong>tumour suppressor genes</strong> that regulate the life cycle of cell or responsible for the DNA repair. The silencing of tumour suppressor genes may lead to the cell undergoes uncontrolled cell division as well as the increase in chance of mutation during DNA replication, those would contribute to the evolve of tumour. The methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements <strong>silence</strong> those highly expressed genes, the<strong> transcriptional interference</strong> from <strong>strong promoters</strong> is therefore reduced by methylation of those genes. The intergenic regions and repetitive elements are <strong>usually methylated</strong> in normal cells, the methylation of those regions maintain the <strong>genomic integrity</strong> by preventing the<strong> mutation</strong> due to transposition and illegitimate recombination. However, the wide range<strong> hypomethylation</strong> in intergenic regions and repetitive elements occurs in cancer, it results in the increase of  <strong>genomic instability</strong> as well as the <strong>deregulation</strong> of tissue specific and imprinted genes. Those are related to the increasing rate of genomic mutation and the development of tumour tissue.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In<b> paternal</b> chromosome, the <b>ICR</b> that control the synthesis of protein <b>CTCF</b> is <b>methylated</b>, so the CTCF protein is<b> not</b> expresses and lead to the <b>methylation</b> of the CpG islands of<b> H19</b>, which <b>silence</b> the expression of H19. The enhancers are therefore<b> enhance</b> the expression of <b>Igf2</b> on the <b>paternal</b> chromosome. In <b>maternal</b> chromosome, the CTCF protein is expressed due to the<b> unmethylation</b> of the ICR, CTCF<b> prevents</b> the promoter of H19 from being<b> methylated</b>,  as a result, the enhancers underlying <b>enhance</b> the expression of<b> H19</b>. In<strong> Wilm's tumour</strong>, the ICR that express CTCF is <strong>hypermethylated</strong>, this caused the <strong>absence</strong> of CTCF, the H19 is consequently methylated, and the enhancers on the<strong> maternal</strong> chromosome enhance the <strong>Igf2</strong> instead of <strong>H19</strong>. The <strong> overexpression </strong>of Igf2 hence occurs, because the H19 is a <strong>growth restricting gene</strong> and Igf2 is a <strong>growth promoting gene</strong>, those result in the development of tumour then subsequently cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a <strong>DNMT inhibitor</strong>, it causes <strong>DNA demethylation</strong> in the <strong>daughter cells</strong> of the cancer cells .Because in cancer cells, the <strong>tumour suppressor genes</strong> are <strong>hypermethylated</strong>, Decitabine binds to DNMTs<strong> irreversibly</strong>, the fuction of DNMT is <strong>maintaining</strong> the DNA methylation in the daughter cells, so DNMT is <strong>unable</strong> to methylate the daughter cells produced after binding Decitabine, the hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes in the daughter cells of the cancer cells is not maintained, the tumour is therefore suppressed.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">If the <strong>DNA methylation</strong> is altered in a cell, it can be <strong>mitotically inherited</strong> to the daughter cells, this process is regulated by the <strong>enzymes</strong> e.g.<strong> DNMT</strong>, and have a enduring effect due to its<strong> inheritability</strong>. But in <strong>sensitive period</strong>, the epigenetic imprints(e.g.<strong> DNA methylation</strong>) on the germ cells are not established and can be easily influenced by the <strong>environment</strong>(e.g. drug, diet). Female in <strong>pregnancy</strong> and people <strong>before puberty</strong> are in sensitive period, people during those period are not advised to take drug that <strong>altering DNA methylation</strong> is because the drugs are <strong>not</strong> tumour tissue <strong>specific</strong>, and may affect  the DNA methylation on the other normal tissue. The <strong>side effect</strong> on those people in sensitive period may be serious, as their epigenetic states in normal cells are also experiencing  a great alteration, the long term effect of the drugs on them is therefore unclear.</div>
