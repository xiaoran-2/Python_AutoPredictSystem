    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are common at the promoter sites of genes and bind proteins which promote the transcription of that gene. DNA methylation inhibits the binding of these promoter-specific proteins from binding, thus inhibiting transcription. In normal cells, the genes that the cell does not need to function are methylated at their CpG islands and thus, turned off. In cancer, many of the genes that the cell requires for normal function, such as the tumor-suppressor genes, which regulate cell growth and promote apoptosis if the cell is damaged, are hyper-methylated and turned off, leading to uncontrolled cell division and resistance to cell death that are characteristic of tumors. In normal cells, the intergenic CpG islands as well as those of the repetitive elements are methylated. Methylation of the intergenic CpG islands inhibits spontaneous transcription of the DNA in that region that might disrupt the transcription of a nearby essential gene. Methylation of the CpG islands of repetitive elements, which are very strong promoters, prevents the activation of any nearby genes which would not normally be expressed at that time in the normal cell. This methylation also prevents opening up of the normal heterochromatin to euchromatin which can find another repeat element in another region of the genome to recombine with and lead to translocation.  It also prevents the activity if the repetitive element  which may be mobile and cut itself out, leaving a double-stranded break in the DNA. Thus, it promotes stability of the genome. In cancer, these regions are hypo-methylated which leads to genomic instability such as chromosome rearrangements and breaking of chromosomes seen in cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprinted genes are many times genes that control cell growth and are important in development. Improper imprinting can lead to overexpression of these genes and can promote cancer. In the normal paternal allele, the ICR is methylated and prevents binding of the insulator CTCF, which would prevent enhancement of the nearby Igf2 gene, (an insulin-like growth factor gene) thereby allowing its expression. Additionally, the DNA methylation at the ICR spreads downstream to the promoter of H19, a lncRNA gene, preventing its expression. The enhancers downstream are then free to enhance expression of Igf2 and cannot enhance H19 because it has been silenced. In the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated, blocking the enhancers from activating Igf2. The promoters are of H19 are not methylated, and the enhancers activate its transcription instead of Igf2. In Wilm's tumor, the maternal pattern of imprinting is lost, both in the H19/Igf2 cluster and the upstream Kcnq1 cluster, which causes loss of expression of the tumor suppressor Cdkn1c, leading to twice the expression of the growth factor Igf2 and no production of the tumor suppressor Cdkn1c, which promotes tumor formation.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNMT (DNA methyl transferase) inhibitor. When a cell is treated with Decitabine, it results in the hypomethylation of all the CpG islands within that cell. When tumor cells are treated, it can prevent the hypermethylation of the CpG islands at the promoters of the tumor suppressor genes, thus restoring their activity in the tumor cell. This could result in the tumor cell slowing its rate of growth and cell division and make it more susceptible to induction to of apoptosis.    </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The pattern of DNA methylation is mitotically inheritable through the action of DNMT1, which recognizes the hemi-methylated state of the newly replicated DNA of the daughter cell and methylates the complimentary strand at the CpG islands, restoring the fully methylated parental cell state. Sensitive periods refer to those times when the cell is undergoing active epigenomic remodelling. During these sensitive periods, the pattern of epigenetic markers laid down (histone markers and DNA methylation) are susceptible to environmental influences. Sensitive periods in embryonic development are: 1)In mammals, between fertilization and formation of the blastocyst, in which epigenetic marks of the parental genome (except for imprinted genes) are erased and new  embryonic somatic markers are laid down, and 2)In mid-gestation, in the primordial germ cells, the somatic markers are removed and replaced by germ cell-specific markers. Treatment of pregnant women would be inadvisable because of the effect on the developing fetus. In early gestation, the fetus would probably not develop under treatment, in mid-gestation, the germ cells of the fetus would be impacted, and in all stages of pregnancy, cell differentiation in the fetus would be impacted.</div>
