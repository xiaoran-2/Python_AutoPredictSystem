    <div class="field-value">In normal DNA, lone CpG sites are methylated, whereas CpG islands lack methylation. However, in cancer, DNA tends to be methylated at CpG islands, silencing tumor suppressor genes. In contrast to CpG islands, in normal DNA, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are silenced via methylation. This prevents repetitive elements from jumping or pasting themselves around the genome. Furthermore, this prevents abnormal recombination where repetitive elements may attempt to trade sequences. In cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated, contributing to genomic instability as abnormal recombination and copying occurs. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because the methylated bases can be inherited via enzymes that pass the methylation marks to the daughter DNA strands. Sensitive periods are periods in which there is an especially large amount of activity in laying down epigenetic marks. Reference to such periods usually conjures the periods of primordial germ cell development and early development of the fertilized egg as totipotency gives way to differentiated cells. However, epigenetic marks are laid down any time stem cells differentiate into mature functional cells (e.g. bone marrow stem cells differentiating to form blood and immune cells). Treating patients with epigenetic-altering drugs during (early) pregnancy would be inadvisable, because these chemicals would presumably affect the new marks which are being laid down in the developing baby. While such drugs may successfully treat the mother, offspring may inherit diseases. The same caution must hold true during other sensitive periods, such as during primordial germ cell development, so that unintended epigenetic modifications do not occur.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprinted genes are generally associated with growth. Cancer, which in a a certain sense is simply abnormal growth, is associated with irregular methylation of imprinted genes. Growth activating genes are switched on in cancer; growth suppressing genes are switched off. In the H19/Igf2 cluster, methylation of an imprint control region (ICR) determines whether IgF2 or H19 is expressed. In healthy cells, the maternal ICR is unmethylated, allowing a protein, CTCF, to bind, which precludes downstream enhancers from acting on IgF2 (which is hypothesized to be the preferred chromatin loop). These enhancers then upregulate H19 (non-coding RNA which serves as a miRNA reservoir) instead. In paternal cells, the ICR is methylated, discouraging binding of CTCF, thereby allowing the preferred enhancer function: upregulation of IgF2. In Wilm's tumor, both alleles are methylated, meaning more of the growth factor IgF2 is produced and less of the stabilizing H19 derived miRNA is produced. The resultant genome destabilization and overexpression of growth factors contribute to cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent. It inhibits DNA methyltransferase, which prevents mitotic heritability of methyl groups; in other words, it's a passive demethylating agent. Such a passive mechanism targets rapidly dividing cells (i.e. tumor cells) while leaving non-dividing cells (i.e. most somatic cells) untouched. Removing DNA methylation from tumor cells causes all manner of problems for the tumor cell because many previously silenced genes become expressed (wasting cellular resources), and furthermore, tumor suppressor genes that may previously have been silenced may now be expressed and act to cause tumor cell death. </div>
