    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is altered in cancer cells in two main ways.  In normal cells the CpG islands and island shores of tumor suppressor genes are hypomethylated, these genes remain active and tumor growth will be suppressed.  In cancer cells, the CpG islands and shores become hypermethylated which leads to inactivation of the tumor suppressor genes and hence tumor growth.  <br /><br />Secondly, the methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements within  the genome are altered in cancer cells.  In normal cells these regions are methylated and inactive.  Conversely, in cancer cells, these same regions lose their methylation (hypomethylation) and this leads to genetic instability.  In normal cells these repetitive elements and intergenic regions are hypermethylated, densely packed, and silenced, but in cancer cells these receptive regions are hypomethylated, have similar areas which align and become open and accessible for transcription.  This leads to illegitimate recombinations and the normally silenced repetitive regions of the genes can become active.  Neighboring genes can also become active.  These aberrations can result in insertions, deletions, and translocations within the chromosomes (genetic instability).</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprinted genes have important roles in growth promotion and growth suppression.  Disruption of imprinting can can contribute to cancer by allowing unrestricted growth.  In normal cells, imprinting marks are as follows, the paternal allele of the H19 gene is methylated at the Imprint control region and Igf2 factor (insulin growth factor) is expressed.  The maternal allele is silenced and no Igf2 is expressed.  These imprinting regions are disrupted in Wilm's tumor, so that the genes in both alleles are expressed and there is a resulting double dose of the growth promotor IgF2; the result is more tumor growth.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is an FDA approved drug used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome which leads to a type of cancer called acute myelogenous leukemia.  This drug belongs to a class of epigenetic DNA methyltransferase inhibitors - small molecules that target the enzymes in the epigenetic machinery.  They demethylate genes by irreversibly binding DNMT; they are nucleotide analogs that are incorporated into  DNMT1 (a DNA methyltransferase enzyme).  The methylation of   cells occurs during cell division so cancerous blood cells which undergo rapid cell division will be especially vulnerable to demethylation by the drug.  At high doses the drug is toxic- targeting all cells nonspecifically, but at lower doses they are tolerated well by patients.  Their exact mechanism is unclear, but they suppress tumor growth by demethylating and reactivating tumor suppressor genes which are dependent on hypermethylation.  When the tumor suppressor genes are reactivated the tumor growth will be suppressed.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that target epigenetic marks of DNA methylation can have lasting effects on the epigenome because they are mitotically heritable; i..e the changes in methylation patterns induced by the drugs will be passed on to all the daughter cells of the tumor and the tumor will continue to be effected.  It is advisable to avoid treating children with these drugs because they would disrupt the epigenetic marks being laid down during sensitive periods of development.  The sensitive periods include early embryonic development and also the period when eggs and sperm are being formed.  If young people were to be treated when the gametes were still being formed this would disrupt the  reprogramming and the epigenetic marks that are being laid down during this period.</div>
