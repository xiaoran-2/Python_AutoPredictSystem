    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;

    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>

    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.

    <div class="field-value">Commonly, cancer cells show loss of expression in imprinted genes. In normal cells imprinted genes are supposed to show mono allelic parent of origin expression, however sometimes methylation pattern changes on maternal/paternal alleles result in imprinted genes being expressed on both parental alleles or silenced on both parental alleles. Many imprinted genes such as igf2 are involved with tumour growth (promotion/suppression) and can <strong>contribute to cancer</strong> when imprinting is disrupted (altered dosages). <br /><br />In normal cells imprinted control regions can be <strong>methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated in the maternal allele</strong>. The unmethylated ICR on the maternal allele is insulated by a CTCF binder, causing enhancers to act upon H19, therefore Igf2 will be silent on the maternal allele. Whilst on the paternal allele the ICR is methylated and enhancers act on igf2 because there is no CTCF insulator, <strong>resulting in Igf2 expression</strong> solely on the paternal allele. <br /><br />Alternatively in <b>Wilms tumour</b>,  Hypermethylation of ICR's on the maternal and paternal allele can lead to igf2 expression on both parental alleles as there are no CTCF insulators, therefore enhancers act upon igf2 on both alleles, resulting in maternal expression along with paternal expression, causing a double dose of igf2, promoting irregular.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In <strong>normal cells, CpG islands are not methylated</strong>, this includes Cpg island shores (2 kb region around island). <br /><br />In cancer cells, locus specific CpG islands associated with tumour suppressor genes are more likely to be methylated. Methylation of CpG islands is associated with gene silencing because of the repressive chromatin structure, therefore tumour suppressor genes are silenced in cancer cells which show excessive gene growth beyond the cell cycle, leading to development of tumours. Silencing of specific CpG islands also causes genomic instability as imprinted and tissue specific genes are deregulated. The type of CpG islands that are methylated vary depending on tumour type. <br /><b><br /></b><b></b>In <strong>normal cells, DNA is methylated at interngenic regions</strong>, repetitive elements and at introns in genes. Methylation at intergenic regions helps maintiain genomic integrity and silence transcription start/splice sites allowing suppression of the region. Repetitive elements are mutagenic and therefore methylation allows the repeats to be silenced (preventing transcription) and avoiding interference with cell purpose. Recombinations are less likely to occur with methylation. <strong> In cancer cells however</strong>, methylation from intergenic regions and repetitive elements is removed as there is a failure to maintain DNMT1, diluting out methyl groups leading to hypomethylation and genomic instability. This means repeats can move around and disrupt/activate other genes, causing genomic instability which is correlated with cancer. <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the class of epigenetic inhibitors labelled <b>DNA methytransferase inhibitors</b> and is sold in the form of azacitidine. <br /><br />Hypermethylation of tumour suppressors is associated with many cancers, which are linked to a mutation in enzyme Ezh2 that increases DNA methylation.  Methylation condenses chromosomal packaging resulting in silencing of tumour suppressor genes and exsessive cell growth. Decitabine has <b>an anti-tumour effect</b> as it <b>removes methylation groups from histone proteins and reduces hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes</b>. This slows down the silencing of important genes vital to genomic stability and cell regulation. By allowing the activation of tumour suppresser genes decitabine combats excessive cell growth. <br /><br />Additionally Decitabine is believed to alter tumours to increase sensitivity to chemotherapy allowing a more successful response to the treatment. Decitabine has also penetrated solid tumours that are harder to treat.  <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Considering epigenetic markers are reversible, DNA methylation can be altered with small molecules in drugs such as DNMTI's. There is not enough known on specific acting drugs that target enzymatic epigenetic elements. Epigenetic drugs can alter the sensitivity of tumour cells allowing them to be more easily altered by standard treatments, however it is difficult to predict what impact of altering DNA methylation will have on the <b>epigenome</b>. Altering DNA methylation affects other surrounding cells/tissues and can have l<b>ong-term implications</b> on normal cells by altering methyl marks which are mitotically heritable.  Enduring effects include change in gene expression and alteration in chromatin structure. Epigenetic drugs given in high doses can prove toxic and give side effects.<br /><br />A sensitive period is a <b>period of epigenetic reprogramming</b> when the epigenetic marks are being cleared or reset. Sensitive periods include <b>pre-implantation</b> development and <b>germ cell development</b>. <b>Treating pregnant women during sensitive periods</b> where epigenetic marks are not fully established or stabile, would not be as affective or safe because they would restrict the epigenetic machinery. This would alter the way the epigenetic markers interact with the DNA and can result in serious side effects and alterations to genetic information. <br /><br /></div>
