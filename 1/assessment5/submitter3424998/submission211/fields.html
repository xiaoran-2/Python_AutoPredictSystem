    <div class="field-value"><span>Comparing normal cells to cancerous ones,
scientists have observed a kind of swapping in their DNA methylation pattern.
There have been two phenomena described: a hypomethylation of the genome, taken
as a whole, together with hypermethylation on typically unmethylated sites,
like CpG islands. Those hypermethylated CpG islands have usually been found in
the promoters of genes that are tumour supressors. DNA methylation is
associated with gene silencing. The tumour supresor genes are involved in
regulation of abnormal cells, like cancer cells and, due to hypermethylation
have adopted a silent state. As DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic mark
that is mitotically heritable, all the daughter cells will inherit the silent
state of the tumour supressor genes of their progenitor cell. They don´t die
and continue dividing instead, gradually taking over normal tissues and leading
to extension of cancer.  </span>

<p><span>Hypomethylation, on the other hand,
has been observed on sites that are normally methylated, like the intergenic
regions and the introns of genes. In cancer they present loss of methylation,
although not entirely unmethylated. The same has been observed with the
repetitive elements – a heavy methylation that prevents them from being
expressed and inserted in different places of the genome where they can disrupt
other genes´ expression, is lost  or
reduced in cancerous cells, allowing for greater genomic instability, one of
the hallmarks of cancer.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprinting is parent-of-origin-specific
monoalellic expression of a gene. Many imprinted genes are associated with
growth – they either promote or supress growth. Cancer cells have been shown to
present loss of imprinting. They have both maternal and paternal
alelles of a particular gene silenced or expressed at the same time. Imprint
control regions (ICRs) in cancer don´t present unidirectional aberrations –
they can show either hyper-, or hypomethylation in comparison to a normal cell.
If we take the H19/Igf2 cluster as an example, its ICR has a methylated
paternal alelle and unmethylated maternal alelle. The unmethylated maternal
alelle is free to allow the CTCF bind to it and act as an insulator for the
Igf2 gene found upstream. The Igf2 gene is silenced from that alelle, while
allowing the enhancers to promote the expression of the H19 gene. On the
paternal alelle, the enhancers, that have a binding preference for the Igf2
gene, are free to bind there and promote the expression of Igf2. In cancer, both
alelles are methylated, leading to a double expression of the Igf2 , that is a
growth promoting gene. Wilm´s tumour is a child kidney tumour associated with
loss of imprinting in the H19/Igf2 cluster.

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a drug that acts as a DNA-demethylating
agent. It inhibits the function of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1). These kind of
drugs are a kind of a laboratory-synthesized nucleoside analogs. They get
inserted into the DNA during the replication process. When DNMT1 comes along to
bind them and methylate the daughter strand, the bond results irreversible and
the methylation does not take place. The cell needs to be dividing (initiated
the process of DNA replication) for the process to take place. Cancer cells are
dividing at a higher rate than normal cells, thus becoming predominantly
affected by the drug. For the positive effects in cancer treatment to take
place, those drugs are being administered at very low doses, otherwise
resulting highly poisonous. The demethylating agents are developed in regards
with the understanding that there are different parts of the genome that are
hypermethylated in cancer, while unmethylated in normal cells.

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is one of the best
understood epigenetic marks. It is set up in early development and then
mitotically heritable for the entire resulting lineage and for the rest of the
life of the organism. If the methylation pattern of a cell can be acted upon
and modified, the daughter cells that result from this modified cell will
inherit its methylation pattern and pass it on to their progeny. There are two
periods in the life of a mammal when the epigenome is erased and reset again,
laying down the epigenetic marks anew. Those periods when the entire epigenome
gets reorganized are called “sensitive periods”. One of them is in early
embrionic development, soon after the fertilization of an egg and a sperm. The
second one strts in mid-gestation, when the formation of the germ cells is
initiated in the embryo. It can last till the adolescense, when germ cells are
mature. If a patient is treated with a drug that changes their DNA-methylation
pattern during one of the sensitive periods, the resulting changes will affect
also their children and grandchildren and is particularly inadvisable.
