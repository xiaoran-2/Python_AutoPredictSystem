    <div class="field-value">Majority of DNA methylation takes place in CpG islands that are multiple C (cytosine) and G (guanine) separated by one phosphate (C-p-G) repeats next to a gene area. These islands are on both strands of DNA, they are stable and therefore mitotically heritable (transfer via cell division) epigenetic markers that silence gene transcription. CpG islands are hypomethylated and contribute to gene expression. Some are specific to cell type, being methylated or unmethylated to contribute to cell function.<br /><br />In cancerous cells, overall methylation decreases, while becoming more dense in some CpG islands. It is observed that specific alleles are hypermethylated, normally silencing tumor-suppressing genes. On the other hand, methylation in repeats and gene introns (inorganic regions that are "spliced" during transcription) is hypomethylated.<br /><br />These changes in DNA methylation which ensures that DNA is properly replicating and transcriptionally consistent with cell function, as well as suppresses the expression of any potentially harmful viral sequences or transposons that may have integrated into DNA repeats, interfere with transcriptional processes that are vital to cell development and function. Methylation changes also affect chromatin and interfere with DNA regulation of mutations and developmental change in cell function.<br /><br />While methylated, intergenic regions and repetitive elements contribute to genomic stability. Intergenic methylation also prevents transcription inconsistencies from happening such as when transcription in both directions can be disrupted when two genes close to each other are transcribed at the same time. Repetitive elements called transposons can jump around the DNA and recombine with other sections when the chromatin is open and they are not methylated. In cancer, methylation changes allow for this to happen leading to duplications, recombinations (reciprocal translocation) and insertions between chromosomes that cause changes in gene expression. Jumping around, these elements can disrupt transcribed genes by jumping into a coding region or activating gene transcription. <br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes that often lead to leukemia that is resistant to treatment. One of the epigenetic features of this disease is chromosomal abnormalities, including chromosomal translocations and abnormal chromosome number. Testing the clonal cells shows that the cells loose their ability to differentiate due to loss of epigenetic marks. The resulting APL leukemia is associated with the hypothesis of multiple stress factors being responsible for cancerous diseases. One of the problems decitabine solves is reducing chromatin closing  allowing certain hypermethylated genes to be transcribed.<br /><br />As an example in blood cell cancer leukemia, as in other cancers, tumor-suppressing methylation and methylation responsible for mitotic heritability can be hypermethylated. The active molecule helps reduce chromatin related silencing of genes, especially affecting the apoptosis pathway that is responsible for cell death in the case of extreme stress or mutations that are dangerous for cell function.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">IGF2 or Insulin Growth Factor 2 is encoded in both paternal and maternal alleles, but is methylated in the paternal allele, therefore being called an "imprinted" gene because it is defined by sex. The h19/lgf2 cluster helps regulate growth in embryo development due to conflicting "interests" between the parents - paternal desire to embryo growth and maternal desire for self-preservation. IGF2 speeds up growth and cell division while H19 slows growth down. IGF2 gene is active during embryo development and it's expression slows down after birth. When IGF2 slows down, H19 is expressed. The regulation is maintained through an enhancer (CTCF chromatin protein)  that interacts with the chromatin causing difficulty for RNA polymerase to attach to promoter and skipping to the H19 gene.<br /><br /><span>Some diseases like BWS are due to hypermethylation of this area (methylation on both paternal and maternal alleles). In some cancers methylation marks are lost, also known as loss of imprinting (LOI). An increased amount of insulin-like growth factor 2 may stimulate the growth of tumor cells and prevent damaged cells from being destroyed. Film's tumor is a cancer of kidneys mostly found in children and is considered to be related to loss of imprinting as explained above.</span><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Some epigenetic regulation has been shown to be myopically heritable, even though that evidence is not conclusive in humans. However, it has been shown that epigenetic regulation is mitotically heritable, having lasting impact on organ development. Organ variations (differentiation), embryo development, growth regulation and specific gene activation or silencing depending on environment are all under epigenetic regulation.<br /><br />In embryo development, epigenetic marks are cleared and then re-established. For example, in male sperm, due to the need of movement, most epigenetic marks are cleared. Several stages of development of an embryo are critical for clearing and re-establishment of epigenetic marks, therefore making this period a very sensitive time for epigenetic drugs. These periods mostly relate to the mother, but also affect the father in pre-conception stage.  After fertilization, demethylation of both maternal and paternal marks occurs and then de novo methylation occurs in the blastocyst stage. It has been shown that a mother's diet or smoking can affect epigenetic disposition towards stress response or obesity in children. <br /><br />My understanding would be that sensitive periods of demethylation and methylation involved in forming the zygote develop into function-specific organs as well as conception are the times when these epigenetic drugs can severely interfere.</div>
