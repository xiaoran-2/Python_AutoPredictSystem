    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>During
normal function of a differentiated cell (adult cell), there are a high
percentage of CpG islands that are methylated, because they are not used in the
maintenance of maintaining the life of the adult cell. In cancer,
there is an increase of DNA methylation (hypermethylation) in some CpG islands
of tumor suppressor genes, which would normally be unmethylated and expressed.
Furthermore, there is a low DNA methylation (hypomethylation) of some CpG islands,
CpG islands shores, and at CpG poor promoters. This
disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer because the genes
responsible for suppressing tumor growth are silenced and the oncogenes are
unmethylated and therefore allow the cell to grow at a higher rate than a
normal cell would. This phenomenon is explained in the Knudson hypothesis, which states that tumor cells are the result of mutations or “insults”
to the DNA of a cell.</p><p>There is
also a high amount of hypermethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive
elements in a normal functioning cell. This is because many of the repetitive regions are not used in the maintenance of maintaining the life
of the adult cell. These
changes to the genome creates an abnormal karyotypes in cancer cells which are
detectable due to the number of deletions, insertions, and reciprocal
translocations that occur. One cause for these changes is the illegitimate
recombination between repeats. Also,
the abnormal methylation of the region can cause the activation of
repeats, which result in transpositions. Finally, the activation of cryptic
promoters disrupt neighboring genes and change the gene activation in the
region resulting in an abnormal gene expression in the cell.</p>
















<p>It should be noted that DNA methylation is context dependent on the type of cell in question and how it contributes to a specific type of tumorigenesis.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">On the paternal allele in a normal cell, the ICR is unmethylated, which allows CTCF to bind to it. CTCF is an insulator protein that insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. This allows for the enhancement of H19 and results in the lack of expression of Igf2 on the paternal allele. On the maternal allele in a normal cell, the ICR is methylated and therefore CTCF cannot bind, which allows the enhancers downstream of the Igf2 to promote Igf2 expression. Furthermore, DNA methylation spreads upstream of H19, which silences its gene expression. The result of this is an expression of Igf2 on the maternal allele. <br /><span><br />In Wilm's tumor, both the maternal and paternal alleles have methylation of ICR, which </span>increases Igf2 expression by two fold compared to a normal functioning cell. Also, the DNA methylation upstream of H19, which silences its gene expression of H19. The disruption of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer because one of the functions of H19 is the limiting of cell proliferation and it is not expressed in these cells. Also, Igf2 is a growth promoting gene and in the case of Wilm's tumor is overly expressed causing tumorigenesis. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a replication dependent DNMTi epigenetic inhibitor, and it is one of four FDA approved epigenetic drugs. Decitabine is a nucleoside analoge which irreversibly binds to DNMTs which decrease the amount of DNA methylation (hypomethylation) of tumor cells as the cells divide. Although the mechanism of action for Decitabine is unknown, at the appropriate dosage can stop the hypermethylation of specific regions that promote cancer growth. Today it is used to treat <span>myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), but there is research to expend it for use in other tumor types. </span>    </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Alterations to DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and therefore changes to the DNA methylation of a cell will last beyond the lifetime of that cell and live on in subsequent generations. In many ways this is favorable for cancer treatment, however there are certain sensitive periods for some cells that this effect would have a negative impact.<br />There are two sensitive periods which a large impact on the cell, the pre-implantation/ early development phase and the primordial germ cell development. An example of these would be the early stages of embryogenesis and production/maturation of egg and sperm cells. Therefore women who have recently become pregnant and the final stages of egg and sperm cell development in men and women. These sensitive periods experience large epigenetic reprogramming changes to the cell (large changes of DNA methylation), and when disturbed can have a lasting impact on the cell. It would be inadvisable to treat patients during sensitive periods because the drug can effect the critical methylation of certain regions of the genome needed for normal cell imprinting/reprogramming. </div>
