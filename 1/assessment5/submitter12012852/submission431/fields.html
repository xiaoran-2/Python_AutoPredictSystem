    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are frequently located within the promoter regions of the genes and their methylation state often corresponds with activity of these genes. If CpG island is heavy methylated then it's likely that transcrption level of the gene will be low and vice versa. In cancer cells CpG regions are more likely to be hypermethylated, in particular, regions that are located within the promoters of the tumor supressor genes. Thus decreasing the defence ability of the cell. Also there are some data that CpG islands of the oncogenes are hypomethylated and this contributes to the higher exression rate of the oncogenes. <br /><span>DNA methylation of repetitive elements in normals cells prevents their expression thus increasing genomic stabillity and methylation of intergenic regions keeps the transcription noise at a low level silencing the sites of alternative transcription, moreover intergenic methylaton may change the ability of protein binding(e.g. TF) or lncRNA binding and possibly marks some splice sites. In cancer cell intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be hypomethylated.This leads to low genomic stabilliity, high mutation rate and changes in the expression pattern of the cell, partly because of transpositions of repetitive elements. They are often have alternative transcription sites and their insertion into the promoter of the gene may lead to its expression. Also insertion into the exon of the gene can disrupt it and the product of the gene would no longer carry out its functions.<br /></span><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The H19/Igf2 cluster consists of two genes <b>Igf2</b> (Insulin-like growth factor 2) whose role is to promote growth and proliferation of the cells and <b>H19</b> (lncRNA) that regulates expression of number of genes, <b>imprint control region</b> (ICR) that is located between these genes and enhancers that lie downstream H19 and can affect transcription of either H19 or Igf2. <br />ICR on the paternal allele is methylated preventing binding of CTCF insulator. Therefore CTCF doesn't insulate the activity of downstream enhancers on Igf2 and Igf2 is expressed. H19 is silenced by promoter methylation on the paternal allele.<br />On the maternal allele ICR is <b>un</b>methylated, CTCF binds ICR and prevent transcription of Igf2. H19 is expressed.<br />In Wilm's tumor the loss of heterozygosity occurs and maternal allele methylation pattern transformed into that of paternal allele. Hence we have two paternal allele, there are twice as much Igf2 and literally no H19. Provided great quantity of Igf2 cancer cells will proliferate at high rate.<br /><br />Literature:<br /><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC42443/pdf/pnas01484-0375.pdf" title="Link: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC42443/pdf/pnas01484-0375.pdf">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC42443/pdf/pnas01484-0375.pdf</a></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine (Dacogen, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) is inhibitor of the DNA methyltransferases. It's a cytidine analog and act like Azacitidine (Vidaza) save for one moment, decitabine is deoxy<span>ribonucleoside and unlike azacitidine doesn't incorporate into RNA.<br />Decitabine incorporates into DNA of the cells with </span>high proliferation rate (e.g. cancer cells) during cell divisions (DNA replication). Trying to methylate decitabine DNMT covalently binds to it and then failed to break this band like it happens when normal cytidine is methylated. Thus enzyme remains bound to DNA and can't no longer fulfill its functions. This leads to passive demethylation through cell divisions.<br />As it was discussed earlier in Q1, CpG islands in the promoter regions of the tumor supressor genes became hypermethylated ang these genes became silenced. Blocking methylation, decitabine is restoring transcription of the tumor supressor genes, thus allowing the cell to return to its normal cell cycle or to undergo apoptosis.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Standard chemotherapy treatment causes damage of different sorts to DNA and disrups other cell processes thus encouraging cell to kill itself . In cancer cells mechanisms that promote self-destruction if the damage is too high are turned off.  Drugs that alter DNA methylation (usually decreasing the methylation level) can restore the "system of cell defence" (by demethylation of the promoters of the tumor supressor genes) enabling it to cause apoptosis if the damage to the cell is unbearable and it can't be repaired. <br />There are two sensitive periods: the first during early embriogenesis and the second during germ cell development when treatment with these epigenetic drugs should be avoid. In these periods there is reestablishment of epigenetic marks (in this case DNA methylation) and epigenetic drugs can disrupt these processes leading to developmental abnormalities. Therefore pregnant females and children (during period of germ cells development) shouldn't be treated with such drugs.</div>
