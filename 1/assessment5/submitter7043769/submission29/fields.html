    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value">The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to silence the gene expression. For instance, a female X chromosome which is inactivated is methylated at CpG islands so that male and female have the same number of active X chromosome.<br />However, DNA hypermethylation of CpG islands can also silences tumour suppressor genes which prevent cancer. If it occurs, the normal tissue will be growth unusually. Then, the tumour will be formed.<br />Since tumour maybe the symbol of cancer, DNA hypermethylation of CpG islands, which silences tumour suppressor genes, contributes to cancer.<br /><span>The role of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to silence some genes that cause instability. For example, cells without mathylated will cause genomic instability.<br />If </span>DNA hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer, chromosomes in the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell will be different than normal. For example, some type of chromosomes will increase in number and some types of chromosomes will be damaged.<br />Since chromosomal instability cause depletion of DNA methylation which enhance tumorigenesis, DNA hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In paternal allele, the methylation of imprint control region prevent combination of CTCF, which is the insulator protein,and thus <span>the enhancers usually increase Igf2 expression.<br />In maternal allele, the </span>imprint control region is not methylated. CTCF combine with the imprint control region. Moreover, enchancers, which cannot promote Igf2 expression due to CTCF blocking, promote H19 expression instead and thus silence Igf2 expression.<br />Lose of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster lead to methylation of imprint control region at maternal allele. That increases Igf2 expression and hence form <span>Wilm’s tumour.<br /></span>Imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster can cause more expression on growth promoting genes and less expression on growth restricting genesis. These event is usually seen before cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to DNMT1(<span>DNA methyltransferase) inhibitors.<br />Decitabine unite with DNA strands to inhibit </span>DNA methyltransferase. Thus, it reduces DNA methylation. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decitabine#Mechanism" title="Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decitabine#Mechanism">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decitabine#Mechanism</a>)<br />DNA methylation may be one of the reason to express genes that make tumour become against drug. Decitabine which reduce DNA methylation will decrease expression of those genes and let the tumour or cancer become easier for drug treatment.<br />(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23060570" title="Link: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23060570">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23060570</a>)</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation will cause epigenetic change on daughter and granddaughter cells. As a result, <span>enduring effects occur on the epigenome.<br />Sensitive period is the period of create </span>epigenetic marks.<br /><span>The periods from pre-implantation development to germ cell development are sensitive periods of development.<br /></span>During sensitive periods, altering DNA methylation may not only cause epigenetic change but also the health of patient's generation which is proved on mouse. Thus, patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable to this drug treatment to prevent disease like diabetes and heart attack. </div>
