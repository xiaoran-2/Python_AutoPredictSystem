    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation acts as a repressive epigenetic mark, and is associated with gene silencing and heterochromatin.  In normal cells, CpG islands tend to be unmethylated, while intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be methylated.  In cancer, there tends to be a reversal of these normal methylation states, with CpG islands being methylated, while intergenic regions and repeats tend to be unmethylated.<br /><br />CpG island methylation in normal cells can be associated with imprinted gene silencing.  in cancer, CpG island metylation could lead to silencing of tumor suppressors.<br /><br />In normal cells, methylation of intergenic regions and repeats helps with genomic stability and chromosome packaging.  Hypomethylation of these regions can lead to illegitimate recombination, transposition of repeats, and activation of oncogenes.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Disruption of imprinting is a common feature in cancer.  Imprinting results in parent-of-origin specific expression of imprinted genes, and disruption can result in overexpression of oncogenes or underexpression of tumor suppressors.  An example of this is the H19/Igf2 cluster.  It is paternally imprinted, resulting in methylation of the ICR and also CpG sites in the H19 promoter on the paternal allele.<br /><br />On the paternal allele, methylation of the ICR blocks binding of the insulator protein CTCF.  This allows distal enhancers to activate IGF2 expression.  The H19 promoter is also methylated, blocking H19 expression.<br /><br />On the maternal allele, the opposite is the case.  The ICR is unmethylated, allowing CTCF to bind and insulate Igf2 from the enhancers.  The enhancers then are able to act upon the unmethylated H19 to drive expression.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumor, loss of imprinting results in effectively having two paternal alleles.  This gives increased IGF2 expression and no H19 expression.  IGF2 is an oncogene, promoting growth.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent approved for use in myelodysplastic syndromes.  It is a nucleoside analogue that incorporates into the DNA during replication, then binds DNMTs irreversibly; thus preventing DNA methylation.  It depends on cell division to dilute methylation rather than direct demethylation.  It can be effective against cancers that depend on hypermethylation of tumor suppressors, reversing the hypermethylation and reactivating the suppressors.  Since cancer cells divide rapidly, it will affect them more than noncancerous cells.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation patterns are mitotically heritable.  So, when DNA methylation is altered by drugs, that alteration persists in the daughter cells even after treatment is stopped.  As such, caution must be taken when using such drugs.  There are periods of epigenetic reprogramming that could be severely disrupted if treatment were given.  Early embryonic development and primordial germ cell development are the greatest examples of sensitive periods.  Treatment during these periods could result in epigenetic disorders or even mortality.<br /></div>
