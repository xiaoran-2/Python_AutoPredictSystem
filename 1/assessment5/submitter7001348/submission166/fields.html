    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells CpG
islands are generally protected from methylation. They are often
found at gene promoters and their methylation results in silencing of
the underlying gene. In cancer cells we observe hypermethylation of CpG
islands, especially those located in promoters of tumour suppressor
genes. Those changes lead
to the uncontrolled cell growth that causes cancer.</p><p>At the same time
there is a high level of methylation at  intergenic regions and
repetitive elements in normal cells. This provides silencing of
cryptic transcription and splice sites, but also prevents
transposition or illegitimate recombination. In cancer we find
genome-wide hypomethylation, including  intergenic regions and
repetitive elements. This results in their activation and thereby
genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Igf2 is one of the so-called imprinted genes. It belongs to the H19/Igf2 cluster, which is
regulated by enhancer blocking. In this cluster, ICR is methylated on the paternal allele which results in Igf2 expression. At the same time the maternal copy is unmethylated and Igf2 is not expressed from this
allele. This ensures correct dose of Igf2 in cells.</p><p>In Wilm's tumour,
this pattern is disrupted - both copies of the H19/Igf2 cluster
behave like the paternal one (or the maternal one is lost), which results in
Igf2 being overexpressed. As Igf2 is a growth regulator, its
overexpression leads to uncontrolled growth and predispose to
childhood tumours.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs
to methyltransferase inhibitors. It blocks a DNMT enzyme and prevents DNA
methylation in dividing cells. In cancer treatment, it can be used to
revert hypermethylation of CpG islands and activate underlying tumour
suppressor genes. Although decitabine is not specific for those
genes, it affects only dividing cells and is less harmful for normal
tissues.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a very stable epigenetic mark. It is maintained during cell's life but
also mitotically heritable, which means that it is passed to daughter
cells during division. That means epigenetic changes will be found in
all cells originating from cells affected by anti-cancer drugs. Taking it
into account, we should avoid treating patients with such drugs
during the so-called sensitive periods. A sensitive period is
a time in organism's life when epigenetic marks are genome-wide
reseted, i.e. early embryonic development and primordial germ cell
development. During those periods influence of the environment on the
epigenome is very significant and can cause large-scale, lasting
changes. Therefore we should not treat pregnant women and children
with drugs that alter the epigenetic state. In the case of pregnant women
such treatment could affect embryo, while in the case of children it
could alter germ cell development. In both of these cases, abnormalities in
epigenome would be passed to patients' children and have influence on their whole life.</p></div>
