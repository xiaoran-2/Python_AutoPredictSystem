    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The expression of <span>Igf2, a growth promoter, requires activation by enhancers located downstream of the H19/Igf2 cluster's imprint control region (ICR).  This particular ICR is normally <i>paternally</i> imprinted, meaning the paternal ICR is methylated.  Methylation at this ICR prevents the protein complex CTCF from binding at the site, so the enhancers have clear access to Igf2, and it is expressed (from the paternal allele).  On the maternal allele, however, CTCF normally <i>does</i> bind, as the ICR is unmethylated.  This then prevents Igf2 expression (from the maternal allele) due to the enhancers being blocked.<br /><br />In the case of Wilms' tumor, a childhood kidney disease, the maternal allele is also methylated, thus behaving in the same manner as the paternal allele (no CTCF binding), resulting in both alleles expressing Igf2.  This abnormal (double) imprinting causes overexpression of Igf2 -- and as it is a growth promoter, results in the kidney tumor.<br /><br /></span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value">One of the fundamental characteristics of epigenetics is DNA
    methylation: the laying down of a methyl group on the cytosine of a
    CpG dinucleotide pair.  This methylation is mitotically heritable
    and affects chromatin structure and gene activation/silencing.<br /><br />
    Epigenetics research has determined that a normal genome has average
    patterns of DNA methylation -- typically, CpG islands (at gene
    promoters) are unmethylated while intergenic regions, repetitive
    elements and introns have DNA methylation scattered throughout.  The
    lack of methylation at CpG islands leaves the associated gene
    promoters active, while the methylation in the other areas is a
    hallmark of inactivity.  Methylation in repetitive elements also
    promotes chromosomal stability and genetic integrity by preventing
    mutagenic transposition, transcriptional interference and
    illegitimate recombination.  In fact, according to Timothy Bestor,
    the primary function of DNA methylation is to protect the genome
    from the damage which can by done by transposable elements.<br /><br />
    In cancer, these two patterns are switched, resulting in
    <i>hyper</i>methylation at CpG islands (and CpG island shores), while the
    repeats and other intergenic regions become <i>hypo</i>methylated.  The
    increased methylation of CpG islands is associated with gene
    silencing, particularly of tumor suppressor genes.  The decreased
    methylation in repetitive elements and intergenic regions leads to
    genomic instability -- the lack of appropriate methylation can
    result in chromosomal deletions, insertions, duplications and
    reciprocal translocations, as well as transcriptional interference,
    mutagenic transposition and illegitimate recombination.  Any of these insults can lead to cancer by disrupting normal cell function -- genetic or epigenetic or both -- causing silencing of tumor suppression, increasing oncogene expression, etc.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Many pharmaceutical companies are developing small molecule
    inhibitors to target epigenetic machinery, to help treat cancer via
    epigenetic alterations.  One class of these drugs works to inhibit
    DNA Methyl Transferases (DNMTs); a drug in this class is called a
    DNA Methyl Transferase Inhibitor, or DNMTi.  Decitabine is one such DNMTi drug, already approved by the FDA for cancer treatment.<br /><br />
    Decitabine permanently binds to DNMTs such that in cell replication,
    DNA methylation (normally put down as copies on daughter strands by DNMTs) is subsequently prevented.  Dividing cells then have continually reduced DNA
    methylation.<br /><br />DNA hypermethylation in cancer which causes failure to express tumor
    suppressing genes would be reduced or removed in dividing cells in the presence of Decitabine -- thus enabling these genes again to
    do their tumor suppressing work.  In this way, Decitabine targets
    malignancies caused by hypermethylation of tumor suppressor
    promoters.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cell division (mitosis), DNA methylation is copied from
    the parent strand to the daughter strand.  This is the basis for
    mitotic heritability in epigenetics.  A drug that alters DNA
    methylation can thus have long term effects on the epigenome by
    disrupting the laying down of <em>copied</em> epigenetic marks -- as
    subsequent generations of cells would not have the original marks to
    copy, even when the drug itself is no longer present.<br /><br />
    It is important to note that drugs that alter DNA methylation will
    affect cells whenever DNA methylation is being laid down.  Which is
    not only during normal cell division (mitosis) but also during the
    "sensitive periods" of primordial germ cell development, early
    embryonic development, and specific stages of cell differentiation.<br /><br />
    During these sensitive periods, DNA methylation is erased and laid
    down anew in specific (and important) ways for proper cell functioning.  Inhibiting DNA methylation during this active remodeling
    could have severe deleterious consequences; thus it would be
    inadvisable to treat patients with such drugs at those times.</div>
