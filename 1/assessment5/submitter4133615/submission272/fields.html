    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer is associated
with hypermethylation of localized specific DNA regions (such as CpG islands in
some gene’s promoter region) and genome-wide hypomethylation in comparison to
normal cells.</p><p>Methylations of CpG
islands in genes promoter are generally associated with gene silencing. CpG
islands in promoter of growth suppressor genes are unmethylated during cell’s
normal functioning, which allows regulation of uncontrolled cell growth and division.
In cancerous cells, methylation of these CpG islands (which also influencing
methylation of CpG islands shores) silences these genes, which consequently results
in cells abundant growth and division.</p>

<p>In normal functioning
cell methylation serves a role of maintaining genomic stability among others. Repetitive
sequences such as satellite repeats and remnants of retroviral infections are
methylated. In cancerous cells global level of methylation decreases, which results
in illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and
transpositions, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighboring
genes. This may lead to abnormal karyotype: deletions, reciprocal translocations,
insertions.</p>

<p>Changes in methylation
could also disturb usually imprinting genomic regions (see next question for
example) or influence expression of genes (as, for example, R-RAS in gastric
cancer) or microRNA (as, for example, miR21 targeting tumor suppressor PTEN in
glioma) through CpG poor promoters.</p>

<span>All these changes vary
between different types of cancer, resulting in large cancer heterogeneity.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>In paternal allele, methylation
of imprinting control region (ICR) prohibits CTCF-dependent insulator from
binding, which allows expression of growth promoting Igf2 and also silencing
H19. While in maternal allele, ICR is unmethylated, which result in its binding
by insulator and results in preventing of accessing Igf2 (i.e. it’s silencing),
while influencing expression of H19 (which has a role in negative regulation of
cell proliferation) at the same time. In Wilm’s tumor both alleles acts as paternal
(i.e. both ICRs are methylated), which results in double dose expression of
growth factor Igf2, while also simultaneously inhibiting expression of H19.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug
against <span>DNA
methyltransferase, i.e. DNMT inhibitor (DNMTi). It is division dependant (i.e. need
to have cell replicating), since it irreversibly binds DNMTs after they are
incorporated into DNA. Since cancer cells divide more than other, they are more
severely affected. Decitabine influences reduction of methylation through the genome.
It is approved for use in myelodysplastic syndrome, which is known to be
dependent on CpG islands hypermethylation. I.e. decitabine might decrease level
of methylation in CpG islands, which consequently activates growth suppressor genes.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Since DNA methylation
patterns are mitotically heritable, drugs that alter DNA methylation could have effects that last
beyond the period of drug treatment. Thus one needs to be cautious, when given
such drugs to children with germ cell development or during <span>sensitive periods, such as embryogenesis and
early life, during which the epigenome is more susceptible and can be disrupted
by environmental or other factors, which could affect that drug induced changes
will be transferred to later life and probably to next generations.</span></p></div>
