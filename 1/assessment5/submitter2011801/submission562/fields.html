    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are found in a significant number of promoters (60%
approximately). In normal cells these CpG islands tend to be unmethylated. But
in cancer cells, these regions become hypermethylated which is the cause of the
silence of the gene. In these cases, the reason why DNA methylation in CpG
island contributes to cancer is because the hypermethylation of tumour
suppresors. In fact, with the progression of time the CpG island methylation
increases till the metastasis and invasion states. </p>

<p>In the case of intergenic and repetitive elements, normal cells have
these regions methylated in order to maintain genomic stability. But
unfortunately, in cancer cells there is hypomethylation causing these regions
to become active and therefore the cause of genomic instability, for example
alteration in the number of repeats in the case of repetitive elements, wrong
combination between repeats, transposition and activation of promoters and
disruption of genes near to these elements. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the case of the paternal allele the ICR (imprinted control region) is
methylated. This methylation spreads over H19 region. In this condition, CTCF
can´t bind the ICR. Therefore the enhancers (downstream of ICR) act in the Igf2
gene which is found upstream. As result the expression of the Igf2 gene. In
contrast, in the maternal allele the ICR remains unmethylated, and for that
reason the CTFC can bind to this region. The consequence of this condition the
enhancers do not go upstream to the Igf2 and go to the expression of H19 region
instead. In the case of Wilm´s tumour, both ICR are hypermethylated, therefore
acting like both paternal alleles. So, there is an overexpression of Igf2 gene.
Disruption of this cluster can lead to cancer due to the loss of expression of
growth gene and overexpression of growth promoting genes. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs in the class DNMTi, which is an inhibitor of the
enzyme that brings methylation. Therefore this drug causes DNA demethylation.
It is important to mention that the use of this kind of drugs at very low doses
can result into anti-neoplastic effect, because they are causing the demethylation
of suppressor genes.  But at higher doses
this drug can have a very toxic effect. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The alteration of DNA methylation can have permanent effects on the
epigenome due to the establishment of the epigenetic marks in the sensitive periods.
There are periods of times that become essential for the rest of our life,
these are called sensitive periods: The early embryonic development and
primordial germ cells. During these stages, there are two waves of
reprogramming, the first stage corresponding to the maternal and paternal
genome and the removal of imprinting genes during the second wave. Once these
all epigenetic marks have been established they become metastable and
mitotically heritable. That means, that these marks will remain that way for
the entire lifespan of the organism. </p>

<span>Treating the patients with effects in DNA
methylation during these sensitive periods is not advisable, because there can
be alteration in the establishment of the epigenetic marks in the waves of
reprogramming. Because there can be a disruption in the primordial germ cell,
the treatment will not only affect the patient, but also the second and even
the third generation. All these consequences should be considered for this kind
of treatment. </span></div>
