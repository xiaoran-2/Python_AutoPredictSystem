    <div class="field-value">The pattern of DNA methylation in cancer is the reverse of what it is in normal cells. those regions of the DNA such as the intergenic regions and repetitive sequence that are normally methylated in the normal somatic cell become demethylated while the specific loci, which are marked by the CpG islands, become methylated. In cancer the methylation that is of the greatest concern is that which affects the CpG island of the tumour suppressor genes. Normally the function  of the methylation at these CpG islands is to make sure that genes that encode tumour suppressor proteins such as p53 are expressed enough to prevent the cell from becoming cancerous. The distribution of the methylation at the CpG islands is also a very important factor, as in some cancers there are very specific CpG islands that are affected, the identification of which can actually be used identify the sub-type of the cancer. In addition to this, if there is higher demethylation at certain CpG islands that are associated with oncogenes then these oncogenes will be expressed to a greater degree thus increasing the risk of cancer. The characteristic genome wide hypomethylation that occurs in cancer ensures that some of the hypomethylated regions will encompass the CpG island of oncogenes. With regards to the methylation of the intergenic and repetitve regions of the DNA, they are normally methylated, as their demethylation often results in genomic instability. This allows the rest of the genome's transcription to operate properly. In cancer the methylation of these regions are disrupted because of the action of methyl-tranferases, which may result from the degradation of the DNA as a result of ageing, or through carcinogenic and mutagenic effects of outside systems. The action of all the listed factors need additional insults to DNA to cause cancer's development.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The imprinted genes of an organism serve an important purpose in regulating the organism in such a way as is expedient to the organism's survival in a certain environment, which has been recognised by the imprinting of genes. Therefore the disruption of this imprinting may yield an organism that is not suited to its environment. The organism may be more exposed to carcinogens because of this poor suitability. Imprints are also responsible for preventing the expression of nearby genes through preventing the binding of CTCF, which can cause genome instability linked to cancer. On the paternal
allele because the ICR is methylated the enhancers can bind to the IGF and it
will be expressed.

















When an ICR is
unmethylated the CTCF will bind, which will cause the enhancers to act on H19
gene that is a number of kb away from the ICR. IGF will then be silent, such is the mechanism with regards to the maternal allele. When the paternal allele is affected and IGF-II expressed it will cause the methylation of the maternal allele's ICR as well, which will result in Wilm’s tumour since Wilm's tumour requires that both the maternal allele and the paternal allele express IGF-II.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belong to the class of drugs called DNMT-inhibitors. This drug treats effectively because ensuring that the methylation pattern characteristic of cancer is down-regulated means disallowing the transfer of methyl groups (which would silence) to the loci of the DNA that are associated with tumour suppressor genes. Therefore it is able to prevent the wild methylation of the tumour suppressor genes that can lead to the cell becoming senescent and eventually cancerous. Because of this drug the methylation pattern is closer to that of normal cells and therefore the cells being affected by the drug can continue to function like normal cells. With the action of proteins such as p53 that have an anti-tumourigenesis effect being allowed by the fact that the DNA region that codes for them is un-methylated due to decitabine, the cell is unlikely to develop into a cancerous cell, which would divide to form a tumour. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Once the epigenome has been altered during a sensitive period its characteristic are mitotically heritable. All cells henceforth will hold the marks caused by methylation. A sensitive period is a period of an organisms genetic development that is characterised by demethylation to allow the expression of certain genes that must be expressed for a short time and then switched off again to ensure that the organism develops properly. Such period include the periods of early embryonic development (around the blastocyst stage) and primordial germ cell development, which is nearer to the end of embryonic development. It is highly inadvisable to administer treatment during these periods because the effects of the drugs applied to a passing condition could be permanent, causing disease. With regards to the imprinted genes, the period of sensitivity is different. They are sensitive only in the primordial germ cell development stage. As such, the environment will affect the embryo during this period in those genomic areas that have imprinted genes, as they are demethylated at this point. Treating patients during sensitive periods could lead to lifelong effects that would greatly lower the organisms standard of life because the drugs used could force abnormal regulation of certain elements. </div>
