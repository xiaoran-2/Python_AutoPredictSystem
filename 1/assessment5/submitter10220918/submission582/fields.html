    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>The role of DNA methylation in cancer is
context dependent. This methylation can occur in different parts of the genome:
CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements.</p>

<p>In the normal cell, the level of methylation of
CpG islands is usually low, which allows normal gene expression. However, high
levels of methylation at CpG islands are observed in cancer cells causing
silencing in the expression of some important genes. The way this
hypermethylation of CpG islands contributes to cancer is inhibiting the
expression of tumor suppressor genes.</p>

<p>If we now focus on methylation at intergenic
regions and repetitive elements, in normal cells, we see that these parts of
the genome are highly methylated, maintaining the genomic integrity in this
way. Nevertheless, it has been reported genome-wide hypomethylation in cancer
cells. These low levels of methylation lead to genomic instability, and
therefore, contributing to cancer in this way. This genomic instability can
contribute to cancer in some different ways: creating illegitimate
recombination between repeats, activating repeats and transposition or
activating cryptic promoters who disrupt neighbouring genes. All of these
events can lead to deletions, insertions or reciprocal translocations.</p>

<p><span>In summary, DNA methylation is highly altered
in cancer. There is <b>hypermethylation of
CpG islands</b> which leads to silencing of tumor suppressor genes, and there
is also <b>genome-wide hypomethylation</b>,
which leads to genomic instability, and consequently, enhancement of
tumorigenesis.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting is the epigenetic phenomenon
by which certain genes are expressed in a parent-of-origin-specific manner. There
are some clusters of genes throughout the genome that are imprinted by imprint
control regions (ICRs).</p>

<p>One of these clusters is H19/Igf2 cluster, in
which imprinting is caused by enhancer blocking. In normal cells, on the
maternal allele, ICR is not methylated, which allows the insulation of Igf2
from downstream enhancers by the protein CTFC, therefore, Ifg2 is always
silenced on the maternal allele and H19 is expressed. However, on the paternal
allele, the ICR is methylated, therefore, DNA methylation spreads to H19
promoter to silence and the protein CTFC cannot insulate Igf2, so enhancers can
now access to Igf2 leading to activation of this gene.</p>

<p>It has been reported that imprinting of this
cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumor. In this case, both ICRs in the paternal
and maternal alleles are methylated. This leads to Igf2 overexpression since
now there are two active copies of the gene instead of one.</p>

<p><span>Therefore, disrupting imprinting at the
H19/Igf2 cluster results in overexpression of a growth promoting gene (Igf2),
contributing to cancer development in this way.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a FDA approved drug used in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome. Among all the epigenetic inhibitors, it belongs to the <strong>DNMTi</strong> class (DNA MethylTransferase inhibitors). It works as a <strong>DNA demethylation agent</strong>. It is a nucleoside analogue that binds to DNMTs irreversibly after they are incorporated to DNA and therefore, reducing the methylation rates.<br /><br />Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect in the type of cancers where hypermethylation occur, like myelodysplastic syndromes. In these type of cancers, hypermethylation leads to silencing of tumour suppressor genes. Using decitabine would decrease the rate of methylation at the promoters of these tumour suppressor genes, and therefore, this would lead to the normal expression of these genes. <br /><br />However, decitabine should not be used in cancers where hypomethylation is a key event, since this drug would contribute even more to these hypomethylation.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that alter DNA methylation have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment because they cause epigenetic changes, and this changes are mitotically heritable, therefore, if these drugs produce an alteration in the DNA methylation, this will remain after cell division. <br /><br />There are some periods where we should avoid the use of these epigenetic drugs; the <strong>sensitive periods</strong>. These are the times where epigenetic reprogramming occur, removing all the previous epigenetic marks and setting new ones. There are two sensitive periods of development: one one the pre-implantation development of the embryo, and one during germ cell development. <br /><br />Use of epigenetic drugs should be avoided during these periods, because alterations in these process can result in life-lasting epigenetic abnormalities like aberrant imprinting.  <em></em></div>
