    <div class="field-value">Typicaly, CpG islands has certain level of methilation across the whole organism (nearly 70-80% in somatic mammalian cells), Particular pattern is specific to each particular tissue type. There are mny genes, which are control cell division and death and in general maintain tissue homeostasis. During cancerogenesis, CpG islands in promotors of some of those genes can be hypermethylated, and, respectively, genes will be silenced. After silencing, cell division will be disregulaed, and tissue will start to grow. Cells with disrupted division suppressors are tent to devide more often then normal once and produce more daughter cells. Epigenetic modifications are mitotcally stable, so neoplastic tissue will grow fast and without limits. Within genes themselves, methylation can play various roles including alternative splicing regulation, alternative start sites repression and ther types of transcribtion regulation. In cancer, those regions are mostly hypomethilated. This can lead to production of nonfunctional peptides instead of normal. If those peptides are related to cell proliferation processes, they can contribute in immortalization of cancer cells, unlimited division an spreading across the body.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normaly, paternal allele of the H19/lgf2 is highly methylated. This leads to silencing of the H19 promoter and activation of lgf2 expression via enchancers. In maternal allele, promoter has low level of methylation and is being expressed, which leads to lgf2 suppresssion. In many types of cancer, H19 is upregulated. This includes Wilm's tumor, type of kidney cancer. As proliferation regulator, H19 is related to cell division, angiogenesis, tumor invasion to the neighboring tissues. It can directly promote tumorogenesis in experiments on animals. In some type of cancer, increased H19 expression can be attributed to biallelic expression, which effectively means disrupted imprinting and expression from the paternal allele.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is DNA demethylating agent. So, its possible action is reduction of methylation in the CpG islands and reversion of the tumorogenic patterns of methylation. By reversion of methylation, drug can restore control of the division and methylation. In the very good case it probably can even promote apoptosys of some of the already generated tumor cells. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mostly mitotically stable, so once established, it can persist for a long time. It sort of difficult to change it and promote tumot growth, but if it already happened, it is also hard to reverse. However, if it is somehoe reversed by the drug, it will probably stay for a long time, probably during the lifespan. So, properties of DNA methylation make majority of manipulations with it long-lasting. However, there are few periods of natural reestablishment of the methylation. For majority of DNA, it happenes just after zygote formation and during germ cell proliferation. Also, some somatc tissues have their one critical periods, which are different for different tissue and affect much less DNA. Disruptions of those processes most probably will kill embrio or its germ cells (depending on the treatment time). Other possible outcome is massive developmental abnormalities, which are likely to happen in child of threated patient, if affected first critical period, or children of the child, if affected are germ cells. So, it is abad idea to treat pregnant women during early stages of the embrio formation, of course if drug can go through placenta to the fetus. Obviously, as we speak about cancer threatment, it is a hard question, what decision is the best solution in this case.</div>
