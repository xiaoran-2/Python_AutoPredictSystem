    <div class="field-value">According to Dr. Marnie Blewitt,DNA methylation of bases is analogue to gene silencing.Methylation of promotors and CpG islands is carried out to silence a gene when its function is not required.Inducible genes are regulated in this manner.In cancer or tumors,normal DNA methylation is shifted to hypermethylation due to epimutations, even leading to hypermethylation of CpG island shores.This disruption at CpG islands may silence the vital genes (e.g, tumor supressor gene),causing a neoplastic state of tissues.Hypomethylation of some CpG poor promotors may also lead to cancerous state by activating oncogenes (e.g, R-RAS).In normal cells,DNA methylation at repetitive elements and intergenic regions prevents recombination event between these repeats.Also the repeats and intergenic intevals are inactivated by DNA methylation.In cancer cells, normal DNA methylation of repetitive elements and intergenic intervals is shifted towards hypomethylation (by deletion of some methyl transferases) ,thus loosing the densely packaged chromatin.Hypomethylation at repeats and intergenic intervals leads to genomic instability by deletion,insertion and reciprocal translocation of chromosome parts,cosequently leading to cancer.In cancer development , both loss and gain of DNA methylation is observed,and contributes pathophysiologically by inactivating tumor suppressor genes,inducing genomic instability (Marcos E.H.,et el. July 2011).Thus either hypomethylation or hypermethylation of repeats and intergenic intervals,both can bring about aberrant cell growth as polypeptides formation after translation goes unregulated and production of non-functional proteins gets increased by many folds.It also affects the nuclear architecture,which is one of the diagnostic tool in cancer therapy.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Methylation patterns disruptions at Imprint Control Regions can result in either over expression of growth promoting genes or restriction of expression of genes by hypomethylation and hypermethylation respectively.Loss of imprinting by these genes leads to cancerous state of cell.Most imprinted genes are assigned with regulation of growth patterns of cell.Loss of imprinting disrupts the expression of imprinted genes and their product.lmprinted genes have monoallelic parent of origin.In cancer cells,due to loss of imprinting, such genes are either displayed or remain silent on both parental alleles.In normal cells' H19/Igf2 cluster,Igf2 is expressed on paternal allele but remain silent on maternal allele.On paternal allele,methylated ICRs allow enhancers to bind Igf2,resulting in Igf2 expression.While on maternal allele,ICR remain unmethylated,causing a protein CTCF to bind at ICR.Thus enhancers in this case cannot bind Igf2, rather they bind H19 thus leaving the Igf2 to remain silent on maternal allele.In cancer cells,due to loss of imprinting by hypermethylation at ICR of maternal allele, Igf2 is over expressed by maternal allele as well.Igf2 being a growth promoting gene, results in a condition called Wilm's tumor.Hypo- as well as hypermethylation of ICRs of imprinted genes can therefore result in tumorigenesis promoting cancer.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine (Dacogen),is an epigenetic drug,now being used as antineoplastic agent for human cancer therapy.It belongs to the class of DNA demethylating agents among other classes of epigenetic inhibitors.It affects the methylation patterns.<br /><b></b>IMPACT ON DNA METHYLATION: Regulation of gene expression is majorly governed by DNA methylation.Disruptions in this regulation can cause serious results.Decitabine works by demethylating or interfering the methylation of DNA at sites where hypermethylation has occured.It can only act on DNA strands and prevents methylation by inhibiting the function of DNA methyltransferase.<br />ANTI-TUMOR EFFECTS: When there is increased methylation of DNA strands (mainly by epimutations), it may block the normal function of "growth suppressing" genes that regulate the growth and division of cell.This blockage ultimately leads to unregulated cell division, promoting tumorigenesis.Demethylation by Decitabine restore the normal function of tumor suppressor genes,thus cell growth is maintained.Due to its anti-tumor effects,Decitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes.<br />Reference: <a href="http://chemocare.com/chemotherapy/drug-info/decitabine.aspx">http://chemocare.com/chemotherapy/drug-info/decitabine.aspx</a></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Speculating Dr.Baylin statement, anti-tumor drugs can have lasting effects by altering tumor cells epigenetically.Epigenetic drugs that restore DNA methylating patterns to normal,can have long-term impact on epigenome.As methylated DNA is passed on to daughter cells in several generations,until actively erased,it may carry therapeutic effects of drug with it.<br />SENSITIVE PERIOD: The period during which epigenetic marks are being established is sensitive period as stated by Dr. Marnie Blewitt.Specifically the stage of early embryonic development and germ cell development.It is the period during which the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms get extremely sensitive (Nagy, Turecki., 2012)<br />According to Dr. Patrick Western statement,<br />epigenetic programming in developing germ cell is susceptible to alterations by chemicals,diet and drugs.Altered epigenetic state can also be transmitted to next generations and may affect health and development of neonate.It may contribute to developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD).<br />Reference: <br /><a href="http://www.mrc-leu.soton.ac.uk/dohad/index.asp" title="Link: http://www.mrc-leu.soton.ac.uk/dohad/index.asp">http://www.mrc-leu.soton.ac.uk/dohad/index.asp</a> <br /><br /></div>
