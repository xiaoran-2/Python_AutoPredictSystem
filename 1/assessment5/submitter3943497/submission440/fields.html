    <div class="field-value">The function of DNA methylation at CpG islands to regulated the gene expression epigenetically by preventing the binding of transcription machinery to gene promoter regions and initiate transcription. The CpG islands are found to be methylated in cancer that presumed to inactivate the expression of tumor suppressor genes contributing to the development of cancer. The intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated in normal cell in order to prevent the transcription from the intergenic promoters and to restrict the transposition of transposon. The aberrant gene transcription from intergenic promoters can activate the potential silenced oncogenes. The intergenic regions are normally found to be methylated in normal cell while hypermethylation of these intergenic regions have been reported in cancer. The repetitive element are methylated in normal circumstances to prevent the transposition and genomic instability. These repetitive elements are hypomethylated in cancer that results in transposition to neighboring genes that play important role in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, cell growth etc.        </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The Igf2 has a growth promoting effects while H19 has growth restraining effects. The H19/Igf2 is an imprinting controlled genetic locus. The methylation status of imprinting controlling region (ICR) regulates the expression of this imprinting loci. The paternal derived  H19/Igf2 ICR loci is methylated that prevent binding of insulator protein CTCF and hence allows Igf2 transcription while restricting H19 expression. The reverse is with maternal derived H19/Igf2 ICR loci that is hypomethylated allowing binding of CTCF and inhibiting the Igf2 expression. Loss of imprinting at H19/Igf2 are disrupted in wilm's tumour and other types of cancers. The loss of imprinting results in overexpression of Igf2 from both maternal and paternal alleles. The increased expression of Igf2 can promotes the growth of tumour cell, preventing damaged cell getting destroyed by immune system.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belong to the class of DNA "demethylating" agents. It inhibits the function of DNA methyltransfererase thereby hypomethylating the DNA. The DNA methylation is among the important epigenetic regulatory process that controls the gene expression. Cancer results from the hypermethylation of several genes including tumour suppressor genes that regulates the cell growth and division. When the expression of tumour supressor is blocked by DNA hypermethylation, control over cell division lost and hence prompting cancer. Decitabine, hence through hypomethylating DNA can restores the normal function of tumour suppressor genes. Decitabine also has an antimetabolite  action, taken by rapidly dividing cancer cells causing direct cytotoxic effect and death of tumour cells.  </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The epigenetic alterations are inheritable from one generation to next hence alteration to the epigenetic regulation such as DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome. The are some sensitive period in the development of organism where there is an increasing chance of epigenomic altrations to genome such as during primordial germ cell (PGC) developement. During this sensitive period of developement clearing and resetting of epigenetic signature occurred that are important for normal development of an organism. The treatment of patients at this sensitive period is not advised since treatment at this critical sensitive period may predispose the patients to devastating developmental anomalies.     </div>
