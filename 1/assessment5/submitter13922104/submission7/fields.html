    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value">Normally, DNA hypomethylation occurs at CpG islands, so especially for tumor-suppressor genes, they will be expressed and be able to fight invasion of unwanted tumors and suppress their growth. In cancer, CpG islands which are normally hypomethylated are hypermethylated, but other parts of the gene which are normally methylated are generally hypomethylated in cancer cells. By hypermethylating the CpG islands at the promoters of tumor-suppressing genes, the promoters cannot activate, and the genes will be rendered unable to suppress growth of cancerous tumors and the tumors will be able to metastasize.<br /><div><br />DNA methylation normally occurs in intergenic regions and on repetitive elements, inhibiting the activation of promoters in these regions, so the specific sections of the gene (elements) will not be transcribed randomly and cause unwanted mutations in the genome. In cancer, hypomethylation in intergenic and repetitive element regions will allow repeats to be easily transposed, disrupting neighboring genes, coding gene sites, and most importantly could activate certain oncogenes (cancer-inducing genes), leading to deletions, insertions and translocations in genes, increasing genomic instability, and growth of tumors.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The imprint control region is methylated on the paternal allele, therefore no insulator is recruited, making the enhancers free to activate Igf2 and so Igf2 is expressed. The imprint control region is unmethylated on the maternal allele, leading to the recruitment of CTCF which insulates the control region and the enhancers can only act on H19. The Igf2 will therefore be silent and will not  be expressed.<br /><br />The loss of imprinting causes hypermethylation at the control region on the maternal allele, which leads to Igf2 being expressed not only on the paternal allele, but the maternal as well. The hypermethylation on the maternal allele leads to Igf2 being expressed on both parental alleles, and as Igf2 is growth-promoting, there will be rapid metastasis of the cancerous tumor.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and will be present in all daughter cells once the mother cell is affected/mutated by an outside source, in this case the drugs. It is therefore possible that by altering 1 cell, the future daughter cells from that cell will also be "immune" to the cancer effectors. <br /><br />A sensitive period is a duration of time where epigenetic reprogramming or key development happens. The most notable periods are early development pre-implantation and the development of primordial germ cells of an embryo, so this applies to women during pregnancy. Treating patients during this period could have drastic negative effects as there is little to no DNA methylation at these times for the embryo, and the drugs could alter the genes of the embryo as it develops, and would be able to access those genes that are not normally accessible due to the loosely bound DNA during this period, leading to birth defects and aberrant gene mutations.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. It hypomethylates the DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase, which catalyzes DNA methylation. Then as the cancerous cell divides, the genes (especially tumor-suppressing genes) that were prevented from inhibiting tumor growth will be demethylated, and will be activated and able to suppress the growth of these malignant cells.<br /></div>
