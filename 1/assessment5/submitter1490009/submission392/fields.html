    <h1>Submission 392 from Anon (session_user_id: 62d2f24f83e730dd6541518b1ca1ca50a127f15f)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Among the epigenetic modifiers which are available in the drug market, DNA methyl transferase inhibitor (DNMT inhibitor) and histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) are proven to be efficacious in malignant therapy. Decitabine, belongs to DNMT inhibitor, is a class of drugs that inhibit the activity of
DNA methyltransferases that catalyze the transfer of methyl groups in specific
promoter regions called CpG islands. They are important in the generation of hypomethylated
DNA of tumor suppressor gene. This DNA hypomethylating agent is limited to cytosine analog compounds
that have 5’ ring modification in their structures. Drugs that inhibit DNA
methylation have the ability to be incorporated into the DNA, and then trap
DNMT enzymes that will then be targeted for degradation by the proteasome. 

















The absence of DNMT enzyme during DNA synthesis
results in hypomethylated DNA in the daughter cells and re-expression of
particular silenced genes, that lead to anti-tumor effect.    <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is one of the most well-studied epigenetic
mechanisms, both in normal and cancer cells. DNA methylation is the transfer of
the methyl group into cytosine of the DNA to produce 5-me cytosine. The DNA
methylation particularly occurs at cytosine (C) base followed by guanine (G),
that so called CpG island. The DNA methylation is also symmetrical that is
transferred through cell division. In the normal state, CpG island at the
promoter region of a gene is hypomethylated that allows active gene expression.
Aberrant DNA methylation in cancer occurs when the CpG island at the promoter
is hypermethylated that lead to gene silencing of tumor suppressor genes.
Additionally, there is a global hypomethylation of the epigenome, that resulted
in genomic instability. Together, both mechanisms have been shown to contribute
in tumorigenesis.</p><p>Moreover, DNA methylation also occurs in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is essential to maintain genomic stability. In the normal cells, the intergenic region and repetitive elements are methylated. However, inappropriate methylation of the intergenic regions will produce deletion, reciprocal translocation, or insertion that may induce cancer. While methylation at repetitive elements will promote genomic stability by repeat silencing and mutation (C to T) to prevent transposition, silencing of repeats to avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters and repeat methylation to prevent illegitimate recombination.    </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Human genome contains approximately 150 imprinted genes that exist in clusters and controlled by imprinted control region (ICR). The ICR can be methylated or unmethylated in maternal or paternal alleles. In the H19/Ig2 cluster there is a paternally imprinted allele. The ICR of paternal allele is methylated and spread through the downstream of H19, lead to silencing. Beside, because ICR is methylated, the insulator protein called CTCF can no longer bind, and induce the downstream enhancer to express Igf2. Therefore, Igf2 is expressed from the paternal allele. <br />In the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated and allow CTCF protein to bind. Because of the chromatin looping, the downstream enhancer prefer to induce expression of H19, instead of Igf2. Therefore, Igf2 is not expressed in maternal allele. <br />In the Wilm's tumor, there is up regulation of Igf2 as an oncogene from the paternal allele that lead to growth promotion. It is because maternal allele behave like paternal allele that may be induced by mutation/deletion lead to loss of imprinting      </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetics involves reversible, heritable yet
non-genetic systems that control gene expression and activity. DNA
methylation is an essential epigenetic mechanism that is found in most of human
cancer. Altering the aberrant DNA methylation in cancer using epigenetic
modifier, like DNMT inhibitor may reverse the hypermethylated promoter of tumor
suppressor genes that allow their re-expression. Besides, treatment of patient using DNMT inhibitor is more effective in cells that are rapidly dividing, because it is a nucleoside analogs in which DNMT1 will bind irreversibly and can not pass the epigenetic mark to the daughter cells. Taking consideration is the timing to give this drugs at sensitive period of epigenetic modifications. The sensitive period is the time when the cancer cell in DNA replication stage, thus DNMT inhibitor will inhibit cell division. <br />Additional consideration, younger patient may not be suitable for therapy of DNMT inhibitor because they are at developmental stage, where the cells rapidly divide and the DNA methylation occur. DNMT inhibitor is also not suitable for cancer therapy during primordial germ cell development.       <br />
