    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are DNA regions with a relatively high content of cytosine-guanin bases. They are parts of about 60% of gene promoters and usually unmethylated in health. However, during cancerogenesis CpG islands become progessively methylated. This CpG island hypermethylation in general results in silencing of the genes regulated by those promoters. Consequences of these changes include the supression of tumor suppressor genes, which normally control the cell cycle and contribute to normal cell function and cell growth, resulting in uncontrolled cell growth, acceleration of cell divisions, and reduces cell death rates. Further consequences are turbations in imprinted genes (so-called loss of imprinting) with subsequent cellular overgrowth, which is characteristic for cancer cells, and silencing of tissue-specificity genes leading to loss of the tissue-typical functions. Thus, CpG island hypermethylation can result in changes comparable  to those from DNA mutations.<br />Each type of cancer shows characteristic patterns of DNA hypermethylation, i.e. the genes affected depend on the cancer's DNA methylation profile. However, some cases of DNA hypomethylation in CpG poor promoters are known. This may end in activation of genes that contribute to cancer, e.g. the RAS oncogene.<br /><br />In contrast, DNA methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements decreases during cancerogenesis resulting in hypomethylation. The methylation of these DNA elements in health contributes to genomic 
stability, for instance by inhibiting transposable elements from jumping around in the DNA and thereby disrupting genes or regulatory elements. Consequently, cancer-related hypomethylation of intergenic regions causes genomic instability such as incorrect recombinations between repeats permitted by the open chromatin that results from the hypomethylation. The hypomethylation of repetitive elements leads to  activation of promoters that had been silenced by the DNA methylation (cryptic promoters), and to interruption of genes when transposons jump into the gene sequence (e.g. IAP). <br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In health, the paternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster shows DNA methylation in the promoter region of the H19 gene (so-called imprint control region or ICR) and thus, the H19 gene is silenced. In turn, the CTCF insulator protein cannot bind to its DNA element, which is also methylated; downstream enhancers can act on the Igf2 gene allowing its expression. The maternal allele of the H19/Igf2 locus however appears to be unmethylated in its normal state. This allows for H19 transcription facilitated by the downstream enhancer elements. Additionally, CTCF insulator now can bind to its unmethylated binding region thus blocking Igf2 expression, i.e. Igf2 is silenced from the maternal allele.<br />In Wilm's tumor an overexpression of Igf2 is observed. The underlying reason is a hypermethylation of the ICR of the H19/Igf2 cluster. This hypermethylation makes the maternal allele act like the paternal allele in such a way that now the ICRs at both alleles are methylated and thus Igf2 is expressed from both alleles (i.e. Igf2 overexpression). As Igf2 is a growth factor the loss of imprinting described above contributes to tumour growth. Because many imprinting genes are growth promoting genes, their overexpression can contribute to cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi). It inhibits the DNA methyltransferase enzymes by irreversibly binding to them after it has been incorporated into the DNA during replication (it is a nucleoside analogue). Thus, decitabine prevents the laying down of new methylation marks on the DNA and eventually results in DNA demethylation. This drug appears to be most effective against cancers of the blood such as the myelodysplastic syndrome, because this type of cancer shows hypermethylation in tumour suppressor genes with subsequent silencing of these. Removing the hypermethylation might regain the tumor suppressor activity, but actually the mode of action of this drug is unknow yet. The anti-neoplastic effect of decitabine and other DNMTi emerges only in relatively low doses , whereas higher doses are toxic and non-specific.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is passed to the daughter cells during cell division, i.e. DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. Thus, the effect of drugs that affect DNA methylation not only persists during the period of treatment, but the curative change in DNA methylation is passed on to the subsequent cell generations.<br />In sensitive periods, use of epigenetic drugs might cause larger adverse effects. In these periods, DNA methylation is almost completely removed and afterwards re-established. During development these periods occur in the early preimplantation time and during the development of the primordial germ cells. Though probably quite unlikely, epigenetic drugs should not be taken, if the patient wants to become pregnant. Of much greater relevance seems to be the time of growth and development in children, where many cell divisions take place and pass on their DNA methylation patterns. Since the replication-dependent DNMTi are applied systemically and their specificity for cancer cells is not clear, these drugs could also have undesired effects on healthy cells. Thus, drugs acting on DNA methylation should not be taken by patients still in growth and development.<br /></div>
