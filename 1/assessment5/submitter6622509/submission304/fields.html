    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">To understand changes in DNA methylation in cancer we must first understand role of DNA methylation in the normal cell at CpG islands and at intergenic and repetitive regions. The role of methylation-demethylation at the CpG islands is to sustain the tumor suppressor genes by remaining unmethylated.  This is dramatically illustrated by what occurs n cancer.  Methylation of the CpG islands and the island shores, a primary characteristic of cancer cells, leads to inactivation of the tumor suppressor genes, promoting the development of cancer cells. <br />The function of methylation at the intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to maintain genome wide stability.  Loss of intergenic and repetitive region methylation results in genome wide instability with increase in transcriptional noise, reduced inhibition of antisense transcription  and reduced direction of RNA splicing. These changes contribute to cancer. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor utilized in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia. It is a nucleoside analogue.  It was formerly used in large doses as a cancer treatment and was found to not only be ineffective in treating cancer but had numerous, intolerable side effects.  However, more recently it has been used in much smaller doses with excellent results.  The smaller doses are sufficient to allow binding to DNMT after its inclusion in DNA. It disrupts the methylation of DNA elements, allowing the tumor suppressor genes to function normally.  Its effects depend on cell replication which is, of course, a primary characteristic of cancer cells. Thus it is more disruptive to cancer cells than to normal cells.  These effects are utilized in the treatment of hematological cancer. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The effect of epigenetic drugs in altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because of the possibility of mitotic inheritance of the altered DNA methylation to subsequent generations of cells. Cancer cells replicate more rapidly than other cells and therefore may be differentially more susceptible to these agents.<br />A sensitive period is a time during which epigenetic marks are being actively laid down.  The two major sensitive periods in mammalian development are primordial germ cell formation in the genome and during early embryogenesis, specifically during blastocyst formation. <br />Treating patients with epigenetically altering drugs would be inadvisable during sensitive periods because of the lasting and widespread effects of altering the epigenetic marks when there are few cells because these cells are the progenitors of many generations of cells to come.  Because sensitive periods are times of more active laying down of epigenetic marks, it is a time when this process is specially susceptible to disruptive change. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The methylation pattern of the paternal allele is one in which the control region. lgf2 is not insulated by CTCF and is expressed.Due to methylation spreading, H19 is not expressed. <br />The methylation pattern of the maternal allele is unmethylation of the control region with insulation of lgf2 by an insulator protein,CTCF. As a result, the lgf2 region is silenced.  Due to chromatin jumping H19 is enhanced instead.  H19 is a long non-coding RNA which serves as a reservoir of a micro RNA.<br />In Wilms tumor the lgf2 is doubly expressed due to mutation or to duplication of the paternal allele or to epigenetic disruption.  lgf2 is an oncogene, a growth promotor.  In association with disturbance of Kcnq1, also with growth promotion, the effect may be instigation of Wilms tumor, a childhood kidney cancer. <br />The disrupted imprinting at the H19/lgf2 cluster contributes to cancer by excess growth promotion, unmodified by the usual expression of growth limiting elements of the maternal allele. </div>
