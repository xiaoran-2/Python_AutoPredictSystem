    <h1>Submission 63 from Anon (session_user_id: 601c581e7519b076f61a3b23f860da542a57cf3f)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that alter DNA methylation, such as Decitabine can have a enduring  effect on the epigenome. The mechanism of mitotic heritability ensures the epigenetic information is copied to daughter cells. <br />When using medications such as Decitabine the sensitive periods of development have to be born in mind. A sensitive period occurs,when the cell nucleus can be easily modified, such as during early development of the embryo and germ cell development.<br />During these periods epigenetic reprogramming takes place. Epigenetic drugs may interfere with this process and must be avoided during these periods. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Methylation is achieved by bonding methyl groups (CH3) to the DNA  In the normal cell nuclei CpG islands are hypomethylated . This results in methylation of repetitive elements and intergenic regions as well as introns. <br />In cancer cells CpG islands are hypermethylated. This results in lack of methylation of repetitive elements, intergenic regions and introns, producing an increase in gene expression<br />Disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands allows expression of genes that should be silenced. For example an onco-gene may be expressed , where it should be silenced. This may result in rapid cell multiplication and thus cancer. As well lack of suppression of repetitive elements can interfere with the integrity of the dna structure. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Insulator mediated imprinting at the H19/Igf2r locus is parent specific. <br />The methylation pattern of the paternal allele exhibits strong suppression at the ICR region. This prevents CTCF binding. With methylation at the H19 promoter the enhancers can access Igf2. This results in Ifg2 expression. In the maternal allele the ICR remains unmethylated. allowing CTFC and its cofactors to bind thus forming an Insulator. This prevents Igf2 expression and therefore the H19 gene is expressed. <br />When paternal imprinting at the H19 /Igf2 cluster is disrupted, levels of H19 reduce significantly. This may lead to the development of Wilms' tumour. This is a tumour of the kidneys, that occurs in very young children. <br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">A new range of cancer drugs to act upon the epigenome is emerging. Several drugs have been approved by the FDA, whereas additional types are in the development/evaluation stages. <br />Decitabine belongs to the class of DNMTi's (DNA demethylating agents).<br /> This drug is used to treat cancer through its effect upon the epigenome via demethylation of CpG islands.<br />DNMT inhibitors are nucleoside analogues and will therefore irreversibly bind DMNT's after integration into DNA theory reducing methylation. <br />Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect by targeting enzymatic epigenetic regulators. (I wish to thank Dr Marnie Blewitt for outlining these concepts in her video lecture on Epigenetic Drugs. )<br /><br /><b></b></div>
