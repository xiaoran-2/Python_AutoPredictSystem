    <div class="field-value"><p><span>CpG islands are regions rich in CpG dinucleotides often found within promoter regions of many genes
and usually they are unmethylated, which means that they are transcriptionally active. In normal cells
methylation at CpG islands is usually associated with gene silencing.<br />
In cancer this pattern is disrupted and CpG islands are often hypermethylated, especially at the
promoters of tumor suppressor genes, which are thus effectively silenced. This epigenetic silencing can
be one of the two hits in the Knudson hypotheses leading to cancer and each specific tumor type
displays a diagnostic set of heavily methylated tumor suppressor genes. Another important feature of </span>cancer epigenomics is the increased methylation observed at CpG island shores, approximately 2 Kb in
the neighborhood of CpG islands, and this methylation is a good prognostic factor of reduced gene
expression.</p><div><div><div><div><div><div><p><span>
In normal cells we can observe DNA methylation in intergenic regions, repetitive elements and even
introns; this methylation prevents recombinatorial events during mitosis, thus contributing to genomic
stability. A typical feature of tumor cells is instead a genome-wide hypomethylation and this lack of
protective methylation at repeats and in intergenic regions poses a serious challenge to chromosomal
stability due to illegitimate recombinations between the repeats, activation of repeats and of cryptic
promoters, which can thus disrupt the normal regulation of nearby genes.
</span></p>
								<p><span>This hypomethylation is a driving force in tumorigenesis because it increases chromosomal instability
which is one of the hallmarks of cancer since leads to an aberrant pattern of gene expression. </span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>
			<p>The expression of the H19/Igf2 cluster is regulated in a parent-of-origin specific manner: we can see
that in normal cells the paternal allele is methylated at the Imprint Control Region so the insulator
protein CTCF will not be able to bind to it, allowing enhancers to bind to Igf2 instead, thus promoting its
expression.
</p>
			<p><span>In the maternal allele instead the ICR is not methylated and so the CTCF will bind to it allowing the
enhancers to act on H19, which will be expressed whereas Igf2 will remain silent. So in normal cells Igf2
is expressed only from the paternal allele and H19 is expressed only from the maternal allele.</span></p><p><span><br />
In Wilm's tumor this imprinting pattern is disrupted and we notice a hypermethylation of the ICR on the
maternal allele; this way the CTCF will not bind to it and the maternal allele will behave like the paternal
one and this will lead to an increase in Igf2 expression. So in cancer cells there is an excess of
expression of Igf2, which is a growth factor and this leads to an increase in cellular growth. </span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>
			<p><span>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNMT inhibitors: its role is to suppress the activity of the enzymes
that methylate DNA.<br />
Decitabine works in a replication dependent manner and so it particularly effective in cells which are
growing and dividing rapidly, such as tumor cell. These cells need to replicate their DNA and decitabine,
a nucleoside, is incorporated into the growing DNA strand which is currently replicated. Once the
enzyme responsible for methylating this new DNA strand binds to decitabine it remains blocked to it
and its action is thus effectively inhibited. This way decitabine blocks the methylation of the new daughter
strands of DNA and so the original methylation is passively diluted and decreased.
</span></p>
			<p><span>Presumably this inhibition of DNMT activity reduces the hypermethylation at CpG islands, also on those
located on the promoters of tumor suppressor genes, which cane expressed again, slowing tumor
growth. </span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation is a very stable epigenetic mark and it is faithfully passed to daughter cells after
mitosis because of the action of a specific enzyme, Dnmt1, which acts to restore the normal methylation
pattern on hemi-methylated DNA strands after replication. Altering DNA methylation can change the
normal pattern of epigenetic marks and can potentially lead to serious modifications in gene
transcriptional activities.</span></p><p><span>
Sensitive periods are those developmental periods which see the clearing and then re-setting of
epigenetic marks: there are two main sensitive periods which are of crucial importance. The first period
starts after fertilization when there is an active de-methylation of the paternal genome through the action
of TET proteins and a passive demethylation of the maternal genome; then epigenetic marks are set
again.<br />
The second relevant sensitive period is during Primordial Germ Cells development, when there must be
a different setting of epigenetic marks depending on the sex of the organism; another sensitive period is
the so-called slow prepubertal growth period.<br />
The use of drugs which alter epigenetic state should be avoided during such sensitive periods, because </span>there is the potential of transgenerational effects due to disruptions of this resetting of marks on the
gametes. </p></div>
