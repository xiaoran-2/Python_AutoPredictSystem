    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation does not normally occur at CpG islands, thus genes are open to transcription factors and can be active. In cancer cells, the CpG islands become hypermethylated resulting in the silencing of the near by genes. DNA methylation at CpG islands can disrupt the expression of tissue specific genes or imprinted gene which often involves genes associated with cell growth. DNA methylation can also silence tumor suppressor genes, causing cells to proliferate in a uncontrolled manner. This promotes cancer. </p>
<p>In a normal cell, DNA is normally methylated at the intergenic regions and repetitive elements,  In cancer cells, there is a lost of DNA methylation at the intergenic regions and repetitive elements, this can cause genomic instability. Genomic instability occurs due to recombination that can happen between these repeats that are no longer in the heterochromatin state. The activation of these repeats can also cause them to transpose to other places disrupting other genes. Lost of DNA methylation at intergenic regions can  also activate cryptic promoters and disruption the expression of neighbouring genes. </p><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>At the paternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster the Imprint Control Region (ICR) is methylated at the CpG, thus the downstream H19 gene is silenced. However, this allows the enhancer elements to act on Igf2 and activates it. On the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated, thus the downstream H19 gene is active. The unmethylated ICR allows a CTCF insulator protein to bind preventing the enhancer elements downstream of H19 on activating Igf2. Therefore Igf2 is inactivated in the maternal allele. In Wilm's tumour, both ICR on the maternal and paternal allele are methylated, thus both allele of Igf2 is activated, resulting in a an overexpression of Igf2. Igf2 is a insulin like growth factor that is required during fetal growth and the development of many tissues such as the brain. Therefore lost of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster resulting in increase production of Igf2 can stimulate uncontrolled cell growth promoting cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to a class of drugs known as DNA demethylating agents. It works by demethylating or interfering with the methylation of DNA. In cancer cells, due to the hypermethylation at CpG islands, tumor suppressor genes can be silenced causing uncontrolled proliferation of cells, thus promoting cancer. By demethylating at the CpG islands, it is hoped that the normal function of these tumor suppressor genes can be restored, thus cell growth is controlled. Decitabine can also cause cell death of these rapidly dividing cancer cells due to the toxic effect it produces when cells incorporate Decitabine in it's normal cellular metabolism. This also helps in removing cancer cells that have escape the normal cell growth control. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is heritable through cell division, thus when DNA methylation is altered by drugs, the methylation can be pass on and maintained. Sensitive period for epigenetic are periods where the genome is cleared of epigenetic marks and reprogrammed. These sensitive periods occur during early development and primordial germ cell development. Treating patients when they are pregnant would be inadvisable, as this may affect the unborn and it's subsequent generations. During these periods DNA methylation is cleared and reprogrammed and it is not recommended to use drugs that may alter DNA methylation. This is because at this period altering DNA methylation can effect gene expression, genomic stability and genomic imprinting. This can lead to disastrous effect for the offspring.  </div>
