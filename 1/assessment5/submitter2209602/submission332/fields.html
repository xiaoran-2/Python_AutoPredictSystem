    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normal functioning of DNA methylation at CpG islands are that they are unmethylated but in cancer they are methylated which silenced important genes which needs to be expressed or some suppression grow wildly.   Methylation at the wrong places makes the gene act wrong mistakes which makes things that were supposed to expressed not expressed and maybe suppressed things that supposed to be silenced. DNA methylation in integenic region and repetitive element helps thing that would be cancerous or dangerous not be expressed in cancer they are unmethylated and are expressed and cause cancer to grow instead of acting normally silenced.  In cancer the genes act in opposite in which is normal the CpG Islands are methylated the integenic regions and repetitive elements are unmethylated and it causes a mess.  <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The imprinting genes are inherited from both parents but one expressed on one allele.  Methylated ICR bring about imprinted gene expression It is methylated on mother gene it maternal alleles imprinted locust H19/Igf2 enhancer blocker.  if it is methylated on father it is paternal allele have shared Igf2 enhancers.   Disrupting imprinting at H19/Ig2  make the process go wrong make H19 promoter to silence and enhancer can assess Igf2 to activate which it not what the body wants or need causes cancer.  It causes cancer because it makes a mistake and causes growth where there should not be.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to demethylating drugs.  Decitabine makes DNA reverse methylation and stops the cancer since methylation in wrong areas causes cancer and demethylation the wrong areas of methylation stops cancer from growing.  It helps myelodysplastic syndrome.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">It changes the epigenome and can have affect on next generation.  The senstive period is  cell division to daughter or granddaughter cell until erase.  Sensitive period is when you can erase and change cell. Early development.  It is inadvisable because it changes everything in every cell and you might need it one does not know what every epigenetic marks does so it is dangerous.<br /></div>
