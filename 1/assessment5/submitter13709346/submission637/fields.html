    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cells, the CpG islands are found demethylated, but these ones can be methylated when there is a silencing of the gene expression. In cancer cells, the CpG islands are methylated, therefore there is a gene expression silencing. This mutation contributes to cancer because some tumour suppressor genes are silenced. These methylation of the CpG island can also happen in sets of genes and affect the expression of these ones. <br /><br />The intergenic regions and repetitive elements are found methylated in the normal cells because it's part of the maintenance of the genomic integrity and stability. In cancer cells, these intergenc regions and repetitive elements are demethylated; this mutation provokes an instability in the genome causing transpositions of the repeats, activation of cryptic promoters and illegitimate recombination between repeats. Also can result in the activation of some genes that can cause the inhibiton of tumour suppressor genes.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the paternal allele, the imprinted region of the H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated affecting and silencing the H19 promoter, therefore the enhancers act on Igf2 and promote its expression. In the case of the maternal allele, the imprinted region is bound to the CTFC, wich is an insulator protein; these insulates Igf2 from the downstream enhancers, so the enhancers act on H19 and promote its expression. <br /><br />In Wilm's tumour, the imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is affected because the maternal allele doesn't have the protein CTFC and the imprintig region is methylated, so it acts like the paternal allele. These contributes to cancer because there is a proliferation of Igf2, wich is an oncogene.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine can be used to treat cancer because it is consider a DNA-demethylating agent due to the fact that inhibates the DNMTs or the DNA methyltransferases, therefore this drugs affects the methylation of the DNA and promotes the DNA demethylating. These can have an anti-tumour effect because it can reverse the hypermethylation of the tumuor suppressor genes.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering the DNA methylation can have enduring effects because it is mitotically heritable, so this could be the reason why some patients, who received the epigenetic drugs, had good response to the chemotherapy. <br /><br />The sensitive periods are when the epigenome can be altered due to enviromental substances or conditions; these sensitive periods are in the early development of the embryo before implantation and whent the germ cells are developing in the fetus. Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisble because it can alter the developing in germ cells and show bad effects in the epigenome.<br /></div>
