    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is altered in cancer in the following ways.<br />CpG islands that are usually unmethylated are found to be not only methylated, but hypermethylated in a lot of different types of cancer as these are usually located in tumour suppressor genes. This can result in the expression of intergenic regions, and other repetitive elements which would normally be silenced, this is due to normally methylated regions that are found are now hypomethylated. In normal scenarios, unmethylated CpG islands upstream of genes can indicate silencing of the above as methylation of CpG dinucleotides can be found near regions near where the islands and shores are located. This ensures that regulation is maintained and expression does not take place. The importance of ensuring that these regions are silenced is to maintain the integrity of the genome and to maintain genomic stability. When DNA methylation of the CpG Islands takes place, regions that are usually silenced are now being expressed, this means that cell proliferation may occur at an uncontrolled rate (tumourogenesis) if another hit has taken place elsewhere in the genome, i.e. the activation of an oncogene. Another important fact to remember is that DNA hypermethylation of CpG Islands is an epimutation that is mitotically heritable and can quickly spread with each cell division (even though this type of mutation is reversible).</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the example of H19/Igf2 cluster the interplay of the genes works in accordance to which parental allele they are being expressed from. On the paternal allele the imprint control region (ICR) is methylated. This prevents the binding factor CTCF from activating H19 and the enhancers located downstream act on the Igf2 gene to promote growth. Conversely on the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated, the binding factor CTCF is able to act on this and activates H19. The enhancers act on this gene and prevents the activation and expression of Igf2 located upstream of the ICR and H19. In the case of Wilm's tumour, methylation is disrupted, leading the maternal allele to act in the same way as the paternal allele by methylating the ICR. This leads to over-expression of the Igf2 gene which leads to rapid and uncontrolled growth (tumourogenesis). </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a epigenetic drug that acts as a DNA-demethylating agent. Decibatine works by working on myelodysplastic syndromes by working on the enzyme that is over-expressed in laying methyl groups, and therefore silencing expression of genes and/or nearby genes that act as tumour suppressors. By doing so, the additional methyl groups are removed. Methyl groups are epigenetic marks that are mitotically heritable, therefore the removal of these marks are carried onto daughter cells and later cells with each cell division. This will lead to the halting of the further growth of the tumour.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The use of epigenetic drugs may have longer lasting effects on a patient than anticipated. By altering the DNA methylation of the epigenome, this can be maintained for many generations of cell division due to its mitotic heritability. Depending on what the drug has targetted, this could affect of other regions of the epigenome that where not intended to be targetted, either by silencing activity (hypermethylation) or by creating open channels for replication where there shouldn't be. This is very important when considering sensitive periods where certain stages of development are vulnerable to epigenetic changes and could therefore change its landscape. Examples of sensitive periods of development include the primordial germ cells (PGCs), and gametogenosis, and embryonic development; this are found primarily in children and young adults. Certain treatments geared towards altering the epigenetic machinery need to be given additional consideration before administering to this group of patients as this can have adverse effects on future generations and we cannot be certain how far reaching they could be.</div>
