    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normally you don't have DNA methylation at CpG islands to have activated tumour suppressor genes.<br />In cancer some CpG islands may have an increasing methylation - which causes silence of tumour suppressor genes, allowing the cells to divide more rapidly and not die as much.<br />The intergenic regions and repetitive elements are in general <span>methylated to maintain genomic stability.<br /></span>In cancer the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated - which causes genomic instability, including illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition; and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes. These instabilities have consequences like reciprocal translocations between two different chromossomes, and chromossomes deletions and insertions.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The imprint control regions (ICRs) should display monoallelic parent-of-origin-specific expression, but in some cases of cancer, ICRs can be hypo or hypermethylated and genes become expressed from both parental alleles or silent from both parental alleles, and lots of genes that are imprinted are involved in growth either as growth promoting or suppressing.<br />For example, in the H19/Igf2 cluster the ICR is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele, so it is paternally imprinted.<br />On the unmethylated maternal allele CTCF binds (this insulator element) (the ICR) so the enhancer acts on H19 and Igf2 will be silent.<br />On the methylated paternal allele the CTCF does not bind so the enhancer can act on Igf2 and Igf2 is expressed.<br />In Wilm’s tumour a loss of imprinting causes hypermethylation of the ICR on the maternal allele, so you have expression of Igf2 by it, causing a double dose.<br />As Igf2 is growth promoting it is associated with this type of cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The drug Decitabine belongs to the class of epigenetic inhibitors called DNA-demethylating agents. This drug acts by depleting the DNA methylation. In tumours driven by tumour suppressor hypermethylation in the CpG islands, the depletion suppress tumorigenesis.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable, in other words, they <span>are passed on during cell division to descendants cells.<br />A sensitive period is when the environment may be able to influence epigenetic makeup, because they </span>are of active remodelling of the epigenome and when the epigenetic marks are being established.<span><br />One </span>sensitive periods of development is the period of primordial germ cell development until the production of mature eggs and sperms; and the other sensitive period is the pre-implantation and early post-implantation periods.<br />Treating patients during theses sensitive periods would be inadvisable because these drugs that alter DNA methylation has the potential to affect every cell of the system, so can have unexpected side effects.<br /></div>
