    <div class="field-value"><p><b>Normal:</b></p>

<p>DNA methylation<span> <span>is a process by which </span></span><span>methyl
groups <span>are added to DNA. Methylation modifies the function of
the DNA, typically acting to suppress gene </span></span>transcription<span>. DNA methylation is essential for normal development and
is associated with a number of key processes including </span>genomic imprinting<span>, </span>X-chromosome
inactivation, suppression of repetitive elements,
and carcinogenesis.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Cancer:</p><p>Typically, there is hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes and hypomethylation of oncogenes.<br /></p>

<p><span>DNA methylation may affect the
transcription of genes in two ways. First, the methylation of DNA itself may
physically impede the binding of transcriptional
proteins to the gene, and second,
and likely more important, methylated DNA may be bound by proteins known as methyl-CpG-binding domain proteins (MBDs). MBD proteins
then recruit additional proteins to the locus, such as histone deacetylases and other chromatin remodeling proteins that can modify histones, thereby forming compact,
inactive chromatin, termed heterochromatin. This link between DNA methylation
and chromatin structure is very important.</span></p><p>Intergenic:</p>

<p>1) repetitive portion of the genome is heavily methylated while most CpG islands
remain unmethylated in normal cells, </p><p> 2) that cancer cells exhibit
widespread loss of intergenic DNA methylation with gain of methylation at many
gene-associated CpG islands, </p><p> For example, within the DNA
“methylome” of individual tumors approximately 1−10% of CpG islands are
aberrantly hypermethylated . Contrary to previous notions, one study found that
nearly 5% of gene-associated CpG islands are methylated in normal peripheral
blood leukocytes (PBLs) and that a fraction of these normally methylated CpG
islands become<strong> hypomethylated and transcriptionally active</strong> in cancer cells Genome-wide
studies also revealed that promoter-associated CpG islands are not the only
islands affected by aberrant DNA methylation. Some CpG islands located within
the 3’ ends of genes and in intergenic regions exhibit hypermethylation in
cancer cells.</p><b></b></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">A.)<br />CTCF insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. DNA methylation at ICR blocks binding of CTCF binding. Without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence and enhancers can access Igf2 to activate .The ICR at IGF2 and H19 is normally methylated on the paternal allele. Methylation is excluded from the maternal allele by CTCF binding. The presence of CTCF confers an insulator function upon the ICR, which blocks access of the IGF2 promoters to the enhancers downstream of the H19 gene.<br />B.) In paternal allele,Enhancers help express igf-2 as ICR is methylated and CTCF can't bind. In maternal allele, no methylation at ICR, CTCF binds ICR and blocks transcription.<br />C.) Disruption of imprinting caused by deletion of the <i>H19</i> gene region in Wilm's tumor<br />D.)The imprinted <i>H19</i> gene, which encodes an untranslated RNA, lies at the end of a cluster of imprinted genes in the mouse. Imprinting of the insulin-2 and insulin-like growth factor 2 genes, can be disrupted by maternal inheritance of a targeted deletion of the <i>H19</i> gene and its flanking sequence.Paternal inheritance of the disruption has no effect, which presumably reflects the normally silent state of the paternal gene.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">A. Hypomethylating agent<br />B. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase.<br />C. Hypomethylating agents block the activity of DNA methyltransferase (DNA methyltransferase inhibitors / DNMT inhibitors). so Tumor suppressor genes start working normally again/.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">A. Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.<br />B. Sensitive periods are time periods where administering an epigenetic drug will be harmful rather than beneficial to a person. <br />C. prenatal and early-life development<br />D. Risk for developing certain mental disorder and psychiatric  disorders.</div>
