    <div class="field-value"><b>DNA methylation at CGIs: </b><br />In normal cells the CpG islands (CGIs) are in general hypomethylated in both expressed and silent genes. Some CGI promoters do become hypermethylated during development e.g. some imprinted genes and at tissue-specific CGIs at some developmentally important genes. This lead to gene silencing.<br />In cancer cells there is a gain of DNA methylation at CGIs (CGI hypermethylation) occuring frequently at tumour suppressor genes resulting in transcriptional silencing of these tumour suppressor genes.<br />The Increasing CGI hypermethylation at tumour suppressor genes is associated with progression from hyperplasia, through neoplasia to invasive tumours as exemplified in retinoblastomas or BRAC1 positive tumours. Another example is the hypermethylation of imprinted control regions (ICRs) which may result in over expression of growth promoting genes or loss of expression of growth restricting genes. E.g. Hypermethylation of the imprinted control region of IGF2 leading to overexpression of IGF2 resulting in the childhood tumour, Wilm's tumour.<br /><b>DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements:</b><br />In normal tissue DNA methylation at intergenic regions is thought to maintain genomic stability and suppress cryptic transcription start sites or splice sites. Intergenic regions are usually methylated in normal tissue. Likewise repetitive elements are usually methylated to prevent transcriptional interference and prevent illegitimate recombination e.g. cut and paste of genetic material, duplikations or transpositions. As such they can be viewed in light of the Genome Defense model.<br />In cancer these regions show a tendency to become hypomethylated making the genome more prone to duplikations, transpositions etc. as well as risk of activation of cryptic start and splice sites with disruption to neighboring genes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>The <em>paternally</em>-expressed IGF2 gene and <em>maternally</em>-expressed H19 gene share enhancers. Their reciprocal imprinting is controlled by a CTCF-dependent insulator located</div><div>between the genes and it acts as an enhancer blocker.</div>The <em>paternal </em>allele is hypermethylated at the Imprinted Control Region (ICR) preventing binding of CTCF and in addition there is hypermethylation at the promoter of the H19 gene. In result H19 is <b>not </b>accessible to the enhancers. Instead IGF2 is now accessible to the enhancers and IGF2 is transcribed.<br />On the <em>maternal </em>allele the ICR is hypomethylated making binding of the insulator CTCF possible so the downstream enhancers only act on the H19 gene (which now has an unmethylated promoter) leading to transcription of this gene (H19) and prevents the enhancers are not acting on the IGF2 gene leading to repression of the IGF2 gene.<br />In <em>Wilm's tumor</em> the maternal allele is also hypermethylated at the ICR leading to expression of IGF2 from both the maternal and paternal allele. IGF2 is growth promoting which may contribute to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a  DNA-de-methylating agent or in other words a DNA methylation inhibitor used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome. It is a nuceloside analogue which, irreversibly bind DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA and hence depend on replication. In small dosages it is anti-neoplastic though toxic in large dosages. Since it is not specifically targeting tumors it, as many anti-tumor drugs, exploit the fact that neoplasms are rapidly dividing and as such more sensitive to this toxic replication dependent effect. Therefore the rapid dividing neoplasms will loose DNA-methylation also at the hypermethylated tumor suppressor genes on which the malignancies are depending.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA-methylation (5-methyl-cytosine) almost exclusively occur at CG di-nucleotides and hence are symmetrical and is mitotically inheritable. In the dividing cell the one hemi-methylated strand act as a substrate for DNMT1 which methylates the new "sister" strand and the DNA mehtylation pattern is hence maintained. The hypomethylation broad on by the DNMT-inhibitors like decitabine, will be passed on to future "generation" of the dividing neoplastic cell in the same way. Hence it may by less tolerable to the standard chemotherapy even beyond the period of drug treatment. This mitotic <span>inheritability </span>should also be taken into account when considering if persons are eligible for this kind of treatment. Treatment during the sensitive periods where epigenetic reprogramming occur e.g. in germ cells and during early development is especially sensible to these drugs. One could be worried about treating young individuals since the effect on the germ cells has to be taken into account especially in females as the oocytes are in maintained in a haploid de-methylated state until puberty. These DNMT-inhibitor drugs may disrupt the epigenetic re-programming and lead to failures in gene expression with impact on phenotype due to the altered epigenetic control.</div>
