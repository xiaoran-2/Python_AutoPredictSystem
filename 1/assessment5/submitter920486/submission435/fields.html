    <div class="field-value">The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to silence genes, so they're not able to produce the protein they encode. In cancer, it can occur that the CpG islands are hypermethylated, that is, with more methylation than the normal cells, and then silencing of tumor supressor genes can occur. It can also occur that de CpG islands are hypomethylated, that is, with less methylation than the normal cells. In this later case, some oncogenes that are normally silent, can be expressed.<br /><br />DNA methylation in intergenic regions is thought to be present to maintain genomic stability, that is, to avoid deletions, insertions or translocation of genes in the chromosome. This methylation can also silence cryptic promoters and cryptic splice sites, to avoid that two genes that have some exons in common try to express themselves at the same time, resulting in incomplete protein transcription.<br /><br />In cancer, there is a hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements. This lead to a more open chromatin, so it is easier to have genomic inestability, because this regions are more accessible, and the repeats even can make copies of themselves to be inserted in the chromosome and is easier to have aberrant transcription. All these "mistakes" in the transcription of the chromosome can lead to cancer cells. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Methylation of imprint control regions are not related to silencing of genes, but rather indicate whether it is maternal or paternal imprinted. The H19/igf2 cluster, normally is unmethylated in the maternal allele and methylated on the paternal allele, and that means that is paternally imprinted. This cluster produces a long noncoding RNA called H19, only from the maternal chromosome (because it is silenced in the paternal chromosome). This H19 represses the production of igf2 from the maternal allele, which is not expressed. In turn, methylation of the paternal allele implies no production of H19, and therefore, production of igf2, only from the paternal allele.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumour, the maternal allele is also methylated, which causes that both the maternal and paternal allele produce igf2. The elevated quantity of igf2, with no supressor H19, acts as a growth promotor factor of the tumour.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a drug that acts as a DNA-demethylating agent, that is, it removes the methylation of the CpG islands and other parts of the chromosome. Due to its effect on the methylation of CpG islands, it can activate again the genes that function as tumour supressors.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">A drug that alters DNA methylation can be effective even after the treatment is finished because the epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable, that is, they are transmitted when the cell divides by mitosis.<br /><br />Sensitive periods, in terms of epigenetics, are germ cell developement and early embryonic development. In these periods is when epigenetic reprogramming occurs, and therefore, when environmental factors are more likely to have an influence in the epigenetic marks.<br /><br />During those periods, treating patients with drugs that affect epigenetic machinery would be inadvisable, because it would interfere with the imprinted control regions, which in turn could cause expression of both the paternal and maternal allele, or silencing of both, leading to abnormal development of the offspring. <br /></div>
