    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>DNA methylation at CpG islands usually leads to the silencing of the corresponding gene.<br /></li><li>There is usually locus-specific hypermethylation of CpG islands in cancer cells.</li><li>Hypermethylation of CpG islands occurs frequently on the tumour suppressor genes which leads to the uncontrolled division of the cancer cells.</li><li>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements are responsible for silencing of these repeats and transposons to ensure the genomic stability. </li><li>There is often hypomethylation of the intergenic regions and repetitive elements in cancer cells.</li><li>Hypomethylation of the intergenic regions and repetitive elements in cancer cells causes the translocation of the repeats and transposons to other regions of the chromosome, leading to either insertion, deletion or amplification of genes, thus disrupting the genomic stability of cells.</li></ul> <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>The imprint control region is normally methylated in the paternal allele, inhibiting the binding of CTCF to the insulator element and hence, Igf2 is expressed. </li><li>The imprint control region in the maternal allele is unmethylated, thus allowing CTCF to bind to the insulator element and simultaneously allowing enhancer to act on H19, leading to the suppression of the expression of Igf2.</li><li>In Wilm's tumour, the imprint control region of the maternal allele is methylated as well as the paternal allele. </li><li>The methylation of both the imprint control regions of maternal and paternal alleles leads to the inhibition of CTCF from accessing the insulator element, and thus overexpression of Igf2 in cells. Since Igf2 is growth-promoting, this event leads to the aberrant growth of the cells and consequently the growth of cancer. <br /></li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Decitabine belongs to DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. </li><li>Decitabine leads to hypomethylation of the cells by incorporating itself as a nucleoside analogue into the DNA and inhibit the action of the DNMT enzyme by causing the enzyme to be bound irreversibly to the DNA strand. </li><li>Decitabine inhibits the laying down of methylation marks on the daughter strand of the DNA which indirectly halts the replication and division of the cells, contributing to the suppression of the cancer growth. </li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable, in which the changes made by altering DNA methylation can be passed on the daughter cells during cell division. </li><li>A sensitive period is when epigenetic marks are erased in the somatic cells so that lineage-specific epigenetic marks can be laid down accordingly later in development.</li><li>The sensitive periods of development include embryo preimplantation development and primordial germ cell development. </li><li>If epigenetic drug is used during sensitive periods, it will disrupt the epigenetic machinery responsible for the shaping of different cell fates during development and it has long-lasting effects since it affects primordial germ cell development. </li></ul></div>
