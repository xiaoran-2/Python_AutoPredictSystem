    <div class="field-value"><div><p><span>The methylation at CpG islands is a mechanism that
is related with gene silencing, and it is important in cell differentiation
(differential gene expression). This methylation is a strong epigenetic marker,
because it is mitotically inherited; and commonly the CpG islands are
unmethylated. In cancer there is a hyper methylation in CPG islands especially,
in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes, and this is an event that has been
found in all tumors. The silent of these tumor suppressor genes is an important
hit in cancer developing; because it can cause that cells divide faster and
inhibit apoptosis, which contributes to tumor progression and worse outcomes.
Besides the hypermethylation of CpG islands is a progressive process that
increase with the development of cancer and it is a different in the different
subtypes of tumors.<br /><br /></span></p>

<p><span>On the other hand in normal cells there is a high
methylation in intergenic regions in order to prevent genomic instability by,
deletion, insertions, duplication and translocation, besides it is associate
with the silence of cryptic start sites or cryptic splice sites. Also there are
high methylation of repetitive elements to prevent transposition, interference
from strong promoters and illegitimate recombination. In cancer there is a early
and progressive hypomethylation of these intergenic regions and repetitive
elements which leads to increase genomic instability, this cause structural
chromosomal alterations (loss, gain and rearrangement of chromosomes) and
increase in the mutations rate. This genomic instability is a normal feature of
cancer cells.</span></p></div><p></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The H19/Igf2 cluster is controlled by a enhancer blocking (a insulate protein call CTCF) and it is paternally imprinted, it means that the DNA methylation is in the paternal chromosome. In the paternal allele the imprint control region of this cluster is methylated preventing that CTCF bind and it cause that the enhancer acts is the Igf2 gene and increase the expression of it; whereas methylation spreads and inhibits the expression of H19 (a long not coding RNA). In the maternal allele the imprint control region is unmethylated and CTCF can bind to it; this makes that Igf2 be silenced  because the enhancer acts in Hq9 gen.<br /><br />In Wilms tumour there is a hypermethylation of the H19/Igf2 cluster , it cause that both the parental and maternal allele be methylation in the imprint control region and that CTCF can not bind to any; So, in this tumor both alles express Igf2,that it is a growth promoting. the overexpression of Igf2 promotes the overgrowth associated to Wilms tumour, that its expeciali worrying in in newborns and childrens. besides loss in control of imprint region is a early step in cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor that is are used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. this drug acts as a nucleoside analogue attaching DNMTs to the DNA irreversibly when the cell division is going on; making that DNMTs cannot copy the methylation mark to the daugther strand. This cause a reduction on hypermethylation of CpG islands that is important in this disease. Because cancer cells have increased cell replication; these are most affected by Decitabine than normal cells and has been shown that low doses the drug is well tolerated, works well and has few side effects</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The epigenetic markers can be kept for long periods of
time, because may be inherited mitotically and DNA methylation is a
particularly stable mark .in the treating of patients with drugs that affect
the epigenome is important to consider the sensitive periods of development;
they are periods when there is an epigenetic reprogramming and in which there
is a high susceptibility to environmental changes. this sensitive periods are:
early development and the development of primordial germ cells (PGC) ; in these
periods many genetic markers are cleared and reset, like the parental, maternal
and imprinted genes (in PGC) and others need to be maintained, like the
repetitive elements, For this reason interfere in the normal process of
epigenetic in this periods of time can lead to great disorders. for example is
not advisable use this drugs in pregnant woman's or in young people; who are
still developing PGCs</span></p></div>
