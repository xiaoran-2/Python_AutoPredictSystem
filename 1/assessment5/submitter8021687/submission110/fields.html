    <div class="field-value"><br /><p>A high frequency of CpG dinucleotides are considered an island and are usually
found in the promoter region. Individual CpG dinucleotides are dynamically methylated
between cell types to suppress expression of an inactive gene and constitute
far less of the genome due to the mutagenic properties of methylcytosine. However, they can be found in the CpG
dinucleotide context as part of CpG islands which are about 1000 bp long. At least 70% of  transcriptional promoters are CpG islands that can have
enhancer elements.  They are usually unmethylated. The
normal function of methylation at a CpG island is to silence or downregulate a
gene and is maintained through mitotic division via DNMT. If the underlying
gene was a tumor suppressor then tumorogenesis is encouraged. And is also
associated with a repressive chromatin structure. Through gene targeting,  two methyltransferases  that are laid down de novo (DNMT3a and
DNMT3b)  can be blocked in early embryos
and cause demethylation. Also, modification of 5 mC to 5hmc by TET protein family functions to promote gene expression during active demethylation.  Impairment of
these systems gives rise to mutations and directly contributes to
tumorigenesis.  As a promotor a CpG island is usually kept
unmethylated to maintain a transcriptional permissive state.  Downstream,  75% of the genome is made up of intergenic or
repetitive elements.  When the CpG island
located upstream is methylated the intergenic and repetitive elements becomes
hypomethylated which encourages carcinogenesis due to genomic instability
because of illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats
and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to
neighboring genes.  Therefore,
methylation of the intergenic and repetitive elements is disrupted through the
methylation of a CpG island.  Methylation
of  intergenic and repetitive elements assures stability of the genome by
transcriptional downregulation to prevent transcription from happening through
a nonspecific basis due to random RNA polymerase activity. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><br />Decitabine is a small molecule DNMT inhibitor. DNMT is an enzyme that is responsible for de novo and maintenance of methylation of tumor suppressor genes.  Decitabine forms covalent bonds as a nucleoside analog to DNMT and is therefore incorporated into DNA upon replication. It is therefore replication dependent.  When DNMT comes to bind the nucleotide to copy methylation to the daughter cell, DNMT is bound irreversibly and cannot be released.  This is considered a passive form of demethylation.  Because cancer cells replicate more often they are more highly affected.  Decitabine is therefore a nucleoside metabolic inhibitor/antimetabolite directing cytotoxic effect on a dividing cancer cells because of the covalent binding with DNMT.  Decitabine's propensity for DNMT makes it somewhat inefficient for 
specific genes vs. gene promoter DNA demethylation. Therefore it is more
 effective on a genome wide basis.   Decitabine 
therefore functions through epigenetic alterations and apoptosis 
induction.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The  specific cluster h19/lgf2 uses the insulator model of imprinting: enhancer blocking. Both the maternal and paternal allele will have enhancers.  lgf2 is silent on the maternal allele.  The activity of the lgf2 gene depends on which parent it was inherited from.  Normally, it is inherited paternally. When the ICR on the paternal allele is methylated it blocks binding of the CTCF.  Without CTCF, methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence it and lgf2 is paternally imprinted.  On the maternal allele, the lgf2 in inactive which means there is no methylation on the ICR which ensures that H19, acting as another gene for growth and development, becomes active.  This is normal genetic function.  In Wilm's tumor, activation of the silent maternal lgf2 leads to biallelic expression of lgf2 and other feasible maternal translocations. Wilm's tumor is therefore genetically heterogeneous and feasibly multigenic in origin.  This is loss of imprinting accompanied with epigenetic modification of H19.  The increase of lgf2 function can lead to the growth of tumor cells and the inability to destroy damaged cells.  Disrupted imprinting on this cluster leads to unstable genetic function particularly as it relates to cell proliferation. It is also suspected that H19 functions as a tumor suppressor.   <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Sensitive periods of the genome include primordial germ cell to gametes and preimplantation to early postimplantation. They are times of active remodeling of the epigenome with the addition and removal of epigenetic marks.  This limited period to reestablish appropriate marks in soma and germ lines are critical when developmental outcomes may be affected by exogenous epigenetic mechanisms. Epigenetic changes are preserved when cells divide. Most epigenetic 
changes only occur within the course of one individual organism's 
lifetime, but if gene inactivation occurs in a sperm or egg cell that 
results in fertilization, then some epigenetic changes can be 
transferred to the next generation.  Consider that  epigenetic alterations in cancer cells affect virtually all cellular 
pathways it can be construed that the same would be true of exogenous alterations through drugs.   These alterations are 
able to affect the expression of genes involved
 in cell cycle control, apoptosis, cell signaling, tumor cell invasion 
and metastasis, angiogenesis and immune recognition.  As such, they can be considered critical players in normal cell growth and proliferation. Therefore the use of drugs during the sensitive period could be construed as deliterious in later life.  Best use would be during the somatic maintenance period and even then the use of epigenetic therapy should be specified to a genotype. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
