    <div class="field-value">The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to silence gene expression. In a normal cell CpG islands are hypomethylated, but in cancer cells CpG islands are hypermethylated. This can lead to silence tumour supressors genes expression, then the cells can divide more rapidly and develop a tumour.<br />The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to maintain the genome stability, as these are silenced. In a normal cell intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated, but in cancer cells both are hypomethylated. This can produce genome instability because of the deletions, reciprocal translocations and insertions in the chromosomes.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell at the H19/Igf2 cluster we see methylation of the paternal allele at the ICR, but there's no methylation for the maternal allele. The CTCF complex binds to the maternal allele at the ICR, then the downstream enhancers can act on H19. But the CTCF complex can't bind to the paternal allele at the ICR, because ICR has been methylated, so the enhancers can't act on H19, instead they drive the expression of Igf2. In a normal cell we observe a normal dose of both H19 from maternal strand, and Igf2 from paternal strand. The problem is when the ICR becomes hypermethylated, then the maternal strand behaves like paternal strand. So now both strands express double dose of Igf2 (and no dose of H19) which is a growth-promoting. That's what will cause Wilm's tumour.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent or DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi). This drug is a nucleoside analogue, so it gets incorporated into the DNA upon replication. The inhibitor binds irreversibly to DNMT1, just when DNMT1 comes to bind this nucleoside in order to copy the methylation to the other strand. In consequence, Decitabine causes DNA demethylation (DNA hypomethylation).<br />As we can observe this drug is division-dependent. This means that cancer cells, which are dividing more rapidly than normal cells, will be more severely affected because they are replicating more.<br />This drug is being used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. The anti-tumour effect of Decitabine has been linked to reactivation of epigenetically silenced tumour supressor genes, induced by the hypomethylation.<br />It's important to know that DNMTi have to be used in low doses, because in high doses they can be toxic.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is an attractive form of regulation to target in treatments, because it can be manipulated once, and enduring effects are ensured because epigenetic marks (as DNA methylation) are mitotically heritable. However, there are some periods, called sensitive periods ("A period of development that is susceptible to environmental signals"), where we ought to avoid treating patients with this kind of drugs. These are critical periods of time where extensive epigenetic reprogramming occurs, which are during early embryonic development (pre-implantation development), and during primordial germ cell (PGC) development. In consequence, pregnant mothers (including a few months before conception), and childs in development (especially during PGC development), shouldn't be treated with this drugs.</div>
