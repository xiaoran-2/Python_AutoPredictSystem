    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are areas in the genome with a large amount of G and C nucleotides; they are often found at transcription start sites <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3480634/" title="Link: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3480634/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3480634/</a> ). CpG islands are often hypermethylated in cancer (ibid.). Hypermethylation usually corresponds to epigenetic silencing (for example silencing of tumor suppressor genes would promote tumorigenesis). Intragenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated which corresponds to transriptional silencing (ibid.). In cancer these regions are often hypomethylated which leads to genomic instability secondary to recombination events.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a de-methylating agent (<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" title="Link: http://www.economist.com/node/21552168">http://www.economist.com/node/21552168</a>) . It removes methyl groups presumably counteracting the effect of hypermethylation of CpG islands at transcription start sites. It could have an anti-tumor effect by removing the inhibition of of tumor suppressor sites and restoring normal function.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because epigenetic effects are mitoticly heritable. Treatment with any epigenetically active drug would have to be avoided during sensitive periods (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3480634/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3480634/</a> ). These are periods of epigenetic reprogramming such as the period following embryo implantation and X inactivation, gametogenesis, and cell differentiation (ibid.). Treatment with an epigenetically active agent during a sensitive period would disrupt the normal process of removing and laying down epigenetic marks.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprinting is the expression of only one of two parental alleles (<a href="http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/IGF2">http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/IGF2</a> ). There are two possible imprinting disorders: neither allele is expressed or both alleles are expressed.The maternal allele is normally non-methylated which allows the binding of a transcription factor (CTFC) that physically blocks the IGF2 promoter(ibid.). The paternal allele is normally methylated which prevents the binding of a transcription factor (CTFC) and allows the expression of IGF2(ibid.). Wilm's tumor results from a mutation anywhere in the H19/IGF2 cluster which prevents the binding of CFTC on the maternal allele and thus increased expression of IGF2(ibid.). Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) has numerous growth-promoting effects but functions as an oncogene when epigenetic regulation is disrupted.</div>
