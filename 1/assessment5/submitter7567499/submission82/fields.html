    <div class="field-value">Normally, CpG islands are usually not methylated, while the gene itself, repetitive elements and intergenic regions are. Over time in developing cancer there occurs a genome-wide hypomethylation at the same time as a locus-specific hypermethylation. The results are basically the opposite of normal: methylated CpG islands and unmethylated genes, repeats and intergenic regions.<br /><br />At CpG islands, methylation normally predicts whether or not a gene is expressed. Hypermethylation/metylation results in genes not being expressed (gene silencing). When this happens to tumour suppressor genes, the result can be cancer. This silencing is mitoticially heritable, which means it is passed on to daughter cells during cell division.<br /><br />DNA methylation at repetitive elements and intergenic regions normally contribute to maintainin stability in the genome. This occurs by making sure the normal number of chromosomes is kept (no gains or losses of chromosomes), and also that no wrong recombinations between chromosomes take place when they should not.<br /><br />As mentioned, with cancer comes genome-wide hypomethylation and the very methylation that kept the genome stable is now lost. The result is as mentioned above: deletions of chromosomes, insertions and unwanted recombinations.<br /><br />In normal cells, repetitive elements are densely packed together as heterochromatin and is therefore not available for e.g. recombination. In cancer, repetitive elements come in the euchromatin form and the elements can therefore align themselves and perform recombinations.<br /><br />Hypomethylation activates repetitive elements, allowing them to duplicate and move around the genome and also transpose. They can insert themselves into the coding region of other genes (preventing correct reading of said gene) and also activate neighbouring genes.<br /><br />So, disruption of methylation in repetitive elements and intergenic regions contribute to cancer via genome-wide hypomethylation (and therefore the potential activation of genes that are normally silenced) and tumor suppressor hypermethylation (i.e. inactivation of suppressor genes leading to uncontrolled growth).<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer cells have lost their imprinting. This means that where you
would normally only express one copy of a certain gene, either the paternal or
maternal allele, in cancer cells you express both or neither. The reason this results in tumour growth is that many imprinted genes are involved in growth control. </p>

<p>Imprint control regions can be both hyper- or hypomethylated in cancer.
This depends on the function of the region. In the case of H19/Igf2 cluster
hypermethylation takes place.</p><p>In the paternal allele, the imprint control region is normally methylated, so there is no CTCF attaching to it. This allows the enhancers to reach Igf2 and activate it. H19 is also methylated and therefore silenced.</p><p>On the maternal allele, the imprint control region is normally unmethylated. This means that CTCF can bind to this region. In turn, enhancers will activate H19, keeping Igf2 silent.</p><p>Imprinting is lost in Wilm's tumour and you get hypermetylation of the imprint control region on both alleles. Igf2 is expressed from both alleles and you get twice as much Igf2 as a normal cell. Since Igf2 is a growth promoter, cells with double the amount of this will result in a fast-growing tumour.<br /></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. It decreases DNA methylation, allowing genes that have been switched off due to metylation caused by cancer to be switched on and become active again.<br /><br />Together with histone-deacetylase inhibitors, azacitidine (decitabine sold under a different namee by a different pharmaceutical company) has been shown to slow tumour growth in some patients with advanced lung cancer.<br /><br />This shows that drugs that affect epigenetic processes can be used on solid tumours, which are harder to treat because the drugs have to work their way through them.<br /><br />Some of the patients later also became more receptive to regular chemotherapy treatment, which might mean that the epigenetic drugs altered the tumour cells in some way, making them more suseptible to this kind of treatment.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Because DNA methylation in cells is mitotically heritable it is passed on from the mother cells to all the future generations of daugher cells. During so-called sensitive periods is DNA methylation reset.<br /><br />Sensitive periods are certain stages of development where epigenetic marks are reset and the epigenome is particularly susceptible to changes and disturbances, outside and otherwise. Examples of this include <em>in vitro</em> fertilization, <em>in vitro </em>culture of cells, embryo handling, intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and germ cell harvest.<br /><br />The sensitive periods of development are: (1) early development from gametes via fertilized egg to blastocyst, and (2) primordial germ cell (PGC) and germ cell (GC) development. During these periods DNA methylation of the genome is removed.<br /><br />Treating patients with any kind of drug that makes changes to the epigenome during sensitive periods is not recommended. This is because this treatment could then seriously disrupt the epigenetic reprogramming that is about to take place in the cells. The result could be genomic instability and mutations which in turn could <em>lead to</em> cancer (as opposed to treating it). Another result could be imprinting defects to the genome resulting in various diseases and syndromes such as Beckwith Wiedemann, Prader-Willi and Angelman syndrome.<br /></div>
