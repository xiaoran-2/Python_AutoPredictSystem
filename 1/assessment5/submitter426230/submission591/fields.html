    <h1>Submission 591 from Anon (session_user_id: 2b81d1b9d192a0c90f0caffcf717979286cee252)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Explain why treating patients during sensitive
periods would be inadvisable. Since epigenetic changes are mitotically
heritable through the cell cycle, a change in the epigenetic patterns of the
cell may lead to greater effects in long-term. Epigenetic markers are reduced
in two phases: Early Development Phase and Primordial Germ Cells. These periods
are thought to be the most sensitive periods of the cell to the epigenetic
changes especially the ones influenced by environmental factors. Therefore, periods
of life such as especial times in pregnancy may be critical to changes of epigenome
in either the fetus or his or her germ cells. </p>

<p><span>Cancer cells are thought to have rolled back
to their pleuripotency characteristics and many epigenetic markers are erased
in the cells leading to unlimited proliferation of the cells. By marking back
the epigenetic markers there can be a stop block in the altered cell
proliferation so that cancerous cells are stopped but not killed and save their
function.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent made
by a Japanese company which is used to treat Myelodysplastic syndromes and
Acute Myelogenous Leukemia. Decitabine results in cell hypomethylation by
inhibiting DNA methyltransferase and causes cell death in the S phase of the
cell cycle.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal mammalian cell, CpG islands are found to have less
methyl content, regardless of their gene expression. On the contrary, in
cancer, CpG sites are found to be hypermethylated leading to silencing of the
gene expression. These genes are usually involved in limiting cell cycle and DNA
repair. Altered expression of these genes in cancer leads to uncontrolled tissue proliferation. </p>

<p><span>On the other hand, intergenic regions play
their role in the regulation of gene expression as small or long non-coding
RNAs. These RNAs have different effects on their surrounding genes (sense or
antisense). They also tend to be involved in shaping the chromatin structure.
In cancer, altered lnRNA expressions result in changes in chromatin complex
assembly, suppression of tumor suppressor genes and overexpression of antisense
regions. It is also suggested that non-coding RNAs can have more regulatory
effects by interacting to miRNAs.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>H19/Igf2 cluster is an Imprint Control Region
in human chromosome 11, which is thought to be involved in Beckwith-Weidman
Syndrome. CTCF is a protein which binds to a part of ICR complex and  insulates the Igf2 from the other parts of the
cluster leading to enhancements in the expression of h19 on the maternal allele.
</span></p>

<p>In Paternal allele the ICR is methylated so
that CTCF is not bound to the region. Therefore, enhancers can reach to igf2
and the expression of h19 is diminished. The result is overexpression of Igf2
which is a growth factor and can lead to Wilm’s tumor in the Kidney of the
affected children.</p>

<span>If maternal allele is
methylated and act like paternal allelle it leads to overexpression of Igf2
leading to Tumor-like cell growth in different tissues such as pancreatitis and
tongue. This is a sample of altered cell growth in which the extra growth
factors lead to extra tissue proliferation leading to cancerogenous growth of
the tissues.</span></div>
