    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are weakly methylated in a normal cell, and
therefore the cells are  able to express
the proteins related to those genes. DNA methylation at the CPG islands at the
promoter of a gene has the potential of inhibiting its expression. This is
especially important for tumour suppressor genes. </p>

<p>However, in cancer, DNA methylation at the CpG islands of
tumour suppressor genes increase substantially, leading to a decreased
expression of that gene. </p>

<p>This fact contributes to cancer: the tumour suppressor genes
are silenced, then the protein that is able to stop the development of the
tumours is not expressed, therefore the cancer develops. This happens in many types
of cancer, such as RB in retinoblastoma and BRCA1 in breast cancer.</p>

<p>Regarding intergenic regions and repetitive elements, the
normal function of DNA methylation in these areas is a high grade of
methylation, the opposite that what happened with the CpG islands. </p>

<p>In cancer, these intergenic regions and repetitive elements
are hypomethylated, meaning that their methylation state is much lower. This
decrease leads to genomic instability.</p>

<p>The genomic instability caused by the hypomethylation at
these regions contributes to cancer by the illegitimate recombination between
repeats, activation of repeats and transposition or activation of cryptic
promoters. There is evidence for this fact in both mouse models and human
cancers.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The methylation of the ICR of the H19 promoter in the paternal
allele disables the binding of CTCF to this region, therefore the enhancers
cannot act on H19 and they act on Igf2 instead, and Igf2 is expressed from the
paternal allele.</p>

<p>The unmethylated state of the ICR of the H19 promoter in the
maternal allele enables the binding of CTCF to this region, therefore the
enhancers can act on H19 and they cannot act on Igf2, and therefore Igf2 is not
expressed from the maternal allele.</p>

<p>In Wilm’s tumour, the imprinted control regions of the
maternal allele are also hypermethylated, disabling the binding of CTCF to this
region so the enhancers cannot act on H19 and they act on Igf2, generating a
tumour.</p>

<p>As Igf2 gene is also expressed from the paternal allele, the
disruption of the imprinting at the maternal ICR and the consequent expression
of the maternal Igf2 gene generates a double dose of Igf2 expression. The
excessive amount of this growth factor induces tumour generation and therefore cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, and it is one of
the known DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi).</p>

<p>Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue that binds irreversibly
to the DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA. Its binding inhibits the
activity of the DNMTs, and as the DNMTs cannot insert the methyl groups as they
are occupied by the inhibitor, DNA methylation decreases when the cell replicates.
</p>

<p>Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect, for example, in
all the cancers caused by hypermethylation of the CpG islands; when decitabine
is given to an affected patient, it has the potential to remove the methyl
marks from the CpG islands, therefore returning the methylation state to the
one of a normal cell, and the tumour suppressor genes could be expressed again,
stopping the spread of the tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
genome because these epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to
daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Therefore,
epigenetic therapies can perform changes able to stop a cancer growing without
having to kill all its cells, but caution is needed as they might alter “healthy”
methylation states irreversibly, leading to disease.</p>

<p>Sensitive periods are periods during the development of an
organism when the environment may be able to influence its epigenetic makeup,
being periods when the genome is actively remodelled, both for removal and
addition of epigenetic marks. In contrast, during the somatic maintenance period
(most of the time in the human lives), human bodies are less sensitive to the
environment.</p>

<p>Examples of sensitive periods of development are the period
from the primordial germ cell development to the production of gametes, and
also the implantation and early post-implantation period (early embryonic development).</p>

<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods would be
inadvisable because during these periods a high level of reprogramming takes
place, and the addition of epigenetic drugs could have devastating effects, for
example, in the early stages of pregnancy, altering the normal development of
the embryo.</p></div>
