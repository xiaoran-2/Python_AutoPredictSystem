    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA
methylation is the modification of Cytosine base into 5-methylcytosine by addition of methyl group in CpG dinucleotides in mammalian somatic cells and
non CpG sequences of Embryonic stem cells. Methylation results in repression in
gene activity and plays a vital role in imprinting, X chromosome inactivation
and the formation of heterochromatin (Hassler &amp; Egger, 2012). Promoter
regions of genes (tumor suppressor genes) are rich in CpG islands and are
usually not methylated (hypomethylation) independent of the activity state, but
in cancer cells these regions are hypermethylated thereby silences the effects
of the gens. This is a frequent mechanism in comparison to mutations and Identity
of these varies on the tumor type. Silencing a tumor suppressor genes and affecting
other hallmarks of cancer causes
cell transformation (Hanahan &amp; Weinberg, 2011). These
mutations are reversible, opening the pathway to therapeutically remove them as
a treatment for cancer.</p><p><span>DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually hyper
methylated and as a result generally reduces transcriptional noise from
alternative start sites, inhibit antisense transcription or direct RNA splicing
and relates to replication timing (Hassler &amp; Egger, 2012)</span>. In the case
of cancer these regions tend to be hypomethylated so the regions are
considerably loosely packed causing many genomic instabilities such as
illegitimate recombination, activation of repeats and transposition, activation
of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes leading to
transcriptional aberrations such as deletions, insertions and reciprocal
translocations. Increase in genomic instability in such ways causes cancer (Blewitt, 2015).</p><p>Reference:</p><p><span>Hassler, M.R.

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Unlimited growth proliferation is a hallmark of cancer. Most genes that are imprinted are involved in growth, disruption of these genes can cause cancer by over expression or silencing the gene from parental allele. </p><p>H19/Igf2
cluster is found on human chromosome 11 and controlled by enhancer blocking.  CTCF - imprinted control region (ICR) is unmethylated on maternal allele and methylated on
paternal allele.  CTCF insulator protein on maternal allele insulate Igf2 from downstream enhancers and ultimately enhances (by chromosome looping) H19 (long noncoding RNA) expression as CTCF blocks the enhancers from acting on Igf2 (preferred loop). Hence H19 is produced just from the maternal allele. On paternal allele CTCF is
methylated and can no longer bind and cause insulator action allowing the
enhancer to bind to Igf2, hence igf2 express only from paternal allele
and not from maternal allele. H19 is silenced on paternal allele due to DNA
methylation spreading/ heterochromatin spread from ICR into the H19 promoter.  </p>

<p>Loss of
imprinting Igf2/H19 cluster happens due hypermethylation of ICR on maternal allele
allowing the expression of Igf2 on maternal allele as well resulting on double
dose of Igf2. Igf2 is growth promoting and associated with childhood kidney
tumor, Wilm’s tumor Blewitt, 2015).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine
is a drug targeting enzymatic epigenetic regulator, DNA methyl transferase
inhibitor (DMNTi) and its approved by FDA.  Decitabine is a neucleoside analogue that get incoperated into DNA upon replication and irreversibly bind to DNMT.  As cancer cells divide more rapidly, when applied in low dosage DNA demethlyation happen actively and this kills tumor cells. DNA demethlation (only know mechanism of action) of Decitabine is very effective in myelodysplastic syndrome progressed to acute myeloid lymphoma
(AML), which is a hematopoietic malignancy. The high activity on these tumors might be due to heavy CpG island hypermethylation.  Decitabine specificity to cancer cells is uncertain. Decitabine is shown to increase life expentancey of cancer patients after administering indicating that it has a strong anti-tumor effect (Blewitt, 2015).</p><p>Reference;</p><p>Blewitt, M., 2015. <i>Epigenetic Control of Gene Expression</i>.

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering
DNA methylation has an enduring effect on the epigenome beyond the period of
treatment of drugs because epigenetic changes are passed on during cell
division generation to generation until the epigenetic marks are actively
erased (The Economist, 2012).</p><p>Sensitive
periods are when environment can influence epigenetic make up. During development, two major periods of epigenetic reprogramming are most sensitive to changes
in environment; period of pre-implantation and early post implantation
and the period between primordial germ cells development to producing gametes where
active remodeling of epigenome happens. Even the changes to the diet during
these critical times can have an effect.  Apart from these two major sensitive periods,
in adults there are brief windows of time that particular organ can be having a
very sensitive period due to the way it develops.</p>

<p>Changes
in epigenetic make up due to drugs, during sensitive periods are inadvisable
because they not only affect cancer cells but every cell in body. For example younger patient undergoing germ cell development, this can be a
major environment change that can cause extreme changes in epigenome that
could be harmful for the future (Blewitt, 2015).</p><p>Reference;<br /></p><p>
