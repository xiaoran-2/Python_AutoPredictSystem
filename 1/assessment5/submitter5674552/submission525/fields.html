    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is thought to contribute to establishment of
specific gene silencing by methylation of CpG islands which are found in about
60% of promoters. DNA methylation seems to have a leading role in epigenetic
gene silencing as it can promote silencing in multiple ways. For example, DNA
methylation at CpG islands can recruit methylated-CpG-binding proteins that can
act as adaptors for binding of other epigenetic factors involved in chromatin
condensation that is strongly associated with gene silencing. Nevertheless, in
normal cells, CpG islands are often mainly kept unmethylated independent of
their activity state. In fact, DNA methylation is more often found at
repetitive elements, or generally in intergenic regions that make most of
eukaryotic genomes. The presence of DNA methylation in these sites is very
important as it prevents transposition or illegitimate recombination of
repetitive elements, thereby maintaining genome integrity. Moreover, methylation keeps cryptic promoters inactive, which can otherwise be
deleterious to the cell.</p>

<p><span>The methylome of cancer cells is mainly altered as compared to
the methylome of normal cells. Firstly, in many tumor cell lines DNA
methylation at promoter CpG islands is found in an usual high frequency. A
common way by which locus specific-CpG island hypermethylation can contribute
to cancer is by silencing of tumor suppressor genes as a faster alternative to
genetic mutations. On the other hand, genome-wide hypomethylation of repetitive
elements (or intergenic regions) can cause activation of repetive elements,
thereby leading to genome instability, which is common feature of cancer. Furthermore,
hypomethylation of particular CpG islands can lead to oncogene activation. To
conclude the role DNA hypermethlyation or hypomethation is always context
depended (e.g. tumor type or stage specific) . For instance, if tumorgenesis is driven
by hypermethylation (i.e. silencing) of tumor suppressor genes, then depletion
of methylation would probably lead to suppression of tumorgenesis.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alterations in DNA methylation at imprinted gene regions can result in loss of expression of growth restrictive imprinted genes (i.e.
tumor suppressor genes) or over-expression of growth promoting imprinted genes
(i.e. oncogenes) which can contribute to tumorgenesis. For instance,
hypermethylation of imprinted control region(ICR) in the H19/Igf2 cluster leads to overexpression of
Igf2, which behaves as an oncogene.</p><p>In normal cells, an insulator protein, CTCF, is bound at the ICR
of maternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster. Binding of CTCF at the ICR prevents
activation of Igf2 gene by downstream enhancers, which in this case can only act on the H19
gene.  The paternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster is
methylated at the ICR and H19 promoter, thereby preventing CTCF binding and H19
expression, and consequently allow up-regulation of Igf2 gene, which can now be accessed
by downstream enhancers. In Wilm’s tumour the ICR and H19 promoter of the maternal
allele of the cluster are found to be unusually hypermethylated and
consequently both alleles of the Igf2 gene are being expressed (i.e. loss of
imprinting). As the product of the Igf2 gene promotes growth, over-rexpression
of Igf2 can contribute to uncontrolled cell growth and division which is essential in tumorgenesis. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a small molecule
inhibitor of the epigenetic regulator DNA methyltransferase 1 (belongs to the
DNMTi family). Decitabine acts as DNA demethylating agent by binding
irreversibly on DNMTs when they are incorporated into DNA. Thus, the action of
of the inhibitor is replication depended. Consequently, rapidly dividing cells,
such as tumor cells, would be more severely affected with their methylome being
diluted faster than other dividing cells. The impact of Decitabine on
DNA methylation is genome-wide as DNMT1 is involved in the establishment and
regulation of tissue-specific patterns of DNA methylation. </p>

<p>Although its not selective for cancer cells, low dose of Decitabine can have an anti-neoplastic
effect that is thought to be due altering of DNA methylation patterns.  Its effects are dependent on tumor type.  It particularly performs well in treatment of Myelodisplastic
syndrome progressed to AML which seems to be mainly driven by hypermethylation
of tumour suppressor genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA demethylating agents and standard chemotherapeutics may have
synergetic effects that can be partly due to the ability of the particular epigenetic
drugs to alter the mitotically heritable tissue-specific methylation patterns. Resetting
the epigenome of tumour cells may alter the expression of genes underlying the phenotypic hallmarks of cancer, thereby making them more vulnerable to standard
chemotherapeutics.</p>

<p><span>As most epigenetic drugs are currently not selective to cancer cells,
when administrated there is high risk of affecting other cells or tissues of
the body, especially those that actively undergo epigenetic reprogramming, such
as developing primordial germ cells, and pre-implantation embryos found in the
uterous of pregnant women. Exposure of these cells or tissues to DNA
demethylating agents during epigenetic reprogramming may possibly disrupt resetting of epigenetic marks (including DNA methylation). Disruption
of epigenetic reprogramming during sensitive periods of development (i.e. early embryo development and primordial germ cell development that involve resetting of epigenetic marks at the organismal level) apparently may
be detrimental for the health of a young patient, the patient’s offspring or even
of later generations.</span></p></div>
