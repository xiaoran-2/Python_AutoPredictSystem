    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are found in about 60% of gene promoters and normally CpG islands are mostly unmethylated thus letting genes to be expressed. In cancer CpG islands (and shores) tend to become hypermethylated, so some genes are not expressed properly and  tumor suppressor genes are among those genes. DNA methylation is mytotically heritable, so CpG islands hypermethylation is an alternative to genetic mutation that disrupt tumor suppressor genes function.<br />Normally methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to genome stability. Furthermore DNA methylation of intergenic regions silences cryptic transcription promoter or cryptic splice sites to prevent transcriptional intereference when two RNA moving in different directions meet with each other. When repetitive elements are hypomethylated they start copying and transposing itself and it leads to further genetic mosaicism in cancer and thus more hits. Intergenic intervals hypomethylation leads to abnormal karyotypes and abnormal cryptic transcription regulation.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Igf2 is a growth promoting gene, an oncogene. Downstream from Igf2 there are expression enhancers. Between the Igf2 and the enhancers there is an imprinting control region which serves as a binding site for CTCF protein. If CTCF binds to that ICR it then serves as an insulator - it prevents enhancers from enhancing Igf2 expression. CTCF binds to that site only when it is unmethylated which normally happens only on a maternal allele. On a maternal allele enhancers promote expression of H19 long non-coding RNA which is downstream from CTCF binding site. On paternal allele the CTCF binding site is methylated, CTCF does no bind to it and so enhancers reach Igf2 and enhance its expression. Moreover H19 promoter region is also methylated so it is not expressed.<br />If mutation occure or epigenetic disruption takes place (e.g. CTCF binding site becomes methylated on maternal allele) both alleles start behaving as paternal. Subsequently the expression of growth oncogene Igf2 doubles which contributes to Wilm's tumor tumorigenesis</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine acts as hypomethylating agent which inhibits DNA methyltransferaze. DNA methyltransferaze is an enzyme which is crucial for DNA methylation mitotic heritability - it copies methylation pattern from parental strand to newly formed one after the cell divides. In cancer cells if we inhibit DNA methyltransferaze we will prevent copying of cell's abnormal DNA methylation pattern to newly formed cells and so newly formed cells will not carry epigenetic marks associated with cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Drugs that alter DNA methylation have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable - normally every daughter cell will get same DNA methylation profile as a parental. But I would suggest avoiding these drugs during sensitive periods, which are when epigenetic marks are predominantly erased and then reestablished - during early development (from fertilization to epiblast stages) and during primordial germ cell development. The reason is that the treatment could be ineffective (if dna methylation then is erased during reprogramming), could disrupt methylation marks reestablishment and furthermore could effect dna methylation pattern of offsprings</div>
