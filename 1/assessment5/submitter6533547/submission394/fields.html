    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is a process implicated in the regulation of the gene expression, this mechanism controlates wich gene gonna be silenced on a specific type of cell and have the characteristic of be mitotically hereditable. The way of how it works involves the transferation of a Methyl group by an enzime called Dmnt1 on the specific regions of the DNA called CpG island and eventually silenced that region of the DNA, this process is key to avoid abnormalities on the cell and subsecuent on the tissue.<br />When a cancer arise on a cell this process have shown to be implicated, because on a normal cell the CpG islands are normally methylated and by the other hand on a cancer cell not, also exists another regions on the Genome implicated, the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements this regions are normally methylated on a normal cell, but in cancer cell not, all of this can contribute to the development of the subsequent phases of the cancer, because the Methylation is a way of control of how genes will be expressed and how genes will not, in a cell without the aproppiates hallmarks there aint no control and this can lead a cancer, activating the oncogenes and innactivating the tummor supressor genes due to the lack of these hallmarks implicated on the epigenomic control in conjuntion with the genomic expression.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a recently developed drug which belong to the category of DMNT inhibitors it is also a drug authorized by FDA for its use in therapy. This kind of drug with the others ones who belong to its category acts like the DMNT enzime which is the responsable for add the methyl group on the CpG island , this drug therefore inhibit the action of this enzime and stops the transferation of the methyl group, therefore this can have an anti-tumour effect because inhibiting the action of the DMNT the cancer cell wil not be able to continue her division.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">When a drug is utilized to a specific cancer cell, acts on a specific manner, in the case of the DNMT inhibitors this attaches to the site of union for the methyl group and this inhibit the action of the DMNT, this union can last forever and this can cause a permanent silencing of this locus in the epigenome. Nevertheless, the use of this drugs can have side effects and that's why the period for use of this drugs its critical, this is because the DNA methylation is a control system of the gene expression when we use these drugs in a periods of early development like childhood we can get permanent silencing of a gene and this can lead to abnormalities and aberrant side effects in those individuals, aging its another case of these when we can lead a early deterioritation of the system of the individuals in a long term period, thats why these drugs must be used carefully on the individuals and with the dosis apropiate.</div>
