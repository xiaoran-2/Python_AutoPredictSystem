    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normally, CpG islands are hypomethylated whilst the rest of the genome (including repetitive elements, intergenic regions, and the introns of genes) is more likely to be methylated, In cancer, however, this reverses, with CpG islands becoming prone to hypermethylation, whilst demethylation occurs elsewhere in the genome. This hypermethylation of CpG islands can contribute to cancer when occurring in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes. This leads to silencing of the genes responsible for suppressing tumor growth. These epimutations are mitotically heritable and may be rapidly selected, and contribute towards multiple "hits" on a cell that may result in cancer. <br />Normally, in a healthy cell, genes are generally methylated outside the CpG islands. This results in genes being silenced and unexpressed. During the onset of cancer, DNA becomes hypomethylated in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. This occurs early, and it occurs widely. This hypomethylation results in the activation of oncogenes and expression of harmful repetitive elements, leading to deletions, insertions and the development of tumours. <br />In summary, the pattern of methylation in a cancer cell is generally the reverse of a healthy cell. Genes that are supposed to be expressed, such as tumor suppressor genes, become silenced at the promoter, and those which are meant to be silenced get expressed. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Igf2 is paternally imprinted. In the paternal allele, the imprint control region (ICR) is methylated, and the insulator protein CTCF can no longer bind. DNA methylation then spreads out to the H19 promoter. This results in the silencing of the H19 promoter. Once the H19 promoter is silenced, the enhancer, downstream of the H19 promoter, can access Igf2, and thus activate it. In the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated, and the role of H19 as a long non-coding RNA is unrelated to epigenetic marking. CTCF binds to the ICR, and Igf2 remains inactive. <br />In Wilms tumours, Igf2 experiences a loss of imprinting, or LOI. This means that it is not imprinted from the paternal allele. Methylation normally spreads outwards from the ICR resulting in silencing of H19 in the paternal allele. As H19 has a role in tumour suppression, when imprinting within this region is disrupted, it can no longer fulfill its correct function.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The epigenetic cancer drug Decitabine belongs to the class of enzymatic epigenetic regulators known as DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi). Decitabine works by as a nucleoside proxy and binds DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) as the cell divides. This binding is permanent, and the DNMT is no longer available for modifying the epigenetic marks within the genome. Given that this is a mechanism that only works in replication, it relies on cell division in order to work. As cancer cells divide more rapidly, they are more severely affected and thus the modified epigenetic marks will be passed on more strongly and rapidly, ensuring a strong anti-neoplastic effect in order to kill tumour cells.  </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic marks, such as those laid down through a pattern of DNA methylation, can persist for both the lifetime of the cell and be mitotically heritable, being passed along to daughter cells. A sensitive period occurs when there is genome-wide erasure of prior epigenetic marks during epigenetic reprogramming. Although the precise timings of the clearing of epigenetic marks varies by parental allele, in general there are sensitive periods during early development of the embryo and up to implantation. However, more relevant for cancer treatment is the sensitive period that occurs during the development of primordial germ cells occurring in pre-puberty leading up to the development of gametes. Whilst age of onset of puberty varies widely as a consequence of genetics and environmental factors, a sensitive period might be (approximately) anywhere between the age of 8-10, up until early adolescence depending upon the gender and phenotype of the individual. Treatment during this time may affect the developing germ cells, which may have consequences for both the children and grandchildren of the affected individual.</div>
