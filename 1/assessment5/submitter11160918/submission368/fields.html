    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">CpG islands in gene promoters are normally not methylated. This allows the expression of the gene. In cancer, CpG islands in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes are hypermethylated, which inhibits their expression, so that the genes can't suppress tumors.<br /><br />Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated, so that they are not expressed. If they become less methylated, they will be more likely to be expressed, leading to genomic instability and cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the paternal allele, Igf2 is expressed because the ICR is methylated and the insulator protein that insulates Igf2 from enhancers can not bind to the ICR, so the enhancers are free to operate on the Igf2 gene, which is then expressed. This methylation also spreads to the adjacent H19.<br /><br />In the maternal allele, Igf2 is not expressed because the ICR is unmethylated and thus the enhancer-blocking protein binds to it and the enhancers can not operate on the Igf2 gene. Instead they operate on H19.<br /><br />The imprinting is that only the paternal allele produces Igf2. In Wilm's tumor, the ICR on the maternal allele becomes methylated and thus the maternal allele also produces Igf2. So there is an excess of the insulin growth factor which produces Wilm's tumor.<br /><br />The disruption of imprinting leads to overproduction of Igf2, which produces abnormal growth, a hallmark of cancer. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNMTi, that is, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. It binds to methylated DNA and inhibits the action of DNMT upon replication, so that the daughter genes are hypomethylated. If Decitabine demethylates the promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes, then they will be expressed to act against tumors.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable so that any methylation patterns are passed on to daughter cells. Alteration of this pattern will thus be passed on to future generations of the cell. Sensitive periods of development are when DNA methylation marks are erased and then rewritten. This happens during early development of the embryo and also during formation of the gametes, or sex cells (eggs and sperm). Treating patients during these periods would be inadvisable because any alterations would probably be erased and thus of little use -- better to wait until after the methylation patterns are rewritten.</div>
