    <div class="field-value"><span></span><div>In general in a normal cell you find that the CpG islands are hypomethylated, and the intergeneic</div><div>regions, introns and repetitive elements are hypermethylated. In a cancer cell, as a rule of thumb</div><div>you observe a reversal in this pattern: CpG islands are more likely to be hypermethylated, and</div><div>the latter regions are hypomethylated. For the CpG islands, this leads to problems as tumor</div><div>suppressor genes may become silenced, allowing the cell to divide more rapidly, outcompete its</div><div>neighboring cells, and grow into a tumour. For the latter regions, normally hypermethylation at</div><div>these sites is associated with greater genomic stability, so hypomethylation during cancer leads</div><div>to copying errors such as deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations in the</div>chromosomes.<span> DNA methylation is also essential for proper embryonic development.<br /></span><span>The epigenome of cancer cells displays numerous alterations in comparison to the epigenome of their normal counterpart. Changes in DNA methylation include a genome-wide loss and a regional gain of DNA methylation. This causes on one hand genomic instability and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes and on the other hand silencing of tumor suppressor genes – controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair – by hypermethylation of their promoter CpG islands.<br /></span>Intragenic methylation is found at repetitive sequences such as satellite repeats and remnants of retroviral insertions such as LINEs and SINEs in human DNA. <span><br /></span>cancer cells exhibit hypomethylation of intergenic regions which normally comprise the majority of a cell's methyl-cytosine content. Consequently, transposable elements may become active and contribute to the genomic instability observed in cancer cells. Simultaneously, cancer cells exhibit hypermethylation within the promoter regions of many CpG island-associated tumor suppressor genes, such as the retinoblastoma gene (<i>Rb1</i>). As a result, these regulatory genes are transcriptionally silenced resulting in a loss-of-function. Thus, through the effects of both hypo- and hyper-methylation,<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In humans the <i>IGF2</i> allele inherited from the father (paternal) is expressed; the allele inherited from mother is not. If both alleles expressed in a cell, that cell may develop into a cancer.</p>In <b>paternal </b>copy of <i>IGF2r</i> gene, promoter for <i>IGF2r</i> transcription is methylated, but the downstream promoter is unmethylated. Transcription of antisense strand from the downstream promoter produces an antisense RNA that participates in shutting his gene down.<br />In <b>maternal</b> copy of the gene, there is an upstream promoter that is unmethylated. Binding of transcription factors to this upstream promoter enables transcription of the sense-strand of gene to produce <b>Igf2r-messenger-RNA</b>.<br /><br />the embryo needs the father's <i>Igf2</i><span> gene because the mother's copy has been imprinted and is inactive.</span><ul><li>An insulator(CTCF bounded) prevents her <i>Igf2-</i>gene from interacting with enhancers needed to turn it ON.</li><li>The father's copy of the gene can be turned on because methylation of insulator prevents binding by CTCF so enhancers interact with the gene.</li></ul><ul><li>Failure of imprinting in somatic cells may lead to <b>cancer</b>.<ul><li>The cancerous cells in <b>Wilms´ tumour</b> have both copies of the <b><i>IGF2</i></b> gene expressed (where only one, the father's, should be).</li><li><b>Reduced methylation</b> (increased expression) of proto-oncogene can lead to cancer, while</li><li><b>increased methylation</b>  (decrease expression) of tumour suppressor gene can also do so.</li></ul></li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a hypomethylated agent. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. It is used in treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).<span><br />Decitabine inhibit DNA methyltransferases or histone deacetylases have the potential to reactivate silenced genes and induce differentiation or apoptosis of malignant cells. </span><p>Decitabine's anticancer effects are believed to be two fold. One way that it works is by demethylation or interfering with the methylation of DNA. By this process of demethylation, normal function to the tumor suppressor genes is restored, thus restoring control over cell growth.</p><p>Decitabine also belongs to the category of chemotherapy called antimetabolites. Antimetabolites are very similar to normal substances within the cell.  When the cells incorporate these substances into the cellular metabolism, they interact with a number of targets within the cell to produce a direct cytotoxic effect that causes death of rapidly dividing cancer cells.</p><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>DNA methylation is a particularly attractive form of regulation to target in treatments because it</div><div>can be manipulated once, and enduring effects are ensured as the DNA methyltransferase</div><div>enzymes preserve methyl marks during mitosis. However, these global interventions may</div><div>interfere with ordinary functioning of the system, especially during critical periods, periods</div><div>of time where extensive epigenetic reprogramming occurs. In particular, it would be inadvisable to</div><div>prescribe these treatments to pregnant mothers (including a few months before conception) as</div><div>a lot of reprogramming happens in early child development as well as during the formation of</div><div>gametes (both male and female).</div></div>
