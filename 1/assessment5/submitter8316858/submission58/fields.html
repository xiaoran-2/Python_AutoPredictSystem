    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation does not tend to
occur at CpG islands. However, if it occurs at CpG islands then it is almost universally
synonymous with silencing of gene expression.</p>

<p>CpG islands are hypomethylated in a
normal cell. In a cancer cell, CpG islands are more likely to be methylated.
This is called CGI hypermethylation.</p>

<p>In general, CGIs are found in the promoters
of tumour suppressor genes. CGI hypermethylation silences their expression. DNA
methylation is mitotically heritable. This can be one of the hits in terms of
Knudson hypothesis. So the cell ends up forming a tumor rather than dying.</p>

<p>One of the functions of DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to maintain
genomic stability i.e. no loss/gain of chromosomes and no illegitimate
recombinations. In a normal cell these are heavily methylated and heterochromatinized.</p>

<p>In cancer cells we have
hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements.</p>

<p>As a result, these cells are not densely
packaged into heterochromatin. Cancer cell packaging is more like open
chromatin or euchromatin. So illegitimate recombination can occur. Also the
repeats can be activated because of the hypomethylation, i.e. they jump around
the genome or transpose. They may disrupt the coding region of a gene but it
also may activate neighboring genes. Thus, genomic stability is compromised
causing deletions, insertions and translocations in chromosomes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, the Imprint
Control Region (ICR) is methylated in the paternal allele. So, enhancers can act
on Igf2, because CTCF is not binding to insulator element, and Igf2 is expressed
from the paternal allele.</p>

<p>In a normal cell, the ICR is
unmethylated in the maternal allele. So CTCF is bound to insulator element
causing the enhancers to act on H19. So, Igf2 is silent from the maternal
allele.</p>

<p>Loss of imprinting at the H19/Igf2
cluster causes hypermethylation of ICR on the maternal allele.</p>

<p>This results in expression of Igf2
from maternal allele causing a double dose of Igf2 compared to a normal cell. Igf2
is growth promoting and this is associated with Wilm’s tumor, a childhood
kidney tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating
agent. It belongs to DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) class of epigenetic
inhibitors.</p>

<p>At lower doses Decitabine causes DNA
demethylation and has anti-neoplastic effect. At high doses it is toxic.</p>

<p><span>Decitabine would get incorporated
into the DNA upon replication. When the DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1) comes
along to bind that nucleotide to copy the methylation to the daughter strand,
the DNA methyltransferase is bound irreversibly and it can no longer be
released. Cancer cells which divide much more rapidly than most other cells in
the body would be more severely affected. We do not know that DNA demethylation
is their only mechanism of action. It is only myelodysplastic syndrome where DNMTi
drugs seem to be most effective. It 
might be dependent on CpG island
hypermethylation which has a poor prognostic  outcome for myelodysplastic syndrome.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA
methylation is mitotically heritable. The cells that have epimutation are more
likely to divide more rapidly or not die as much. This is how we think cancers
eventuate. Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter
and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though,
they do not return.</p>

<p>Sensitive
periods are periods of exposure when changes in the environment have the
biggest effect.</p>

<p>Two
sensitive periods of development are 1) Primordial germ cell development and 2)
Early embryonic development.</p>

<p><span>Epigenetic
reprogramming occurs during sensitive periods for totipotency for the next generation.
Epigenetic marks are removed during these sensitive periods. Taking a drug that inhibits the epigenetic
machinery would be a large insult to the environment during sensitive periods.
We do not want this insult to propagate through mitotic heritability later on.</span></p></div>
