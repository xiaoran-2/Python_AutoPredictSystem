    <h1>Submission 13 from Anon (session_user_id: 020aa39fa91f752976013f7e320691dedff864f0)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine
is a "DNA Methytransferase Inhibitor" (DNMTi) (also called a "DNA
demethylating agent") approved in 2006 by the FDA <span>used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).  Its </span>main effect is
inhibiting DNA methyltransferase, which in MDS is methylating promoters of
tumor supressor genes. Decitabine affects only DNA strands, while related compounds
(e.g., azacitidine) affect both DNA and RNA.</p>

<p>It is thought that the demethylation effect
produced by Decitabine works to reverse the inactivation of tumor-suppressor
genes, and thus restore the function of those genes.  One other effect is as an 'antimetabolite,'
such that incorporation of the compound into rapidly dividing cancer cells has
a cytotoxic effect resulting in cell death (apoptosis), withe emphasis on
targeting abnromal blood cells in the bone marrow.  Thus the overall effect is both "proliferation
control and apoptosis sensitivity" in tumor cells (Stresemann and Lyko, Modes of action of
the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. Int J Cancer:123:8-13, 2008).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In general, CpG islands are unmethylated,
which has the effect of allowing gene expression.  In cancer cells, the reverse is true, and CpG
islands tend to become hypermethylated, and thus silenced; this is especially
problematic if the genes affected have a tumor suppressor function.  </p><p>For introns, intergenic regions and repetitive
elements, this pattern is reversed: they are normal methylated and thus
suppressed, but in cancer they become hypomethylated and can thus become
active.  Activity in these areas tends to promote genomic instability, including movement of sections of genetic code
(transposable elements) at random throughout the genome, as well as activation
of 'cryptic promoters' with corresponding disruption of nearby genes.</p><p>In short, the general pattern seen in normal cells is reversed
in cancer: levels of 5-methyl-cytosine genome-wide decline (i.e., become hypomethylated),
while hypermethylation of CpG islands rises, especially in areas associated
with tumor suppressor genes.  The net effect is an increase
in uncontrolled pro-growth oncogene activity with a decrease in tumor
suppression activity.  This can allow
cells to successful circumvent normal host defenses and display the 'hallmarks of
cancer,' both genetic and epigenetic, characteristic of the disease.<br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>For the paternal
allele, the H19/Igf2 locus is normally methylated at the ICR, while for the maternal
allele the H19/Igf2 locus is normally unmethylated.  The insulator protein CTCF can thus bind to
the maternal allele, blocking IgF2 expression and allowing downstream enhancers
to allow expression of H19.  CTCF complex
does not bind to the paternal allele because of methylation, such that the methyl
marks silence the H19 gene.  Paternal
allele enhancers, however, can thus promote expression of Igf2.   The net effect is a balance of H19 from the
maternal allele and IgF2 from the paternal allele. <br /></p><p>If imprinting
at the maternal allele is disrupted by methylation at the ICR for H19/ICF2, CTCF
binding is blocked, and both alleles appear to be of paternal origin.  This allows doubled expression of IgF2 (i.e.,
from both alleles), and similar corresponding suppression of H19.  The enhanced growth promoting effect of IgF2
in the absence of the control normally provided by H19 can this cause the
cancerous growth known as Wilm's tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A sensitive period is one in
which parental epigenetic marks have been removed, and new marks can be laid
down.  Environmental influences which can
affect epigenetic marking and gene expression include temperature (e.g., sex of
turtles, flowering of tulip bulbs) and diet (e.g., development of a queen bee).  Sensitive periods are during the development
of primordial germ cells, and during the pre-implantation and early
post-implantation period (in mammals) when the fertilized egg is developing and
the epigenome is being assembled ('remodelled').  </p><p>In so far as drug treatments
alter patterns of epigenetic marks, they have the potential to leave a lasting
trace on the cells they affect, as such marks are stably reproduced over many
cycles of cell division, ususally throughout the life of the organism (mitotically
heritable).  Removal of acetyl groups
(activation) or addition of methyl groups (suppression) can lead to changes in
gene expression long beyond the period of therapy. <br /></p><p>The developing embryos of pregnant
women would be especially susceptible to the effects of drug treatment, and
even medication administered prior to pregnancy could have a lasting
deleterious effect.<br /></p><p><br /></p></div>
