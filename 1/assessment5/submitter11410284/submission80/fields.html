    <h1>Submission 80 from Anon (session_user_id: f3a6b7739842c7a128e354a036652c64cee3c4a5)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is considered a DNA-demethylating/ hypomethylating agent and it is used to treat Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS). In MDS, DNA is hypermethylated, and this hypermethylation causes inactivation of some genes that control <b>normal</b> cell growth, differentiation or apoptosis (critical features for cancer progression), allowing tumor cells to escape from tumor growth control <br />Described mechanism of action of Decitabine is trough inhibition of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), that are in charge of methylate cytosine residues in newly synthesized DNA. Since hypermethilation is found in MDS, inhibition of DNMTs (produced by Decitabine) produce a decrease in global DNA methylation and it can lead to the re-expression of some tumor suppressor genes and, therefore, a better control of tumor progression. <br />Unlike Azacitidine (another demethylating agent) Decitabine is only incorporated to DNA strands (not RNA).<br /><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2376088/pdf/tcrm-0305-807.pdf" title="Link: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2376088/pdf/tcrm-0305-807.pdf">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2376088/pdf/tcrm-0305-807.pdf</a><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer,
several aberrations have been found in DNA methylation, histone modification
and variants, nuclear architecture and non-coding RNAs. In DNA methylation,
failure of epigenetic control has been found in both CpG islands and
genome-wide methylation status.</p>

<p><span>CpG islands in
normal cells are usually hypomethylated and located in the promoters of genes<a></a>, therefore allowing the expression of downstream genes. Frequently,
these genes are related to normal growth control. However, in cancer many CpG
islands in the promoter of tumor suppressor genes become hypermethylated,
silencing the expression of these genes and leading to situations of abnormal
cellular growth.</span></p>

<p>In the other
hand, methylation is found in intergenic regions and repetitive elements of
normal cells to control the expression of these genes. But in cancer,
demethylation of these sites causes genomic instability and it has consequences
as illegitimate recombination, activation of repeats and transposition. Loss of
methylation and the genomic stability created in these sites, can lead to the overexpression
of tumor promoting genes, enhancing tumor progression.</p>

<p>In this point,
hyper -or hypomethylation at ICRs (Imprint control regions) is also able to
control the expression of some other genes involved in the control of normal
growth. Even more, this epigenetic alterations, can occur in genes related to
the expression of proteins involved in epigenetic control by themselves (as DNMTs,
HATs, HDACs, etc,…) giving rise to new failures in epigenetic control.</p>

All these modifications, can also alter DNA structure
and spacial distribution of hetero- and euchromatin, that controls the “accessibility”
of the genes and, therefore, its expression. Alterations of the different
epigenetic marks are useful to the diagnosis and prognosis of some cancers, and,
unlike mutations, they are reversible, what means that they are susceptible for treatment.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinted genes
are those in which the expression comes out from just one of the alleles, the
paternal or the maternal one. The expression of these impinted genes is controlled
by Imprint Control Regions (ICRs or differentially methylated regions).
Deregulation if these control, can lead to changes of the expression of some
proteins and this causes different disorders. Sometimes, this loss of control is
due to epigenetic alterations, as in the case of the H19/Igf2 cluster (located
around an ICR) in Wilm's tumor.</p>

<p>In the maternal
allele, ICR is not methylated, what makes possible the binding of the CTCF
insulator protein, that leads in the expression of the downstream gene H19 and some enhancers that
will act on that active H19 gene. In the paternal allele, ICR hypermethylation
spreads to H19 promoter, silencing its expression. Enhancers previously
mentioned, are now free to bind to the Igf2 locus and activate it.</p>

<p>In Wilm's tumor,
hypermethylation of ICRs in both paternal and maternal alleles, lead to the
silencing of the H19 locus, so enhancers of both alleles are free to bind the Igf2 locus producing therefore the overexpression of Igf2.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alterations in DNA methylation have been
demonstrated as responsible of some tumor progression features. Unlike
mutations, epigenetic failures are reversible, so the use of drugs targeting
the epigenetic machinery can help to improve results in patient treatment. </p>

<p>Other treatments like chemotherapy, work by
causing cellular death. In contrast, drugs targeting the epigenetic machinery,
can lead to the activation/inactivation of some genes and, therefore, some cellular pathways in order to
restore the normal behaviour of the cell  and its progenie, having long-lasting
effects.</p>

However, since systemically administered, these drugs will need to be managed
with caution. Besides their effect in cancer cells, normal cells can also be
affected by these treatments. Normal cells have different sensitive periods
(as germ cell development and early embryonic development) during which
clearance and restoring of epigenetic marks occurs. In these specifics sensitive periods and cells, alterations produced for
the drugs could have unexpected effects. As talking about germ cells, some of these alterations could pass through gametes, being the offspring also affected.</div>
