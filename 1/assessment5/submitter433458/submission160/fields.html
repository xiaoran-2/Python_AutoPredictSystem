    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><span>In the normal DNA, methylation is commonly present at poor promoters, intergenic regions, and repetitive elements. The methylation in this case correlates with the silencing of these elements, and therefore controlling their propagation. Further, normal DNA is not methylated at the CpG islands located at the promoters of the genes. These epigenetic marks remain in the organism, and are only altered during the sensitive periods of epigenetic reprograming. In cancer cells however, methylation of the DNA exhibits the opposite pattern of that previously mentioned, this is hypermethylated at the CpG islands, and hypomethylated at the intergenic regions and repetitive elements. Although the mechanisms of cancer differ among types, DNA methylation at the CpG island has been associated with the silencing of tumour suppressor genes, thus contributing to cancer proliferation. Furthermore, it has been found that increase of methylation at CpG islands correlates with tumorigenicity. On the other hand, hypomethylation at repetitive elements in cancer cells contributes to genome instability, while at poor promoters is been linked with activation of oncogenes.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Disruption of imprinting due to excess or lack of methylation at the imprinting control regions (ICR)  may promote the expression of growth promoting genes,  or/and the silencing of growth depressor genes. For instance, at the  H19/Igf2 cluster of a normal cell the ICR is demethylated for the maternal allele. This attracts an insulator protein that blocks the action of downstream enhancers into the Igf2, making them act instead towards the expression of  H19 gene. On the other hand, the ICG in the paternal allele is methylated, thus allowing the enhancers to promote Igf2  expression.  In the Wilm’s tumour case, both alleles are methylated, consequently H19 is kept silent, while the growth promoter gene Igf2 is overexpressed (therefore promoting aberrant cell growth). </span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Decitabine is an approved drug used in humans subjects and is aimed to reduce methylation of  DNA acting in a similar manner to GSK2816126, a non commercial drug tested on animal models. As in the case of the animal studies treated with GSK2816126,  decitabine seems to be able to control histone hypermethylation, and as a consequence reduce the silencing of tumor suppressor genes.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Current epigenetic drugs for cancer change methylation of the DNA. DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, meaning that the epigenetic marks are passed to the new cells. Thus, the epigenetic modifications due to the drug can be transmitted during cell division, however this might not be desirable during the development sensitive periods. Sensitive periods are the times of human development at which the epigenetic marks, including methylation, undergo reprogramming: during germ cell development and during pre-implantation of the embryo. If methylation is altered during this “natural erasing”, further alterations of the epigenome may take place. The new stochastic alterations could then lead to aberrations in the “read out” of the genome.</span></div>
