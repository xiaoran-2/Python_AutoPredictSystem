    <h1>Submission 601 from Anon (session_user_id: 663a88d47e3f5ff58a742570ae0408bd6024e8fb)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation can have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment due to the transmissibility of methylation patterns from generation to generation of cells via mitosis. This would enable more effective chemotherapy treatments because of susceptibility being passed from mother to daughter cells.<br />However, exposure to epigenetic drugs would be inadvisable to patients during sensitive periods, that is, periods of development that would alter the afterwards methylation of the genome in the entire body. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine may be used to treat some kinds of cancer, since it is a DNA demethylating agent. It demethylates DNA acting as a methyltransferase inhibitor in cells that undergo mitosis, reducing the overall methylation on CpG islands, and thus permitting gene expression. This normal gene expression would prevent tumour formation.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is altered in two main ways in cancer cells: first, cancer cells show more methylation in CpG islands, and they also exhibit less methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br />DNA methylation prevents the expression of methylated DNA regions. In CpG islands (regions of the genome with high rates of CG) DNA tends to be unmethylated, especially in promoter regions, and thus genes can be normally expressed. In cancer cells, CpG promoter islands become hypermethylated, which causes silencing of the methylated gene.<br />Regions of the genome between genes -called intergenic regions- and repetitive sequences in the genome -repetitive elements- are methylated in normal/healthy cells. This means that these regions are not translated and don't code proteins. However, in cancer cells these parts of the genome are undermethylated, and consequently are more likely to be expressed. Expression of intergenic regions and repetitive elements is correlated with some kinds of cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Disruption of imprinting contributes to cancer by allowing expression of normally silent genes, or permitting expression on only one alelle. <br />In Igf2 expression, for example, imprinting on the paternal allele allows expression of lncRNA AIR that silences maternal protein-coding gene Igf2 in trans. In the maternal allele, enhancers inhibit methylation on H19 promoter, that is expressed.<br />In Wilm's tumour, the disruption of the imprinting contributes by promoting cell growth via Igf2 expression, which is haplosufficient and doubling the expression enhances tumour formation.</div>
