    <h1>Submission 91 from Anon (session_user_id: 941ea89cb01ad7405680f3a7cfd4af9016ec27ab)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the genome because
 these alterations are mitotically heritable: they are passed on to 
daughter cells during cell division and they remain in the cell line. All the cells derived from a treated cell may have inherited some alterations ,caused by the drug in the original treated cell, that make them more susceptible to chemotherapy.<br />Sensitive periods are period of intense epigenetic reprogramming, and the main sensitive periods are during the early embryonic development and during germ cells development.<br />During these sensitive period the epigenome is particularly sensible to environmental influences, so it's inadvisable to treat a pregnant patient because we could alter the epigenetic marks of her child and of her child's germ cells too. It would be also inadvisable to treat children with such drugs because the germ cells are still developing in young individuals.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">CpG island are usually unmethylated. In cancer we have methylation at CpG islands. CpG islands methylation can lead to the silencing of the following gene (CpG islands are found at the start of a gene and they are promoter of the gene), so methylation at particular CpG islands could lead to silencing of tumour suppressor genes. <br />Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated and so not expressed. In cancer, we see a general hypomethylation genome-wide and as consequence we see genome instability: activation of repeats, abnormal recombination between repeats, repeats that can jump through the genome disrupting part of it or contributing to activation of silenced part of it. This genome instability can lead to mutations, to the silencing of tumour suppression genes or to the activation of growth promoter and in general it's associated with cancer.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The imprinting control region is methylated on the paternal allele, leading to expression of Igf2, and unemthylated on the maternal allele where Igf2 is unexpressed. Methylation in the paternal allele blocks the action of CTCF (an insulating protein) and this leads to expression of igf2 whereas on the maternal allele  CTCF insulates Igf2 from his enhancers and so Igf2 is not expressed.<br />Igf2 is overexpressed in <div>Wilm’s tumour because we have methylation on both the paternal and maternal alleles.  Igf2 is a growth promoter and this "double dose" express both from maternal and paternal allele is associated with tumorigenesis and in specific with Wilm's tumour.  <br /></div><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. It acts as an inhibitor of DNMT, causing hypomethylation and reactivation of cancer-silenced genes. Normally cancer is associated with hypermethylation at CgG island and with silencing of tumour suppressor genes, decitabine removing methylation could reactivate tumour suppressor genes.<br /> <br /></div>
