    <h1>Submission 604 from Anon (session_user_id: 73d243cb1d6f18d58f1aeea89c268972fd7ff09a)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine works as a methyltransferase inhibitor. It acts by incorporating itself into the DNA when replication occurs and irreversibly binding DNA methyltransferases when they arrive to change DNA methylation. It has a more powerful effect on rapidly dividing cells (such as cancer cells). This has a hypomethylating effect, which could be wanted in case the disease presents itself by having hypermethylation at tumor supressor genes, for example. Removing methylation from those areas could make them accessible again, somewhat regulating cell division (which is usually very precarious in cancer). Decitabine has also another antineoplastic effect, as it has been described as an antimetabolite drug.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation acts by suppressing the expression of the gene thats being methylated. This is heritable through cell division, so when epigenetic changes are inflicted to the genome, they may be passed to the next generation of cells, even though the patient is not being subjected to the drug anymore. A sensitive period is an interval of time at which our genome may be more epigenetically influenced by the environment. Examples of that include the primordial germ cell development until the production of mature sperm and eggs, pre-implantation period and early post-implantation period. It could be harmful to treat patients going through sensitive periods with epigenetic modifying drugs, because although there has not been any big consequences for cells not undergoing any specific special epigenetic state, those on sensitive periods can be very severely affected, possibly being iatrogenic to the patient and doing more harm than good. In regards to cancer, we really have to think very hard before making any kind of decision, as the treatment can also bring serious side effects for the patients. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Usually, CpG islands will be associated with the start of a gene, being identified as promoter regions. When methylation is found on those regions, it is generally associated with silencing of that gene. In cancer, hypermethylation can be found in CpG islands located on promoters of tumor supressor genes, which would make those regions inactive, derailing control of cell division. This very commonly occurs in cancer, being an event identified to happen in multiple different types of malignant tumors. In regards to intergenic regions and repetitive elements, usually, on a normal cell, we observe methylation. But when cancer cells are analyzed, those regions tend to be hypomethylated, in contrast to what happens in CpG islands. That can bring genomic instability (as one of the aims of DNA methylation is to maintain genome stable), shown by illegitimate combinations between repeats (such as reciprocal translocations and misalignment). Genomic instability is also highly associated with cancer, as it damages DNA and turns cell division into an aberrant process. Combining those two events described, we have a very powerful base for the development of tumorigenesis. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the H19/Igf2 cluster, methylation at the imprint control region can be only observed on the paternal allele (so this is the one being imprinted). Because of this, production of H19 is only observed in the maternal allele. Enhancers found on the genome are able to influence H19 production and bind to the CTCF protein, which operates as an insulator, making them not capable of acting on Igf2 and enhancing the fabrication of H19. On the paternal allele, however, H19 is methylated (as is the CTCF binding protein region), so the enhancers can act solely on Igf2. The way that this is linked to cancer is that almost all imprinted genes are related to the controlling of growth (known to be out of control in cancer). When this disease occurs, there is mostly loss of imprinting, with hypermethylation or hypomethylation in imprint control regions (depending on the gene role). In the case of H19/Igf2, not only we have hypermethylation in the paternal allele (as it is expected), this happens on the maternal allele as well, leading to a double dose of Igf2 and no production of H19. This is mainly associated with Wilm's tumor.</div>
