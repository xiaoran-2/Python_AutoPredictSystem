    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell the CpG islands are usually unmethylated. Given that they are mostly found in the promoter regions, low level of DNA methylation helps maintaining the promoters accessible to the transcription machinery. The transition to a neoplastic state is usually characterized by hypermethylation of the CpG islands, which has the consequence of silencing the genes that are under the control of those promoters; if the silenced gene has a tumour-suppressor function, then the cell will progress towards a more severe cancer state.<br />On the other hand, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually kept methylated in normal cells. This contributes to maintain them in a silent chromatin state, in order to ensure genomic integrity. Both intergenic regions and repetitive elements contain cryptic promoters that can be recognized by 
the transcription
 factors and illegitimately start transcription. Furthermore, the 
repetitive elements are prone to illegitimate recombination and some of them, if activated, are able to
transpose to other genomic locations. Cancer is characterized by a general loss of DNA methylation and the epigenetic state of intergenic regions and repetitive elements tends to be activated. This has deleterious effects on  genomic stability and gene expression. If the disrupted genes are oncogenes and/or tumour-suppressors, tumorigenesis will further progress.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Many imprinted genes have a function in cell growth, therefore their disruption often leads to tumorigenesis. Igf2 is an imprinted gene that promotes cell growth (oncogene) and only one of its alleles (the paternal one) is expressed in normal cells. The Imprint Control Region (ICR) of Igf2 is located downstream of the gene and is normally unmethylated on the maternal allele; this allows CTCF (an insulator protein) to bind the ICR and prevent enhancers (located even further downstream) to activate the expression of Igf2. On the contrary, the ICR on the paternal allele is methylated and cannot be bound by CTCF; the downstream enhancers are then free to promote Igf2 expression on the paternal allele. Wilm's tumour is caused by hypermethylations of the ICR and consequent expression of Igf2 on both paternal and maternal alleles. Given that Igf2 is an oncogene, its increased (doubled) expression leads to an abnormal promotion of cell growth, which is one of the hallmarks of cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi), which means that it interferes with the action of enzymes in charge of laying down methyl groups on the DNA. Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue and it can be incorporated in the DNA sequence upon replication. Whenever a DNMT enzyme binds to the DNA to lay down a methyl group, the incorporated Decitabine irreversibly binds to the enzyme, blocking its activity. This will decrease the level of DNA methylation in the cell. In case of tumours caused by hypermethylation at the promoters of tumour-suppressor genes, Decitabine is supposed to restore the normal expression of these genes by inhibiting the DNMTs that keep the promoters hypermethylated. The mechanism of action of Decitabine is DNA replication-dependent, therefore it can only affect actively dividing cells; cancer cells are mitotically more active than normal cells and should therefore be more severely affected.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Modifications of DNA methylation can be mitotically inherited because of the action of DNMT1. After DNA replication CpGs only retains methylation on the parent strand (hemi-methylated DNA). DNMT1 specifically recognizes hemi-methylated CpGs and adds a methyl group on the daughter strand. For this reason, as long as DNMT1 is active, alterations of DNA methylation are stably maintained throughout the life of the individual.<br />Sensitive periods are specific stages of development during which epigenetic marks are laid down. Given the (mitotically) heritable nature of DNA methylation, these stages are particularly sensitive to environmental alterations of DNA methylation. The most sensitive periods are considered to be during gametogenesis in Primordial Germ Cells (PGCs) and during early embryonic development, before implantation. At these points epigenetic marks are  erased genome-wide and newly laid down (epigenetic reprogramming). Additional lower-scale periods of reprogramming also happen later in development, to allow differentiation of specific organs and tissues.<br />If administered during these sensitive periods, drugs that alter DNA methylation could have deleterious effects on development, because the methylation patterns that are essential for viability and correct development will be wrongly laid down or not laid at all.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
