    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at CpG islands leads to gene silencing. Compared to normal cells, cancer cells show genome wide hypomethylation but hypermethylation at CpG islands. Frequently, methylation of CpG islands in cancer occurs at the promoters of tumour suppressor genes. Hypermethylation of CpG islands varies by tumour type and increases over time.<br />Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated in cancer cells compared to normal cells. A function of DNA methylation at these sites is genomic stability. When these sites become hypomethylated in cancer cells, genomic stability is compromised through illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes. This can lead to activation of growth promoter genes (oncogenes), contributing to tumour growth and cell longevity.<br />Overall, the changes in DNA methylation in cancer cells generally causes genomic instability, loss of imprinting, silencing of tumour suppressor genes and activation of growth promoter genes that together <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Cancer cells show alteration of DNA methylation at imprint control regions (ICRs) compared to normal cells, leading to a loss of imprinting which can contribute to cancer. In Wilm's tumour, the ICR in the Igf2 H19 cluster is hypermethylated. In normal cells the ICR of the paternal allele is methylated, whilst the maternal allele is unmethylated. The absence of methylation on the maternal allele allows CTCF to bind to the ICR, allowing enhances to act on H19 rather than Igf2 so Igf2 is effectively silenced. On the paternal allele, methylation of the ICR insulates it from CTCF, allowing the enhancers to act on Igf2. This leads to expression of Igf2 from the paternal allele only. In Wilm's tumour, imprinting is lost and the Igf2 H19 cluster is hypermethylated at the ICR leading to expression of Igf2 from both alleles. Igf2 is growth promoting and Wilm's tumour cancer cells effectively have a double dose of Igf2, promoting tumour growth and therefore contributing to cancer.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic alterations can be reversed and therefore present a possible target for cancer treatment. Pharmaceutical companies are developing small molecule inhibitors to target the epigenetic machinery to reverse the epigenetic abnormalities of cancer. The drug Decitabine belongs to a class of epigenetic inhibitors known as DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi). Decitabine is a nucleoslide analogue that is incorporarted into the DNA upon replication and irreversibly binds DNA methyltransferase 1 (DMT1) so that it cannot copy methylation to the daughter strand. Because the action of Decitabine is dependent on cell division, cells that are undergoing more rapid division, cancer cells, are more effected than normal cells. At low doses, DMNTi drugs have been shown to have an anti-tumour effect. The exact mechanism of action is still unclear but it is likely to reduce the methylation at CpG islands.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic alterations are mitotically heritable and therefore when a drug alters the epigentic state of cancer cells, that alteration is passed onto the daughter cells and so on while the cells divide. While the cells are still alive and actively dividing, these changes are passed on. <br />Epigenetic control is critical for genomic stability and therefore drugs that target the epigenetic machinery could induce side effects or other downstream consequences. This is of particular concern for younger patients or when considering treatment during sensitive periods. A sensitive period are periods that are particularly vulnerable to epigenetic modification and include periods such as the development of germ cells and embryogenesis when the epigenetic marks are laid down. Treating patients during these periods could lead to disruption of normal epigenetic control and normal development.</div>
