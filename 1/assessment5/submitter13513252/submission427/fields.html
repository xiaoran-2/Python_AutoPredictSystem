    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">CpG islands, regions rich in CpG sites, are usually unmethylated, which allows good transcription and expression of the DNA sequence.<br />In tumour cells, CpG islands are found to be hypermethylated, which may lead to reduced expression of the gene at which they are located. In particular, CpG island hypermethylation at promoter regions of tumour suppressor genes can lead to cancer: by silencing the DNA repair, apoptosis or cell cycle functions of those genes.<br />In intergenic regions or at repetitive elements, DNA methylation is important for DNA stability. In the body of highly expressed genes, DNA methylation is thought <span>to repress transcriptional aberrations of close enhancers and helps having adequate RNA splicing and replication timing. In cancer, those genomic regions tend to become hypomethylated, which leads to more transcription mistakes, favours translocation problems, inadequate DNA repair and more mutations, which in turn may cause cancer.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA-demethylating agents. <br />It acts by hypomethylating DNA due to switching off <a title="Link: null">DNA</a><span> methyltransferase proteins. <br />When DNA methyltransferase is no longer active, genes (in particular tumor suppressors) may be switched on which slows the growth of cancer cells, and the proliferation of cancer cells</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Because DNA methylation is a mitotically heritable biological phenomenon, altered DNA methylation can be passed on as cells divide, thanks to the epigenetic marks they carry. What is meant be a sensitive period is a period in the development where DNA methylation can be easily disrupted and reprogrammed. Sensitive periods include pregnancy in particular at early embryonic development , young age, gametes during conception periods. It would be inadvisable to treat patients during sensitive periods, because this is more likely to induce long-term, irreversible methylation changes, which may affect other mechanisms.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The maternal allele of H19 is usually unmethylated, and therefore expressed, which decreases the expression of Igf2.<br />The paternal allelle of H19 is usually methylated and therefore unexpressed, which increases the expression of Igf2.<br />Inbalance in the paternal vs maternal methylation pattern can lead to disease, for example in Wilm's tumour where loss of imprinting is found due to methylation of the maternal allele of H19, which results in overexpression of Igf2. Because Igf2 (Insulin growth factor 2) is regulated via H19, and because it promotes cell growth, this can lead to certain cancers, in particular Wilm's tumour.</div>
