    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are clusters of CpG sites found in the promoter region of certain genes. Normally, in most cases they are unmethylated in order to enable gene expression. However, in cancer there seems to be a CpG island hypermethylation, which results in silencing of their downstream genes. This hypermethylation is directly linked with cancer since it is mostly found in the promoter of tumour-suppressing genes.<br /><br /><span>Under normal conditions, CpGs in intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated in order to maintain genomic stability. In cancer, a hypomethylation of these sites occurs and is especially evident in repetitive elements. This hypomethylation induces genomic instability, which results in illegitimate recombinations between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition as well as activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighbouring genes.</span><br />    </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Usually, the paternal allele is methylated at the ICR, while the maternal is not. This means that CTCF complex can bind to the maternal allele but not the paternal one. As a result, downstream enhancers act on H19 of the maternal allele, while the paternal copy of H19 is silenced enabling the transcription of Igf2. <br /><br />In Wilm's tumour, the ICR is hypermethylated and the maternal allele acts as the paternal, producing Igf2 as well. Therefore, there is twice the dose of Igf2, which as a growth factor acts as an oncogene contributing to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent that can bind to DNA methyltranferases (the enzymes that catalyze the methylation reaction) and render them inactive. As a result, it can inhibit methylation and thus lead to the expression of previously hypermethylated silenced genes. Therefore, <span>tumour-suppressing genes will  be expressed again reducing the ongoing growth of the tumour.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>
			<div>
				<div>
					<div>
						<p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have effects that endure even after the end of treatment since DNA methyltransferases preserve methyl marks during mitosis enabling the effect of these drugs to be passed on to new somatic cells. <br /></p><p>However, these drugs affect the organism in a universal way and can obstruct its normal functions. This can be especially true in sensitive periods, meaning periods of
time where extensive epigenetic reprogramming is happening. So patients should not be treated during sensitive periods and this applies to pregnant women, even a few months before conseption because a part of this reprogramming happens in early child development as well as during the formation of gametes. </p>
