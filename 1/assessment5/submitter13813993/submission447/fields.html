    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor.  It is a nucleotide analogue that binds irreversibly to DNMT1. This means that their action is dependent on cell division and rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, will be more sensitive to it. The use of Decitabine decreases hypermethylation in dividing cancer cells, diluting any abnormal hypermethylation in the daughter cancer cells. This is however beneficial in cases where the cancer is dominated by abnormal hypermethylation and it is less effective in cases where the cancer is mainly due to abnormally hypomethylated regions.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are present at promoter regions of several genes. These regions are usually hypomethylated to allow gene expression. In cancer the CpG islands are often hypermethylated, which results in the repression of the associated genes. The Knudson hypothesis states that cancer is the result of accumulated mutations to the DNA. According to this hypothesis, several insults (hits) must accumulate in order to give rise to cancer and hypermethylation of CpG islands is considered one of the "hits" associated with cancer development, since it is mitotically inheritable and can accumulate through cell generations. Methylation of GpG islands is thus associated with silencing of tumour supressing genes, e.g. pRB gene in retinoblastoma and BRCA1 gene in breast cancer.<br />Repetitive elements of the DNA are highly unstable and have the risk of transposing into other parts of the genome. To reduce the chance of these transposition, these regions are normally hypermethylated. In cancer, these regions tend to be hypomethylated, which can result in genomic instability resulting from illegitimate recombinations or cryptic promoters. Intergenic regions are usually hypomethylated in cancer, which could also lead to activation of oncogenes through hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters, for example the activation of R-Ras in gastric cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The H19/Igf2 cluster contains an Imprint Control Region (ICR) that is hypomethylated in the maternal allele and hypermethylated (imprinted) on the paternal allele. Thus, the paternal allele is normally responsible for the expression of the Igf2 gene since the CTCF insulator cannot bind the ICR and the downstream enhancers will act on the Igf2 gene, while the H19 gene will not be expressed from this allele. On the other hand, the ICR is unmethylated on the maternal allele and CTCF is able to bind it, preventing methylation of the H19 promoter and Igf2 expression. Thus in the maternal allele, the H19 gene will be expressed and the Igf2 will  be silenced.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumour the ICR is methylated in both the maternal and paternal alleles, resulting in overexpression of the Igf2 gene from both alleles along with no expression of the H19 gene. Igf2 is a growth promoting gene (oncogene) and H19 is a long coding RNA that has tumour supressing activity. Thus, activation of the oncogene and silencing of H19 will result in cancer development.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">An altered DNA methylation pattern will have lasting effects on the epigenome of the organism, as these epigenetic marks are mitotically inheritable and will passed through several generations of daughter cells. The fact that the drugs had an effect that lasted beyond the treatment period could be because unlike other forms of gene regulation, such as transcription factors, epigenetic changes are passed during cell division to daughter cells until they are actively erased. Once they have been erased, they will not return. It might thus be that epigenetic therapies can induce a cancer to stop growing without having to kill all the tumour cells. A sensitive period is that when the epigenome is most sensitive to external (environmental) insults, which can lead to epimutations. During development the sensitive periods occur during pre-implantation development and primordial germ cell differentiation. It would not be advisable to treat patients during sensitive periods because altering DNA methylation at these stages could lead to undesirable epimutations that could result in a abnormal epigenome, affect the imprinting of many genes and have major consequences for normal development and cell proliferation. This can also have further transgenerational effects (e.g. Dutch famine).</div>
