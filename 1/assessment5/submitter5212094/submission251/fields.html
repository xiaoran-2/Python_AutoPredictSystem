    <h1>Submission 251 from Anon (session_user_id: d2b570065efdc9d9433532e8cee6c37178f43da1)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agents. The methylation overactivity around the  epigenetic area silences the expression of the tumour suppressor genes. once  Decitabine demethylates the DNA and the epigenetic area surrounding the tumour suppressor genes they can express and thus prevent the proliferation of cell division, thus suppressing cancer.    <br /></div>

    <div class="field-value">     DNA methylation is the basis for different epigenetic phenomena such as 
imprinting, X chromosome inactivation or the formation of 
heterochromatin <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3480634/#bib3"></a>. Generally, DNA methylation of promoter regions inversely correlates with gene expression. <br />     Exceptions are CpG islands, which are found in about 60% of promoters . They have a high CpG density and are usually kept free of methylation independent of their activity state.<br />     However, in cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene.<br />     The epigenome of cancer cells displays numerous alterations in 
comparison to the epigenome of their normal counterpart. Changes in DNA 
methylation include a genome-wide loss and a regional gain of DNA 
methylation.  This causes on one hand genomic instability and deregulation of tissue 
specific and imprinted genes and on the other hand silencing of tumor 
suppressor genes – controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair – by 
hypermethylation of their promoter CpG islands.<br />     Long-range silencing of repetitive sequences and formation of silent 
heterochromatin but also DNA access for transcription in euchromatin or 
DNA replication   are dependent on epigenetic mechanisms including   DNA 
methylation,   histone modification and remodeling, and non-coding RNA.<br />     In cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene . Intragenic methylation is found at repetitive sequences such as satellite repeats and remnants of retroviral insertions. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>

    <div class="field-value">      DNA methylation is the basis for different epigenetic phenomena such as imprinting.  Generally, DNA methylation of promoter regions inversely correlates with gene expression.         <br />       However, in cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become 
hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying genes<br />        Disruption of imprinting is Associated with misexpression of genes within specific imprinted clusters. Parent-of-origin dependent inheritance  Genetic (deletion, mutation, uniparental disomy) or epigenetic basis of disruption to imprinted gene cluster.<br />        The example of the H19/Igf2 cluster illustrates that on the maternal allele on chromosome 11 the CTCF protein being not methylated insulates the Igf2 gene from the down stream enhancers beyond the H19 promoter. <br />       On the paternal allele the CTCF is methylated which enables the enhancers downstream of the H19 promoter to activate the Igf2 which is an oncogene.<br />       In Wilm’s tumour maternal allele behaving like paternal allele,or Uniparental disomy, two copies of one parental chromosome causes  Fetal and post-natal overgrowth  due loss of Cdkn1c which is a tumour suppressor, or overdose Igf2 and/ or<br />other genes (oncogenes).<br />       As mentioned the disrupted imprinting H19/Igf2 cluster causes the silencing of the tumour suppressor Cdkn1c and the Upregulation of Igf2 oncogene, growth promoting. Thia contributes to cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation enables drugs to alter the epigenome nearby. epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased.It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which
 stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.<br />Periods of epigenetic reprogramming are sensitive periods.Also Sensitive periods during embryogenesis/gametogenesis, when marks are established rather than maintained. germ cell exposure, exposure after birth.  Mitotic heritability of any epigenetic difference brought about by environmental change is required to see a sustained alteration.<br />During sensitive periods the epigenetic is reprograming as well as the inheratability is unstable treating patients during this time is inadvisable. <br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
