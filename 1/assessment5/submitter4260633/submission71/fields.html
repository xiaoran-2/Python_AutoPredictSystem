    <div class="field-value"><p>Since CpG islands are most often found near promoters (where trascriprion machine attaches to start gene transcription) in  normal cells CpG islans  are not methylated. In general methylation of CpG islands is associated with gene silencing because methylated CpG islands recruit other proteins that pack chromatin more tightly (making it less accessable for transcription) or because they prevent transcription factors from binding directly. It aims at maintaining genome integrity, because it ensures that only the genes needed for that particular tissue are expressed and prevents other unwanted regions to be transcribed.</p><p>In cancer cells the reverse occurs. CpG islands are usually heavily methylated, preventing the expression of genes, among which there are genes that usually act as tumor suppressors. CpG methylation progresses in time. Moreover, since methilation is mitotically heritable, these feature allows cancer growth because daughter cells keep the same marks.</p><p>In normal cells intergenic regions and repetitive elements are heavily methylated, because the organism doesn't need more copies of genes, that , for instance, would jump into other parts of the genome, maybe disrupting the integrity of other useful genes. It's another mechanism by which the integrity of the genome is guaranteed, by preventing aberrant modifications like duplications, delitions and translocations. Another potentially dangerous event is illegitimate recombination. Recombination usually occurs betwenn homologous chromosomes during cell division. If short sequences of DNA regions outside chromosomes are repeatedly transcribed, they more likely will undergo illegitimate recombination.</p><p>Once again in cancer cells the reverse occurs and we observe hypomethylation thoughout the genome. It has been found in all tumors and it happens in the ealry stages.It leads to genome instability, because the aberrant modifications mentioned above are no longer held in check.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Usually imprinted genes (having only one parental allele expressed) are not found everywhere in the genome; rather they tend to form clusters, like the H19/Igf2 cluster.</p><p>In the maternal allele the ICR is not methylated so that protein CTCF can bind to it.CTCF acts as an insulator, preventing the downstream enhancer from binding to Igf2, as it would usually do (preferred chromatin looping).<br />In the paternal allele the ICR is methylated, CTCF can no longer bind to it so that the enhancer can act direct upon Igf2 gene, that is therefore expressed. Igf2 is an oncogene and its overexpression leads to cancer.<br />Many imprinted genes paly a role in cell growth, either promoting or suppressing it. Disruption of methylation in imprinted genes is therefore a hallmark of cancer. ICRs can be hypo- or hypermethylated, depending on which cluster we are dealing with. In Wilm's tumor imprinting is lost, the maternal ICR is methylated too, CTCF can no longer bind and cannot work as insulator, so that Igf2 is expressed both on the maternal and on the paternal chromosome. It's as though the cell inherited 2 paternal alleles. Since Igf2 promotes cell growth, its double dosage enables cancer to spread.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the DNA-demethylating agents, that is those chemicals that prevent CH3 groups from being laid down on the DNA. In cancer cells there is a locus-specific hypermethylation (in general close to promoters) that leads to silencing of the nearby genes. Methylation occurs also in histones. By either demethylating an activating mark or methylating a repressive mark, the end result is an overproliferation of cells. </p><p>Decitabine can stop overproliferation, bringing tumor under control, by preventing further methylation of the genes. The molecule of the Decitabine is a nuceoside analogous that is incorporated in the DNA upon replication.  When DNMT1 binds to the new DNA strand to methylate it, binding is irreversible and methylation cannot spread further.</p><p>This drug is therefore particularly useful when cells are actively dividing; that's the reason why this drug impacts more heavily on tumor cells than on normal cells and is well tolerated.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the genome the degree of methylation is a stable mark, because it is passed on during cell division, in order to ensure tissue homogeneity. When a drug changes DNA methylation, the new pattern is preserved during cell division, maintaining its effects on the genome. </p><p>During the cell life circle, however, there are two sensitive periods, i.e. periods during which methylation is erased and re-established.</p><p>The first sensitive period occurs just after fertilization. All tissues, with their different epigenetic marks, derive from the zygote, that must therefore be totipotent. But the zygote is the result of the fusion between egg and sperm and these cells have very peculiar epigenetic marks that need to be removed. Actually crhomatin is different in germ cells too.</p><p>The second sensitive period occurs at mid-gestation when embryonic germ cells develop from somatic cells.. Somatic epigenetic marks are removed and those peculiar of sperm and oocyte are established.</p><p>The use of epigenetic drugs (and drugs in general) during these sensitive periods must be as less as possible, because their effects (or side-effects) could interefere with the correct development of the embryo (threatening its viability too) or of its germ cells (possible causing infertility in adult life).</p></div>
