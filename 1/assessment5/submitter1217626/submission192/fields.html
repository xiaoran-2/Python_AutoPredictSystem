    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at CPG islands serves an important role in the regulatory processes for gene expression and is considered to play a critical role in normal development and cell function. CpG Islands are found in the promotor regions of most genes. For the most part these CpG Islands are not methylated, in the normal cases where they are methylated the binding of transcription factors is prevented and the gene is silenced. Methylated CpG Islands play a critical role in X chromosome inactivation, the maintenance of genetic imprinting, suppression of repetitive element transcription and transposition and in some cases in determining the cell type specific expression patterns.<br />In the development of cancer the methylation at these CpG Islands is disrupted in a couple of ways. The epigenetic hallmark of cancer shows a pattern of global intergenic regions, introns and repetitive elements hypomethylation and local hyper methylation of locus specific CpG Islands. Hypomethylation occurs at normaly methylated repeat elements which leads to genomic instability and oncogene activation. Hypermethylation of locus specific CpG islands occurs at promotor CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes which leads to heritable transcriptional silencing and can in addition lead to chromatin alteration. The silencing of the tumour suppressor genes leads to the ability of a cell to divide more rapidly and outcompete it's neighbouring cells growing into a tumour. <br />DNA methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements normally ensures greater genomic stability and oncogene suppression. In cancer these regions are hypomethylated which leads to more copying errors such as deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations in the chromosomes. Genomic stability is decreased and oncogenes can become activated.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The methylation pattern of the paternal allele in a cell in the H19/Igf2 locus normally shows the methylation pattern of methylation of the paternal allele at the ICR and no methylation of the maternall allele. In consequence the CTFC complex can not bind to the paternal allele because of the methyl marks which leads to silencing of the H19 gene as enhancers drive the expression of Igf2. The CTFC complex does bind to the allele on the maternal strand which causes the downstream enhancers to act on H19. So with a normal methylation pattern one would find both H19 from the maternal strand and Igf2 from the paternal strand in normal doses.<br />In Wilm's Tumor the ICR becomes hypermethylated. as a consequence both the paternal and the maternal allele appear as being of paternal origin. Because of this appearance both get expressed as paternal alleles leading to a double dose of Igf2 which is growthpromoting and lack H19.<br />Igf2 has been shown to promote somatic overgrowth and thereby drive the proliferation which leads to the formation of Wilm's tumor.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is an antineoplastic or cytotoxic chemo therapy drug belonging to the class of drugs classified as an antimetabolite and demethylation agent. It is intended for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia but currently it is also used in the trials for treatment of other types of cancer. Decitabine is a hypomethalyzing agent which in low doses inhibits DNA Methyltransferase thereby reactivating silenced tumor suppressor genes. It's actions are locus specific. During DNA replication AZA and DAC are incorporated into the replicating DNA where they can form covalent bonds with DNMT's, this proces called DNMT trapping leads to passive demethylation during DNA replication and cell division. In addition decitabine also demythalizes and thus promotes the expression of membrane transporters essential in chemotherapy uptake thereby increasing the effectiveness of chemotherapy in treatment of previously treatment resistant solid tumors.  </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Alterations in DNA methylation are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. When actively erased they do not return. This implies that epigenetic changes can be manipulated once and the effects are preserved through DNA methyltransferases preserve methylation marks during mitoses. In addition epigenetic manipulation might cause a decline in cancer growth without having to kill all of the cells involved and without damage to healthy tissue. <br />Sensitive periods are periods of epigenetic reprogramming when genome wide erasure and remodelling of DNA methylation and histone modifactions take place, during these periods (in the early embryo and during gametogenesis) there is increased sensitivity to epigenetic changes and environmental influences.Treating for instance pregnant females or females intending to become pregnant within a couple of months during these periods would have effects on the forming gametes and the embryo in early development. </div>
