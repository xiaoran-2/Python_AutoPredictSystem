    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are mainly unmethylated in a normal cell, reducing the risk of conversion of meC to thymine, and thereby mutagenesis. However, methylation of CpG islands are important for X inactivation and imprinting in normal cells.<br /><br />In cancer, there is, overall, hypermethylation at CpG islands, which tends to increase as cancer progresses. Hypermethylation of CpG islands at tumour suppressor genes can in fact be more frequent than mutation. Hypermethylation will lead to silencing of tumour suppressor gene expression, leading to impaired cell cycle control. CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) tumours have been described as a distinct class of tumours, and has been described in colorectal cancer, glioma, neuroblastoma among others.<br />In addition to silencing of tumour suppressor genes, hypermethylation can cause a loss of imprinting. Many imprinted genes regulate growth and its signalling. Therefore, disrupted imprinting can lead to overexpression of growth factors e.g. disruption of H19/Igf2 imprint leading to Wilm's tumour.<br /><br />Methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements serve to promote genomic integrity/stability. More specifically, at intergenic regions, methylation silences cryptic promoters, preventing transcriptional intereference, and cryptic splice sites. At repetitive elements, methylation can also silence strong promoters contained within the element and prevent transcriptional interference and disruption of expression of neighbouring genes (e.g. <i>A</i>vy, <i>Axin</i>fu).<i><code></code></i><code></code><br /> In addition, methylation silences repetitive elements, preventing transposition and thereby genomic instability. It prevents illegitimate recombination. meC also tends to degrade into thymine over time. Therefore, methylation may serve to mutate repetitive elements into an inactive form.<br /><br />In cancer, there is an overall hypomethylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements. This can lead to inappropriate activation of oncogenes downstream of normally inactive promoters. Hypomethylation of repetitive elements can also lead to genomic instability, through illegitimate recombination. Activation of repetitive elements themselves, due to hypomethylation, result in mutegenesis through transposition.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The imprint control region (ICR) on the paternal allele is methylated. This methylation prevents the binding of CTCF, an insulating factor which normally insulates <em>Igf2</em> from the effects of the enhancers. Therefore methylation of this ICR leads to expression of <em>Igf2</em>. In addition, the methylation at the ICR spreads to the neighbouring CpG islands in the <em>H19</em> region, which silences H19.<br /><br />The ICR on the maternal allele is unmethylated. This means that CTCF can bind to the ICR. This means that<em> </em>enhancers cannot cause the expression of <em>Igf2</em>. In addition, the <em>H19 </em> gene remains unmethylated, allowing it to be expressed form the maternal allele.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumour, there is hypermethylation at the H19/Igf2 cluster. This means that the maternal allele now exhibits the paternal epigenotype. This means that there is an overexpression of <em>Igf2</em>, which codes for a cell growth signal, and underexpression of <em>H19</em>, which codes for a long non-coding RNA which regulates cell proliferation. This concurrent gain in growth signal and loss growth regulation promotes carcinogenesis.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. It reduces methylation of DNA by inhibiting the attachment of new methyl groups onto cytosine bases.<br /><br />Decitabine can reduce the hypermethylation at CpG islands that occurs in cancer. This reverses the silencing of tumour suppressor genes which promoted dysregulated cell proliferation leading to tumour.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. This occurs due to the activity of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), which is responsible for the maintenance of methyl marks at CpGs. CpGs are symmetrical, i.e. they occur at the same site on both strands. When a cell undergoes mitosis, only one of the two daughter strands will be methylated at these CpG sites. DNMT1 binds to and acts of hemimethylated sites on DNA, methylating the unmethylated strand.<br /><br />Sensitive period refers to the period that is particularly vulnerable to epigenetic disruption, when the genome is undergoing epigenetic reprogramming (i.e. clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks). This occurs during early development and primordial germ cell development.<br /><br />There is a far greater probability of undesired disruption of epigenome of normal cells if epigenetic drugs are administered during sensitive periods. In addition, the disruption in epigenome would be long-lasting. As such, epigenetic drugs would be best avoided during these sensitive periods.<br /></div>
