    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are gene
promoters. They promote gene transcription in a region of DNA, e.g.
tumors suppressor genes. In a normal cell these islands aren't
methylated, they are not silenced so the gene would express normally.
In a cancer cell it would be the opposite, the CpG island would be
methylated therefore silenced, and the gene wouldn't express
normally. This gives room to hypermethylation which increases the
chances for tumor development as it can play the same role as a
mutation.</p>
<p>The intergenic
regions and repetitive elements in a normal cell are methylated while
they aren't in a cancer cell. This contributes to the appearance of
illness like cancer since the accumulation of copies (repetitive
elements) can cause the accumulation of mutations.<br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> The gene Igf2 has as role of growht promoter during the gestation. Igf2 stimulates the cellular growth in the fetus e.g. in the kidney.</p><p>In the paternal allele is express Igf2 since the insulator protein
CTCF and the H19 promoter are silenced. Enhancers can access to Igf2
and activate it. In the maternal allele happens the opposite, the
insulator protein CTCF manages to bind to ICR, thus blocking access
to Igf2 and impeding it to express.</p>
<p>
In Wilm's tumor (kidney) the DNA methylation suffers an alteration due to ICR
hypermethylation, so much that Igf2 express in both maternal and
paternal alleles, causing an illness or disorder of the genomic
imprinting. This provokes an increase of Igf2 and a largest cell
proliferation that can be translated into a tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug <span> for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes</span>that that inhibits DNMT or DNA methyltransferasa. Decitabine provokes a decrease in
DNA methylation, thus reverting the genic silence.</p>
<p>
By means of this hypomethylation of the genic enhancers, reactivation
of the tumor suppressor genes can be achieved. Thus can be inhibited the excessive cellular proliferation.</p>
<p>
<br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation happens during the early development or
gametogenesis, and during primordial germ cell development or
embryogenesis. These are the ones we call sensitive periods. During
these periods happens the cell division and is when the epigenetic
marks are established. These pass between cells during the cell
division and are inherit to subsequent generations. Therefore it is
not advisable to treat patients during these periods since any change
would be long-lasting in time and be transgenerational.</p></div>
