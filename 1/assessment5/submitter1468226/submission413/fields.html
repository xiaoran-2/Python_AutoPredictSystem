    <div class="field-value">As clearly explained by Dr. Marnie Blewitt in lecture 7.2, DNA methylation is altered in cancer  in two ways: (a) <b>locus specific hypermethylation</b> and (b) <b>genome-wide hypomethylation</b>.<br /><br />(a) The normal cells present <b>active </b>promoters of tumor suppressor genes<b>, </b>their CpG islands are free of methylation. Introns, intergenic regions and repeats are methylated. In contrast,  in cancer, these promoters of tumor suppressors are <b>more likely to be silenced</b> by methylated CpG islands and CpG islands shores.  The rest of the genome--introns, intergenic regions and repeats--are unmethylated . (Egger et al.,,2004; Hassler and Egger, 2012). <br /><br />DNA hypermethylation causes cancer when occurring in genes that are important for suppressing tumors, controlling cell proliferation, repairing DNA, mediating apoptosis and many others (Cancer Epigenetics. Epigenie, 2015) <br /> <br />This locus specific hypermethylation occurs more often than mutations in cancer. It starts early, and it is often seen in pre-neoplastic tissue, progressing with time, and increasing with age. Therefore, methylation at some CpG islands has been used as biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer and metastasis. (Epigenetic MOOC. Blewitt, 2015)<br /><br />(b) Normal cells have highly methylated intergenic regions and repeats that maintain the genomic stability of the cell. In cancer, the repeats and the intergenic regions are hypomethylated, therefore, not densely packed down, and the genome becomes unstable. Then, the following processes can occur: activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters, illegitimate recombination between repeats,  and disruption of neighboring genes. (Epigenetic MOOC. Blewitt, 2015)<br /><br /> Hypomethylationto some degree occurs in all tumors. As it has been described for hypermethylation of CpG island, hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repeats, happens early in pre-neoplastic tissue, progressing with time. (Epigenetic MOOC. Blewitt, 2015).<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, e.g. in the case of the H19/Igf2 cluster, which is involved in promoting growth.<br /><br />In normal cells, the imprinted control region (ICR) H19/Igf2 is methylated on the paternal allele, and it is un-methylated on the maternal allele. The un-methylated ICR on the maternal allele binds to CTCF insulators. Therefore, Igf2 is silenced, and the enhancer on the maternal allele acts on H19 gene. Instead, on the paternal allele, the ICR is methyalted, Igf2 is not insulated and the enhancer can act on Igf2. Then, the growth promoter Igf2 is expressed.<br /><br />With loss of imprinting, the maternal allele will present a methylated ICR, and it will express Igf2 too. This double dose of Igf2 growth promotion has been associated with Wilm`s tumor,  a childhood kidney tumor. ICR methylations in the context of cancer are likely to occur early in pre-neoplastic tissue. (Epigenetic MOOC. Blewitt, 2015).<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is classified as an epigenetic inhibitor <b>DNA metaltranferase 1 </b>(DNMTi). It is a nucleoside analogue that is incorporated into DNA upon replication. When DNMT1 comes to bind  that nucleotide to copy the methylation to the daughter strand,  that DNMT binds irreversibly and then can no longer be released. In this way Decitabine causes DNA demethylation. (1 in Q4)<br /><br />Decitabine has been approved by FDA of the USA, and it is used around the world to treat  myelodysplastic 
syndrome that has progressed to Accute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). The action of DNMT is cell-division dependent. Since cancer cells divide much more often than normal cells, Decitabine will have a stronger effect in cancer cells. Decitabine is a demethylasing agent. Therefore, Decitabine might only be effective for the treatment of cancer related to CPG island hypermethylations, like haematological malignances. Other mechanisms of action might be involved, but are still unknown. (2)<b><br /></b><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, therefore it can have enduring
 effects on the epigenome. If a epigenetic drug is a demethylating 
agent, its demethylation will be passed mitotically  (See Decitable 
answer, Q3). Current research aims to create epigenetic therapies which 
stop cancer by affecting only mutated enzymes or proteins involved in 
epigenetic control, without affecting its nearby cells. (2= Cancer`s 
epicenter, The Economist 2012).<br /><br />Windows of 
vulnerability are called sensitive periods. Epigenetic control is 
important throughout development. It represents extra information added 
to the genetic information. Sensitive periods include: epigenetic 
reprogramming, zygote state, pre-, post- implantation and  mid-gestation
 embryonic state. Other sensitive periods are during the generation of 
sperms/eggs, and during the development of many different cell types at 
adulthood (e.g. blood cells). (1= Epigenetic MOOC. Blewitt, 2015). 
Therefore, if an current epigenetic drug is administrated during these 
sensitive periods, 
normal differentiation and development can be compromised. For these 
reasons, treating patients during development is inadvisable (younger 
patients or pregnant woman).<br /></div>
