    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell, the CpG islands are hypomethylated, whereas, in a cancer cell, the CpG islands are hypermethylated. This increased methylation leads to the silencing of tumor-suppressor gene(s) which otherwise prevents tumors from occurring.Not only are these islands possess these characteristics, but the 2kb CpG island shores that flank CGIs are also hypermethylated.These regions may also have some tumor biomarkers which are silenced as a result of these hypermethylation, leading to cancers. On the contrary, the intergenic regions, the repetitive elements and the poor CpG promoters are hypermethylated in a normal cell hence contributing to genome-wide stability. But, in case of cancer, a lower genome-wide methylation confers instability to the genome. An instable genome, therefore, is more prone to illgitimate recombination and resulting chromosomal aberrations, activation of repeats, transposons and cryptic promoters and disruption of the gene(s) neighboring the promoters. This susceptibility of illegitimate recombination and activation is particularly attributed to the loose packaging of the DNA due to hypomethylation, hence making it more available to misalignment and transcription activities respectively. This may also result in the activation of oncogenes and that of miRNA, also contributing to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Either hypomethylation or hypermethylation can occur at ICRs acn contibute towards a cencer. Taking H19/Igf2 gene cluster as an example, we can understand how hypermethylation at the ICR can lead to a cancer cell. Igf2 gene is and insulin-like growth factor. In a normal cell, the maternal allele is imprinted at the Imprint Control Region (ICR) i.e., it is unmethylated and hence CTCF binds to it. This results in the enhancers to enhance H19 gene expression and blocking of the Igf2 gene expression. On the paternal allele however, the ICR and the following H19 promoter is methylated and hence the H19 gene is silenced. Therefore, the enhancers play their part in allowing and enhancing the transcription of Igf2 gene. As a cumulative effect of the paternal expression and a maternal silencing of Igf2, the growth of the cell is within normal range. On the other hand, in a cancer cell, as a result of hypermethylation at the ICR at both paternal and maternal alleles, Igf2 is overexpressed due to its expression from both paternal and maternal chromosomes. This leads to the overgrowth or uncontrolled growth of the cell, which is one of the features of a cancer cell.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the case of cancer, methylation of DNA by methyltransferases silence the surrounding genes including the tumor suppressor genes and result in the overgrowth of tumors. Decitabine belongs to the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor class of cancer drugs. As the class suggests, it inhibits the methyltransferases and hence a relatively lower methylation ensues in the genome. As a consequence, the tumor suppressor genes are re-activated and result in a substantial reduction in the proliferation of tumors.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation can be passed on to daugther and granddaughter cells therefore these endure from one cell generation to the next. Therefore, drugs the alter DNA methylation in cancer patient can not only do so during the period of treatment but can also leave effects for the upcoming cell generations. However, these drugs are not advisable during the sensitive periods such as the during the primordial germ cell development and gamette formation because during this period, all epigenetic marks are removed and re-placed. Therefore, giving a drug altering methylation can disturb the normal setting-up of epigenetic marks. Moreover, if the drug is a methyltransferase inhibitor, it will prevent the setting-up methylation at all locations in the genome during the sensitive period, resulting in a defective germline cells.</div>
