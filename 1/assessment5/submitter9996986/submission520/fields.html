    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The methylation of cytosine residue in CpG islands involves
in repressing gene transcription, and is critical for normal development. DNA
methylation is associated with X-chromosome inactivation and genomic
imprinting, as well as carcinogenesis. While hypermethylation in the promoter of CpG islands is
associated with gene inactivation, hypomethylation in intergenic regions and
repetitive elements is involved in gene activation. In cancer cells, there are
hypermethylation in the promoter at CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes and hypomethylation
of oncogens. Genome-wide (including intergenic regions and repetitive elements)
hypomethylation is implicated in the development and progression of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Igf2 is paternally expressed while H19 is maternally
expressed.  In the H19/Igf2 cluster, the methylation of the paternal allele was shown at the ICR, and the methylation of the maternal allele was not. The CTCF complex binds to the maternal allele and then the downstream molecules act on H19. The CTCF complex could not bind to the paternal allele because of the methylation, leading to silencing of the H19 gene. When the ICR is hypermethylated, both strands are expressed paternally, leading to a double dose of Igf2 with no dose of H19. This is involved in Wilm's tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine, an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase, contributes to DNA hypomethylation. This is used for treating myelodysplatic syndrome. Decitabine shows an antitumor effect by reactivating tumor suppressor genes which was silenced epigenetically. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is able to be a potential target to treat cancer. Once it treated to patients the effects of drug are mitotically inheritable. However, these intervention may cause systemic interference, especially periods of time where epigenetic reprogramming occurs. Particularly, it would be inadvisable to pregnant women since intensive epigenetic reprogramming happens during early development.</div>
