    <div class="field-value"><p>The changes in methylation in different regions of a genome (CpG
islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements) are discussed below.</p>

<p>In normal cells, methylation
in CpG islands (near transcription site of genes) is typically associated with
silencing of the gene. One way methylation can bring about silencing is by
formation of a condensed chromatin structure. The condensed region of DNA
becomes inaccessible to the transcription factors and the expression of the gene is prevented.</p>

<p><span>In cancer cells, CpG islands are commonly hypermethylation. Methylation of  CpG islands near the promoters of tumor suppressor
genes causes condensing of the DNA into a silent state. </span>Although abnormal
DNA methylation affecting a variety of genes occurs in most of the cancer, some
tumors show aberrant hypermethylation of numerous genes. This is called CpG
island methylator phenotype (CIMP).  CIMP
is characterized by excessive DNMT3b expression and increased DNA
methyltransferase activity, causing abnormal repression of many genes including
tumor suppressor genes. The cells with epimutated tumor suppressor genes are selected. </p>

<p>The sets of genes that are hypermethylated differ from one
cancer type to another. </p>

<p>Normally the intergenic regions and the repetitive
elements tend to be hypermethylated. The methylated state helps to maintain the
genomic stability. Because of the methylation, the chromosome is
heterochromatized so that no illegitimate recombination occurs. </p>

<p>In cancer cells, the intergenic regions and the repetitive
elements will be hypomethylated. The intergenic regions can misalign causing illegitimate
recombination because the chromatin is not densely packed. </p>

<p>Repeats can be activated because of the hypomethylation.
As a result, these repeats can make copies of themselves and transpose. These
repeats may disrupt the neighboring genes or may activate cryptic promoters, both
of which lead to transcriptional aberration of the surrounding regions which may increase the hypomethylation of some genomic regions and thereby lead to increased tumor progression.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>In H19/Igf2 of the paternal allele,  the imprint control region and H19 gene are methylated and thus silent. The enhancers act on the Igf2, allowing its expression in paternal allele.</div><div>In maternal allele, the imprint control region is unmethylated due to which CTF2 binds to the ICR. The enhancers in maternal allele act on H19 allowing its transcription. Igf2 is, however, not expressed. This maintains the expression level of Igf2 in the cell, which is associated with growth. </div><div>Cancer cells display loss of imprinting i.e the genes that should be displaying parent of origin specific expression no longer show imprinted expression.  Hence this altered expression in cancer may involve either expression from both parental alleles or silencing of both parental alleles. </div><div>In Wilm's tumor, Igf2/H19 cluster is methylated in ICR of both the paternal and maternal alleles. As a result, enhancers act on Igf2 allele in both the alleles causing expression of Igf2 but silencing of H19 in both the alleles. As the cell encounters double dose of growth promoting gene Igf2, it might undergo rapid division. </div><div>Alterations in DNA methyation at ICRs can result in loss of expression of growth promoting genes or overexpession of growth promoting gene.</div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent  of DNMT inhibitor class. A DNMT inhibitors are nucleoside analogues, which incorporate into DNA at first then binds irreversibly  to DNMT. The function of DNMT is to methylate the hemimethylated DNA after they are replicated. Failure of DNMT to methylate the DNA after replication results in demethylated daughter cells. </div><div>As cancer cells are rapidly dividing cells, appropriate doses of Decitabine will affect the replication such that methylation cannot be laid down by DNMT in daughter cells. Demethylating action of Decitabine results in anti-neoplastic effects.</div><div><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>DNA methylation maintains gene expression and genomic integrity. Alteration in DNA methylation can result in negative effects like abnormal karyotype, illegitimate recombinations and detrimental transposition of repeats. These changes can result into misexpression of genes which may have harmful effects on the organism.</div><div>In human life cycle, active remodeling of epigenome takes place mainly during pre-implantation to early post-implantation period and during primordial germ cell development. These are the major periods when the epigenome is sensitive to environmental changes. These periods are known as sensitive periods. Tissues/organs may have other sensitive periods during somatic maintenance depending on how it was differentiated. Diets and maternal care during some of these sensitive periods seem to affect the epigenetic state of individuals and their offsprings. The treatment during such periods may result in epigenetic changes that skip the epigenetic remodeling, due to which the epigenetic state of the patients or their offsprings may be affected. Drugs that change DNA methylation when applied during sensitive period s can cause changes in methylation which persist in the tissue/organ. This might lead to unexpected changes in expression that last beyond the period of treatment.</div><div><br /></div></div>
