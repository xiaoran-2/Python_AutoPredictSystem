    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value">In normal cells, CpG islands, which are commonly found in promoter regions, tend to be hypomethylated. In cancer cells, CpG island and island shores are often hypermethylated, particularly in promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes. DNA methylation in of tumor suppressor CpG islands has the effect of silencing tumor suppressor genes in a mitotically heritable manner, allowing the tumor to proliferate. <br /><br />Normally, repetitive elements and intergenic regions are hypermethylated. Heavy methylation (and tight packing as heterochromatin) of repetitive elements promotes genome stability by protecting against illegitimate recombination between repeats, transposition and transcriptional noise from strong promoters often associated with repetitive elements. In cancer, these regions tend to be hypomethylated, which may result in increased genomic instability due to reciprocal translocations, delations, insertions. Without methylation, transposons are more likely to jump around the genome and potentially disrupt gene function.<br /><br />Aberrant DNA methylation in cancer also occurs at imprint control regions (ICRs) and CpG poor promoters. At CpG poor promoters, cancer cells may exhibit hypomethylation, which may lead to gene activation.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">On the paternal alleles, the H19/Igf2 cluster exhibits methylation at the imprint control region (ICR) and at the H19 promoter. ICR methylation prevents CTCF from binding. Together, these effects allow downstream enhancers to access the Igf2 gene, resulting in expression of Igf2 from the paternal allele.<br /><br />On the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated, allowing CTCF to access and bind, which results in enhancer blocking. The downstream enhancers bind to and result in expression of H19 and are unable to reach Igf2, which is not expressed from the maternal allele.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumor, DNA methylation patterns are disrupted so that both alleles exhibit the methylation of the paternal allele. This results in overexpression of Igf2, because the cancerous cell will express Igf2 from both parental alleles. Igf2 is a growth factor; its overexpression thus contributes to tumorigenesis and cancer. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor. It works by acting as a nuceloside analog, which gets incorporated into DNA during replication, and irreversibly binds to DNMT, which prevents DNMT from acting to methylate replicating DNA. Because decitabine is replication dependent, it works against cancer by preferentially targeting cancer cells (although it also affects normal cells at a lower rate), and preventing DNMT from laying down methylation on replicating DNA.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylating can have enduring effects on the epigenome because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, and is generally maintained for the life of the organism (with two exceptions - early development and germ cell development). Thus, once DNA methylation patterns are changed, they will remain in the changed pattern, which will be continued on through cell division. It may be that epigenetic drugs have the effect of permanently altering tumor cells in a way that makes them more susceptible as targets of chemotherapy.<br /><br />It might be best to avoid using such drugs during sensitive periods of early embryonic development and development of primordial germ cells, when cells undergo epigenetic reprogramming (i.e., DNA methylation is cleared and later remethylated). Use of DNMT inhibitors during such sensitive periods could result in permanent, global disruption of the epigenome with potentially lethal effects. Women in early stages of pregnancy might not be good candidates for such therapy. </div>
