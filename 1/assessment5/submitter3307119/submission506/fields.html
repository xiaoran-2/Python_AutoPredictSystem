    <div class="field-value">Normaly DNA methylation doesn't tend to occur at CpG islands, but if you find methylation at the CpG islands is usually silencing of a gene expression.There are two types of DNA methylation abnormalities, locus specific hypermethylation and genome wide DNA hypomethylation. CpG island hypermethylation is used as an alternative to genetic mutation, to silence tumor suppressor genes in cancer. DNA methylation is mitotically heritable so its a very effective way of silencing a tumor suppressor gene, and these epimutations can readily selected for, so if you think that actually silencing a tumor suppressor is gonna allow that particular cell have a competitive advantage over the others in the surrounding tissues, then over a period of time the cells that have these epimutations are more likely to divide more rapidly or to not die as much and therefore they can take over. Tumor suppressor hypermethylation is often more frequent than mutations and identity of hypermethylated CGI's varies by tumor type. As CGI methylation progresses with time, but confounded by DNA methylation alterations increasing with age. The function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements seems to be maintaining genomic integrity and genome defense. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">On the paternal allele when this ICR is methylated, CTCF now can no longer bind so the enhancers are free to act on igf2 and promote its expression from the paternal allele. When this ICR is unmethylated as in the maternal allele, it is bound by a protein called CTCF which is an insulator protein, insulates igf2 from downstream enhancers which are now free to act on H19 and enhance H19's expression on this maternal allele. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the DNA-demethylating agents class. When Dr Dhanak and his colleagues treated lymphoma cells with a newly 
developed inhibitor, currently referred to by the unmemorable name 
GSK2816126, they found that the amount of histone overmethylation 
declined dramatically. And when they treated both cell cultures and 
laboratory animals with GSK2816126, they found it also reduces the 
proliferation of tumour cells while, crucially, having no apparent 
effect on nearby normal cells.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">There are sensitive periods when the environment can influence the epigenetic makeup. The periods that are sensitive are the same as in IVF technologies. Primordial germ cell developement all the way to the production of the mature egg and sperm, also pre-implantation and post-implantation period. Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because the drugs could influence the epigenetic makeup. During the sensitive periods active reprogramming, removng and laying down of the active epigenetic marks of the genome.<br /><br /><strong>References</strong><br />1. Magazine
