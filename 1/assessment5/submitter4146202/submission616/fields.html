    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Normally DNA methylation of CpG islands suppress the underlying gene expression. So, CpG islands is not usually methylated in normal cells.</li><li>In cancer cells there is aberrant hypermethylation of CpG islands. A<span>berrant DNA methylation could arise stochastically due to loss of fidelity or mutation of epigenetic enzymes.</span></li><li>Hypermethylated CpG islands suppress the expression of tumor suppressing genes which is recognized as one of the hits according to Knudson hypothesis.</li><li>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated in normal cells. So, these regions are not expressed in normal cells.</li><li>In cancer cells intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated. This is the earliest sign that occur in every tumor cell.</li><li>Hypomethylation of these regions results in illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoter and disruption of neighbouring genes which in turn causes cancer. Hypomethylation in CpG poor promoters can result in activation of oncogenes.  </li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>In paternal allele Igf2 is normally expressed because here ICR (CTCF) and H19 promoter are methylated. So, enhancers in the underlying genes can not activate the H19 gene but can cause expression of Igf2 gene.</li><li>In maternal allele  Igf2 is normally silenced because here ICR (CTCF) and H19 promoter are  not methylated. So, enhancers in the underlying genes can activate the H19 gene and can not cause expression of Igf2 gene due to CTCF insulator.</li><li>In Wilm's tumor CTCF and promoter of H19 gene become hypermethylated in maternal allele which is usually non methylated.</li><li>Hypermethylation of ICR in maternal allele causes enhancer genes to activate Igf2 gene which is a growth promoting gene. Thus causes tumorogenesis. </li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Decitabine belongs to DNA demethylating agents</li><li>Decitabine inhibits the DNA methyltransferase enzyme that results in demthylation of the DNA in promoters of tumor suppressor genes. </li><li>Decitabine reactivates epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor genes by inhibiting DNA methylatransferase enzyme. <span>More recently, researchers led by Stephen Baylin at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, in Baltimore, have shown that a combination of a histone-deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine slowed tumour growth in some people with advanced lung cancer.</span></li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>DNA methylation is a epigenetic mark that can pass into daughter cells. So, once a cell is affected by DNMTi, it can pass the same effect into it's daughter cells.</li><li>Sensitive period may be defined as the period in the developmental cycle of an embryo when it remain susceptible to environmental or other insult which may alter the epigenetic reprogramming of it's cells. </li><li>Early embryonic period and period of PGC development are sensitive periods of development.</li><li><span>Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable as in this period epigenetic reprogramming occurs. If there is any mistake or alteration happens during this period this may in turn alter the cellular function for the life time.</span></li></ul></div>
