    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark that is involved in the formation of chromatin and the silencing of genes. Most CpG islands are not methylated, but there are some exceptions as in the case of X inactivation in where the inactive X chromosome has CpGs islands methylated. In cancer, CpG islands are often hypermethylated due to mutations in the epigenetic enzymes or loss of fidelity. As DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, cancer cells pass on this epigenetic change in the CpG islands which then accumulated with tumor progression. Generally, hypermethylation at CpG islands is related with silencing of tumor repressive genes, which play roles in the cell cycle, apopotosis and DNA repair, like BRCA1 in breast cancer and MLH1 in colorectal cancer. <br /><br />On the other hand, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated in normal cells. This epigenetic mark is important to maintain genomic integrity or stability. DNA methylation can silence cryptic transcription start sites, cryptic splice sites, or repeats to protect from illegitimate recombination and transposition. Also, it can prevent transcriptional interference between strong promoters. However, cancer cells often show hypomethylation in those sites sometimes due to mutations in DNMT3B as it happens in ICF, an immunodeficiency disease. Thus, hypomethylation makes the genome unstable and prone to transposition, illegitimate recombination, and other changes that may enhance tumorigenesis.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The paternal allele of the H19/lg2 cluster shows DNA methylation in the CTFC binding site, which spreads up to the H19 promoter to silence its expression. Thus, downstream enhancers upregulate the expression of lgf2 located upstream. On the maternal allele, the binding site of CTFC is unmethylated, and thus, CTFC can bind the binding site, allowing the enhancers to act on the H19 promoter as CTFC doesn't allow the enhancers to access lgf2, which is unexpressed or silenced. In some cases, the maternal allele is mutated or deleted, which leads to loss of imprinting and uniparental disonomy, that of the paternal allele. Enhances upregulate lgf2, an oncogene that promotes growth, leading to tumor formation in the kidney in young children.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a demethylating agent and a nucleoside analogue that acts against DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) by irreversibly binding DNMT in a replication-dependent manner. Cancer cells, which replicate much faster than normal cells,  are unable to maintain DNA methylation in CpG islands as they divide, thus activating genes, like tumor repressive genes, which were previously silenced by DNA methylation in cancer cells. By activating those genes and preventing the heritability of DNA methylation in cancer cells, decitabine hinders tumour progression.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Athough DNA methylation is reprogrammed during germ cell development and early development, DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, that is, a cell can pass on the DNA methylation pattern to its daughter cells. Thus, epigenetic drugs that alter DNA methylation can, little by little, change the epigenetic marks in cancer cells without killing the cells. <br /><br />However, these drugs are not advisable during sensitive periods. Sensitive periods are periods of high epigenetic sensitivity, in which changing the environment can influence the epigenetic control. The sensitive periods are the germ cell development, the pre-implantation period, and the early post-implantation period. Thus,  young people in which germ cells are still developing, pregnant women, or men and women planning to have a child soon should not take these drugs as they could affect their germ cells or change the environment in the uterus.<br /><br /></div>
