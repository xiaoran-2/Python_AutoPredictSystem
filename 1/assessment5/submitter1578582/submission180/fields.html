    <div class="field-value">The normal function of methylation at CpG islands is gene silencing; the methyl groups attached prevent the binding of transcriptases.  A key example is X inactivation, which is necessary in mammals so that females will not express the genes the X chromosomes, of which they have 2, excessively.  Typically in normal cells CpG islands are hypomethylated, while CpG sequences elsewhere (in IAPs for example) are hypermethylated.  In cancer, methylation may be increased or decreased at CpG islands, but are usually hypermethylated; either event can change the expression of genes and destabilize the behaviour of the cell.  In cancer, CpG sequences elsewhere tend to be hypomethylated.  When CpG islands are hypermethylated this may silence tumour suppressor genes, leading to cancerous growth.  Hypomethylation elsewhere may lead to deletions, insertions and translocations during transcription; hypermethylation in these areas normally means greater stability, hypomethylation is associated with aberrant behaviour.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the H19/IGF2 cluster on the paternal allele, the Imprint Control Region (ICR) ahead of the H19 gene is methylated blocking the attachment of the CTCF molecule; without the CTCF attached to the ICR, methylation spreads further blocking expression of the H19 gene itself.  On the maternal allele, the ICR is not methylated, allowing the attachment of the CTCF molecule.  The CTCF molecule blocks the action of the 2 enhancer regions past the H19 gene, which on the paternal gene activate IGF2 gene expression, but, being blocked, activate the H19 gene on the maternal allele.  Thus, normally the maternal DNA expresses the H19 gene and the paternal DNA expresses the IGF2 gene.  If the maternal DNA ICR for the H19/IGF2 cluster becomes hypermethylated, however, then the region will resemble the paternal DNA in that region; the cell will have excess growth factor (IGF2) and little or no H19.  This leads to Wilm’s tumour.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Decitabine hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNMT1; it is in the class of DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitors.  Decitabine is licensed for treatment of treating myelodysplatic</div><div>syndrome in which the bone marrow produces deformed blood cells, which leads to acute myelogenous leukemia.  Decitabine’s effect is to allow expression of tumour suppressor genes which have become hypermethylated and thus silenced in the tumour cells.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA epigenetic changes to a cancerous cell would be inherited mitotically by all the cells descendants; thus, if the cells defects could be corrected and the cell normalized, the cancer would be cured at least in that cell line.  The sensitive periods epigenetically are periods of reprogramming, of which there are two early in fetal development, first, when epigenetic marks are globally cleared and then reset, and shortly after, when epigenetic marks are cleared for Primordial Germ Cell development.  Giving a drug to a pregnant woman at these times might have catastrophic effects on the development of the growing fetus.  As there might be an extended time for the drug to clear the body, a woman would not want to become pregnant for several months, perhaps, after taking such drugs.</div>
