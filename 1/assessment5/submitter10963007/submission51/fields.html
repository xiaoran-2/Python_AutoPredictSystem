    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value">Methylation of CpG islands at gene promoters is almost always associated with gene silencing. In general CpG islands tend to be unmethylated, though there are some methylated ones. In cancer there is hypermethylation of CpG islands; this can silence tumor suppression genes. C-G pairs in <span>intergenic regions and repetitive elements are generally methylated but in cancer they are hypomethylated. Unmethylated repeats can can jump around the genome and cause illegitimate recombinations. Demethylation of CpG poor promoters can cause activation of microRNA that targets tumor suppressor genes. Overall genome wide hypomethylation causes genomic instability.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">On the maternal allele the imprint control region is unmethylated, this allows the CTCF insulator protein to bind. CTCF blocks the downstream enhancers from taking effect on Igf2. Alternately, since the enhancers are blocked from acting on Igf2, the enhancers act on H19; so on the maternal allele H19 is active and Igf2 is inactive. On the paternal allele the ICR is methylated making it so that the CTCF cannot bind; the enhancers are then free to act on the Igf2. So on the paternal allele the H19 is inactive and the Igf2 is active. In Wilm's tumor the maternal allele behaves like the paternal allele creating two active copies of Igf2 and two inactive copies of H19. An increased amount of Igf2 may cause stimulation of tumor growth.<br /><br />Sources: <a href="http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/IGF2">http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/IGF2</a></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a "DNA demethylating agent". Decitabine gets incorporated into the DNA upon replication, when the DNMT1 binds to the nucleotide it is bound irreversibly and cannot copy the DNA methylation to the daughter strand. This means that Decitabine is division dependant and since cancer cells are dividing more rapidly than other cells they will be affected most and can undo hypermethylation at CpG islands.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, alterations in DNA methylation will continue until they are actively erased. This makes it so that the effects of alterations in DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome. A sensitive period in epigenetics is a time when epigenetic state is easily altered. The most sensitive epigenetic period is the developmental period so it would be inadvisable to treat pregnant mothers with a DNA methylation altering drug because it may effect their offspring.</div>
