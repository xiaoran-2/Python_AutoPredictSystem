    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is a naturally occuring phenomena where methyl groups being added to DNA bases resulting in a number of alteration of gene expression at different levels. In general, these methylations take place in CpG islands of DNA. Major result of CpG island methylation (hypomethylated) is observed as transcriptional silencing where the genes are shut off. Researches show that in cancer, abnormality in hypermethilation on CpGislands, specifically promoters of genes that are related to cancer development. We can roughly conclude that tumor suppressor genes are to be affected and turned of through this hypermethylation leading to abnormal mass formation. On the other hand, DNA methylation plays a key role in suppressing the affects of the repetitive element and thus increases stability of the genom. THis is believed to be happening as follows: D<span>NA methylation functions as a transcriptional downregulator and stop non specific expression (mostly at transcriptional level) from occuring and accordingly assists keeping genomic stability. In the cases of disrupted control mechanism for this control system, DNA methylation is altered for the genes resulting in cancer. Downregulation of these intergenic regions and repetitive elemens, noncoding DNA sequences, stop them from jumping within the genome and create disruption effects on coding sections of the genome, namely promoters as well as gene sequences. Clearly, an altered DNA methylation, indirectly regulation on transcription, may result in uncontrolled switches across genomic material and cause increase in the genomic instability, which we mean cancer in this situation. </span><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DEcitabine is one of the two epigenetic drugs that are currently on the market. It is a DNA-demethylating agent, DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. It is used in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes which are the precursors of leukemia of a certain type. By blocking the methyl binding, blocked methyltransferase, it demethylates, therefore causes hypomethylation. <br /><span><br />Lack of methyl groups change the tendency of the DNA sequence being expressed. Tumor suppressor genes with disrupted methylation pattern become too active and may lead to cancer. With the help of these hypomethylating agents, formation of these excessive methylation, which makes the suppresor genes much more aggressive in terms of expression, is decreased and genomic stability is retained.</span><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Clearly these epigenetic drugs are much more stable as they incorporate in the genome rather than being an outisde help giving temporary solution. By using this class of drugs, genetic patterns is changed back to "normal" and therefore stability is retained for a much longer period of time. Also inheritability is another positive side of this class of therapeutics. Sensitive periods would be, as suggested in the article, the cases where the epigenetic identitiy of the cells are a<span>ctively erased which means major reprogrammings (for instance early development).</span><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">normally methylation of the paternal allele at ICR is observed which means no methylation for the maternal allele. Methylation prevent the protein complex from accessing to paternal allele. Eventually binding to maternal allele occurs and TFs function on this side of the H19.<br /><br />AS a result normally both H91 and Igf2 are present at regular level. But hypermethylation on ICR makes the paternal allele to be expressed for both cases. Instead of regular level of both Igf2 and H19, thanks to Wilm's tumor, Igf2 is doubled and no amount of H19 is expressed. Overexpression of Igf2 growth-promoter leads to cancer</div>
