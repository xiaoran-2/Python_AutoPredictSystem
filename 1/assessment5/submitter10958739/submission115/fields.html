    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value">In normal cells, CpG islands, which are often found in the promoters of genes, are unmethylated and the underlying gene is active. In cancer cells, however, CpG islands in promoters are often hypermethylated which leads to silencing of the gene controlled by that promoter. Hypermethylation of promoters of tumour suppressor genes that regulate apoptosis, cell cycle or DNA repair leads to their silencing and therefore a cancer cell is more likely to escape death and proliferate further. <br />In normal cells intergenic regions and repetitive elements are generally methylated and silenced. In cancer cells, the opposite is observed where methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is lost and they are hypomethylated. Hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to genomic instability. It could lead to homologous recombination between intergenic regions which could disrupt genes (i.e. tumour suppressor genes could be silenced or oncogenes activated) and cause chromosomal inversions or translocations. In addition, active repetitive elements could transpose to other regions of the genome and silence tumour suppressor genes or activate oncogenes which could contribute to tumour formation.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The imprint control region of H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele. CTCF insulator element binds the unmethylated ICR on the maternal allele thus allowing the downstream enhancers to act on H19 which is then expressed from the maternal allele. Igf2 is insulated by CTCF and is not expressed from the maternal allele. In contrast, CTCF cannot bind the methylated ICR on the paternal allele so the dowstream enhancers can act on Igf2 which becomes expressed by the paternal allele. <br />In Wilm's tumour there is hypermethylation of the imprinting region which leads to the maternal allele also being methylated as the paternal. In this case CTCF cannot bind to the maternal allele neither to the paternal allele so it cannot prevent the enhancers from activating Igf2, therefore Igf2 is expressed from both alleles which leads to double dose of the gene. <br />Igf2 is Insulin-Like Growth factor 2 and is suggested that it promotes growth and proliferation of cells therefore increased production of Igf2 may promote growth and proliferation of tumour cells and prevent cells with DNA damage of being destroyed thus leading to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent that inhibits histone methylation. Decitabine hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferases so the methyl group cannot be transferred to the DNA and it can't be methylated. It could have an anti-tumour effect as it would prevent the hypermethylation of promoter regions of tumour suppressor genes or it would demethylate already hypermethylated and silenced tumour suppressor genes therefore making them active again. Having active tumour suppressor genes would help to kill off any cells with damaged DNA and won't let them proliferate further, therefore it could wither prevent tumour formation or slow down tumour growth preventing methastasis.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark that is inherited through mitotic cell division so the daughter cells would carry the same epigenetic profile as the cell they originated from. Therefore, if the DNA methylation pattern is changed by a drug this new methylation profile would be passed on to daughter cells and maintained during this cell's lifetime. A sensitive period is any period of development when the epigenetic profile is being reset and laid down again. Generally these periods are sensitive to environmental changes so it's possible that the epigenome could be affected by certain chemicals, for example. Two of the defined sensitive periods are during pre-implantation in early embryonic development and during primordial germ cell development when the epigenetic marks are reprogrammed. Therefore, changes in these periods that are likely to affect the next generation are not desirable so probably administering DNA demethylation drugs to women who are in their early days or weeks of the pregnancy would be inadvisable in order to avoid any disturbances of the epigenetic reprogramming which could be passed on to the next generation.</div>
