    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification associated with gene silencing. DNA methylation not only have a gene expression regulatory role inducing repressive chromatin structure and silencing repeats to avoid transcriptional interference, but also it is involved in maintenance of genomic integrity and stability, silencing cryptic splice sites and repeat elements and preventing illegitimate recombination and transposition.<br />In normal cells, CpG islands often situated at promoter regions of genes tend to be unmethylated to permit gene expression. On the other way around, Intergenic regions and specially repetitive elements are usually methylated to maintain genomic stability as mentioned before.<br />In cancer cells, two opposite tendences in terms of methylation are founded: a hypermethylation of CpG islands and a general hypomethylation at intergenic regions and repeatitive elemnts in a genome-wide point of view. Hypermetilation at CpG island at promoter regions of tumour suppressor genes causes silencing of these genes and consequentially can have a role in development of tumours, specially if not only one but multiple set of genes is affected. Hypomethilation of intergenic regions can be associated with the ctivation of oncocgene wich promoters are poor in CpG dinucleotide to be considered a CpG islands (exatly the opposite of the hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes) and hypomethylation of repetitive elements is associated with genomic instability promoting illegitimate recombination between repeats, transposition and activation of cryptic promoters with alteration of expression in sourrounded genes.<br />Considering the multiple hits to DNA Knudson´s hypothesis, each one of those event can be considered an hit that increase the probability of developing cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Genomic imprinting is the monoallelic expression of a gene depending of his parent of origin. Most of imprinted genes are associated with cell growth as for example the oncogene (gene wich expression increase the probability of develop tumous) Igf2.<br />In normal condition, the imprinted control region (ICR) of hte cluster H19/Igf2 in differentially methylated between the maternal and paternal alleles. In the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated and bounded by the insulator protein CTCF that separates the enhancer region from Igf2 gene and consequently the enhancer activate H19 expression and Igf2 gene is not expressed. In the paternal allele, methylation of the ICR prevent the binding of the insulator protein CTCF and the enhancer region activates Igf2 expression.<br />In Wilm´s tumour, a childhood kidney tumour, hypermethylation of ICR in the maternal allele, cause it to behave as the paternal one and the enhancer activates the expression of the oncogene Igf2. Increase in the dose of the growth promoting factor Igf2, now transcribed from both paternal and maternal allele, is the main cause of Wilm´s tumour.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is one of the main alterations in epigenetic modifications seen in cancer but, unlike genetic mutations, is a reversible modification and for this reason a good candidate to study possible therapies in cancer. It´s important to know that epigenetic causes and effects are different in a tumour-specific manner.<br />Decitabine is a FDA approved drug that target epigenetic machinery to treat cancer. It is an inhibitor of <i>de novo</i> methyl transferase (DNMT), proteins involved in DNA methylation. Decitabine, as other DNMT inhibitors, is a nucleoside analogous that irreversibly bind DNMTs. Even if high doses show toxic effects, recent studies show that very low dosis of this drug have an anti-tumour effect doing to DNA demethylation in a replicant dependent way.<br />Unfortunally Decitabine is not a universal cancer drug and actually it is used in the treatment of myelodisplastic syndrome, precurosr of acute myeloid leukemia.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation, as epigenetic modifications, is a mitotically heritable change of epigenetic state. This property make DNA abnormal methylation a possible cause for lifelong effects.<br />A sensitive period is the time during wich exposure to a particular environmental effector can lay down abnormal epigenetic alterations. Those periods are mostly associated with events in epigenetic reprogramming as during germ cells development and early embryonic development till sometic maintenance; many studies show some enviromental effectors can act also during early life till puberty and in the short period around fecundation.<br />Many studies report assumption of substance that slightly interfere with the normal epigenetic reprogramming during sensitive periods can affect life quality and longevity of the progeny for multiple generations and for this reason, treating patients with drugs that aim to alter epigenetic machinary activity is highly inadvisable. Even if often the main concern is to save patient´s life, we can never forget about the life quality and long-term effects.</div>
