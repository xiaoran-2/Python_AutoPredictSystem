    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands (CGI) are fractions of the genome enriched with C+G
bases and that are normally not methylated. Unmethylated CGI are mostly associated to promoters of
active genes and have a functional role in transcriptional activity. The
relaxed conformation of CGI allow transcription factors and chromatin-modifying
enzymes to bind and regulate transcription. Some CGI are found to be methylated on genes silenced during development and in X-inactive
chromosomes. However this hypermethylation seem to be happening after other silencing mechanisms and do not seem to have a direct role in repressing transcription.</p>

<p>Cancer is characterized by hypermethylation of CpG islands. This abnormal epigenetic pattern often happen on promoters of tumour suppressor genes, resulting in transcriptional silencing. Downregulation of tumor suppressor genes which are important for control of cell proliferation is a hallmark of cancer. Hypermethylation of CGI seems to
be tumour-specific and therefore can be used as biomarkers.</p>

<p>Most of the genome is formed by repetitive elements and
intergenic regions that do not code for proteins. To maintain genome integrity,
these regions are normally methylated.</p>

<p>In cancer, there is genome-wide hypomethylation. Loss of
methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements results in activation
of transposable elements, can cause mutations, deletions, inversions and
illegitimate recombination. This abnormal events, termed together genomic
instability, contribute to cancer. For example, gain-of-function mutations on oncogenes can
occur or DNA repair mechanisms can become dysfunctional.</p>

<p>Overall, the role of DNA methylation in cancer is the
resulting activation of oncogenes, silencing of tumour suppressor genes, and
chromosomal instability.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinted genes are commonly involved in growth. Dysregulated imprinting will affect the normal balance between activators and inhibitors of growth, promoting cancer development.</p><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster has an imprinted control region (ICR) located
between the Igf2 and H19 genes, which are regulated by downstream enhancer.
The ICR function as binding site for CTCF, an insulator protein. In the paternal allele the ICR is methylated, preventing CTCF to bind. Under this situation, the enhancer acts on Igf2 and
activates its transcription. Furthermore, the repressive methylation marks are
spread on to the H19 promoter causing its silencing.</p>

<p>In the maternal allele, the ICR is hypomethylated and CTFC
can bind. CTFC disrupt the interaction between the enhancer and the Igf2 gene,
preventing its transcription. In consequence, the enhancer can now interact and activate H19
expression.  </p>

<p>Igf2 promotes growth (oncogene) while H19 restricts
growth (tumour suppressor gene). In Wilm´s syndrome, the ICR is hypermethylated
in both alleles (behaving as patental alleles). Therefore Igf2 is expressed
from both alleles while H19 is not expressed at all. In this
way, loss if imprinting of the H19/Igf2 cluster result in increased growth
promoting signalling, a feature of cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferases and thus acts as hypomethylating agent. Decitabine is a cytosine analogue that during replication can
be incorporated into the DNA instead of cytosine. Because of
its structure, Decitabine cannot be methylated by DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1). When proliferating cells are treated with Decitabine, it will be incorporated in the new synthesized DNA strand preventing DNMT1 to add methyl groups. In this way, throughout several rounds of cell division DNA methylation marks can be completely lost form the cells.</p>

<p>In cancers, promoters of tumor suppressor genes are hypermethylated. Treating
cancerous cells with Decitabine, will promote the removal of the repressive
methyl marks from tumor suppressor genes. By reactivating tumor suppressor
genes, cancer cells can then restore their normal control of cell growth.</p><p>Sources: <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" title="Link: http://www.economist.com/node/21552168">http://www.economist.com/node/21552168</a>,
DNA Methylation and Decitabine (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyWXbNqaCo4" title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyWXbNqaCo4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyWXbNqaCo4</a>)</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic mark that can be
mitotically inherited through the activity of DNMT1. Therefore addition or
removal of DNA methylations by epigenetic drugs can be maintained through cell
division for long time periods.   </p>

<p>Sensitive periods are moments when the epigenetic marks are removed
and reset. During these periods, environmental cues such as drugs or nutrient
availability, can affect the dynamics of the epigenetic machinery and can alter
the way epigenetic marks are established.</p>

<p>Early embryo development and primordial germ cell formation
are sensitive periods. During these periods, the epigenome suffers changes that
allow puripotency and cell differentiation, X-inactivation and imprinting of
parental alleles. Similarly, in early childhood some tissues like the brain or
the immunologic system are still under development and having epigenetic
changes. Epigenetic patterns set at these moments are maintained during the
individual’s life-span and can be passed to subsequent generations.</p><p>Because epigenetic drugs can alter the activity of enzymes in
every cell (not only the tumor), treating pregnant women and children should be
avoided. The use of epigenetic drugs at these stages could result in
developmental abnormalities and predisposition to diseases such as cancer,
obesity, asthma, autism, etc.</p>
