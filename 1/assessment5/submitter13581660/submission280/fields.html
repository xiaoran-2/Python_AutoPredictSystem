    <div class="field-value"><p> In
generally CpG islands are found to be unmethylated in normal cells; however in cancer cells these tend
to be hypermethylated. This hypermethylation of CpG islands is found in almost all kinds of tumours that have ever been studied so far, however different set of CpG islands might be hypermethylated in each particular tumour sub-types. CpG island hypermethylation can either be associated with a specific locus (like gene BRCA 1 resulting in breast cancer) or with multiple sets of genes/CpG islands (in case of Colorectal Cancer, CIMP). In cancer the CpG islands at the promoter sites of tumour suppressor genes are more likely to
be hypermethylated, due to which these tumour suppressor genes are silenced (failed to be
expressed) promoting rapid cell growth and preventing cell death. And, since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, these silenced tumour suppressor genes are passed down to daughter cells very efficiently upon each subsequent cell division, hence resulting
in cancerous cell growth which progresses with time.</p>One of the functions of DNA methylation is to maintain genomic instability, so DNA hypomethylation leads to disruption in this genomic instability. In normal cells intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be silenced
by being heavily methylated and are usually found in the form of heterochromatin. While in cancer cells
they are hypomethylated and more loosely packed which allows them to be expressed. When these repeats and intergenic regions are active and expressed it results in illegitimate recombinations, activation of cryptic
promoters and disruption of other neighboring genes.The euchromatic loose chromosome packaging also allows more interaction among alleles and similar repeats which may result in deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations
of DNA causing cancers.This genome-wide hypomethylation to some extent is also found in almost all tumour types tested, happens early in tumorogenesis and progresses with time.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alterations in methylation
of imprint control regions can result in cancers due to over expression of growth
promoting genes or under expressions of growth restricting genes. Normal cells
show a mono allelic parent of origin specific expression while cancer cell
display loss of this imprinting so they are either expressed from both parental
alleles or silenced from both. It is an early event commonly seen in tumorgenesis in pre-neoplastic tissue.</p>

<p>For example in the case of H19/Igf2 cluster expression (where Igf2 is a growth promoting gene) there is a hypermethylation of ICR resulting in Wilm's Tumor. In normal cells Igf2 is only expressed from one parental allele, while in cancer cells its expressed from both parental alleles resulting in excessive cell growth. In normal cells the ICR on paternal
allele is imprinted/methylated allowing enhancers to act on Igf2 gene, and on maternal allele
this ICR is non-imprinted/unmethylated so an insulator (CTCF) binds to it causing the
enhancers to act upon H19 gene instead of Igf2. While in cancer cells due to loss of imprinting these ICRs are hypermethylated on
both the alleles which over expresses this growth promoting Igf2 gene from both the alleles resulting in double dosage of Igf2.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA
de-methylating agent (DNMTi). Because of its anti-neoplastic effects its an FDA
approved drug in US to treat myelodysplastic syndrome, a malignancy of blood, which has progressed to acute myelogenous leukaemia. It functions as
nucleoside analogue, that it incorporates itself into the DNA
strand upon replication and then during cell division when DNMT-1 comes to bind that nucleotide to pass down methylation to daughter strand, it binds
irreversibly and can no longer be released. This causes de-methylation and reduction in tumorigenicity upon each subsequent division. Its a cell
division dependent mechanism and therefore is quite effective as it mostly acts
on these rapidly dividing cancers cells. This division dependent mode of Decitabine also makes it
well tolerable (when taken in lower doses) for cancer patients and causes fewer side
effects as it doesn't effect their normal cells much as they are dividing at a much lower rate. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable its
consequences are long term as they are passed down upon each subsequent cell division with the help of DNMT1. Sensitive periods in the life time of
an organism are the cellular stages where DNA is most sensitive to
environmental, maternal care or epigenomic alterations which may result is
enduring effects on their epigenome and future generations. Two of the most sensitive periods
studied in an organisms’ life time are the pre-implantation phase of an embryo
and the primordial germ cell development, as at these stages previous
epigenetic marks are being released and new set of marks are being laid down. The
paternal and maternal genome is reset during both the periods but the imprinted genes are reset during primordial germ cell development only.There is also some evidence of transgenerational
epigenetic inheritance through the gametes according to Overkalix studies which shows some correlation of increased paternal grandparental food supply with the reduced longevity of their grandchildren. And hence its not advisable to treat patients during these
sensitive time periods with epigenome altering drugs/treatments as this may
disrupt their natural epigenetic programming which may lead to long term
consequences for themselves and their future generations. </p></div>
