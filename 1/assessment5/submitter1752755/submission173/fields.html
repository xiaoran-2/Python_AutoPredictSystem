    <div class="field-value">The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG island is to silence genes. In cancer cells there's an overall, genome wide, hypomethylation but regional hypermethylation, at CpG islands and they can contribute to cancer by silencing tumor suppressor genes. This is an important part of the oncogenic process, together with a mutation in the expression of an oncogene. CpG methylation is stable and mitotically heritable,  Another feature is the hypomethylation of intergenic genes and repetitive elements. The latter is the most relevant with regard to the oncogenesis. In fact, DNA methylation is involved in mantaining the genome stability and hypomethylation of repetitive elements leads to genomic instabilty and a greater risk of genomic mutations, such as gene deletions, translocations or insertions. Genome recombinations are also due to the high similarity among parts of the genome. Hypomethylated repetitive elements can also activate neighbouring genes</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The ICR (Imprinting control region) is hypermethylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele. This means that, on the maternal allele the enhancers will act on H19 and bind to the insulator protein CTCF and block the promoter. As a result, on the maternal allele, Igf2 gene is silenced. On the other side, on the paternal allele, since the ICR is hypermethylated, this inhibits CTCF binding so that the enhancer can interact with Igf2. In the Wilm's tumor the loss of imprinting  of the IGF2 gene  is a common epigenetic alteration (of course it can be also a genetic loss), so;the maternal allele gets methylated, which doubles the expression of IGF-2. IGF-2 is a growth factor and it is associated with Wilm's tumour, a kidney tumour that affects young children. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a demethylating agent. It belongs to DNMT inhibitors, it'a a FDA approved drug (one of the approved drugs that target the epigenetic machinery and one of the two approved for the Myelodysplasic syndrome progressed to AML-acute myelogenous leukaemia). DNMT inhibitors irreversibly bind to DNMT during cell division, getting incorporated into DNA during DNA replication. Decitabine is a nucleoside analog, it acts as a sobstitute of the cytosine component at the CpG nucleotide (target for DNMT), inhibiting DNA methylation. This can lead to re-expression of the tumor suppressor genes. Since replication is essential for DNMT inhibitors to work, and since tumor cells replicates at much higher rates then normal cells, this drugs affects much more the tumor cells. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effect on the epigenome simply because they are very stable (<span>strong covalent carbon-to-carbon bonds that connect cytosine to the methyl group)</span> and hereditable. This concept leads to a special care when it comes to patients in "sensitive periods", like young patients, with developing germ cells or patients with cells in "epigenetic reprogramming" (pre-implantation development). Since all cells are affected by these drugs, treating these patient could interfear with normal reprogramming and development and have serious consequences on the patient itself and/or the offspring.</div>
