    <h1>Submission 254 from Anon (session_user_id: ccd99548ef3a82c1e12990fa48ead920dab64eef)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to DNMTi (DNA de novo methyltransferase inhibitors) of the epigenetic inhibitor family. Decitabine works as DNA-demethylating agents, and it has an anti-tumor effect by treating myelodysplastic syndromes, which are the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML), and Decitabine is already approved by FDA for this particular anti-tumor effect.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation almost exclusively occurs at CpG dinucleotides in mammals. These CpGs clustered into CpG islands, often at promoters of genes. Normally, CpG islands tends to be protected from methylation, since methylation of CpG islands often leads to silencing of the corresponding genes. A small subset of CpG islands that are dynamically methlyated between cell types, also, methylated CpG islands showed up in inactive X chromosomes. However in cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene expression, and these genes are often tumor suppressor genes with the functions of controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair. <br /><br />On the other hand, intergenic regions and repetitive elements of the genome are usually hypermethylated, as to maintain genomic stability, e.g. silence cryptic transcription start cites or cryptic splice sites in the case of intergenic regions, and silence of the repeat elements to prevent transposition, transcriptional interference or illegitimate recombination. In cancer, genome-wide hypomethylation is always found and thus often recognized as one of the hallmarks of cancer, and disruption of these regions contributes to cancer by increasing genomic instability.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Genomic imprinting refers to parent-of-origin specific expression, i.e. only one of the two parental alleles is expressed, and imprinting is closely associated with DNA methylation at the ICR (imprint control region).<br />In the case of H19/Igf2, normally it is paternally imprinted, i.e. the ICR of this cluster on the paternal allele is methylated, thus blocks the binding of insulator protein CTCF, without CTCF, the enhancers downstream can access <i>Igf2 </i>and activate its expression. While on the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated thus allowing CTCF binding, as a consequence, enhancer binding of <i>Igf2</i> is therefore blocked thus <i>Igf2</i> is unable to be expressed.<br /><br />Alterations in DNA methylation at ICRs, either hypo or hyper-methylation, can result in loss of imprinting, since a lot of imprinted genes are associated with growth, this will contribute to cancer development by overexpressing growth promoting genes. Specifically, Wilm's tumor occurs in kidney during childhood due to irregular hypermethylation of the ICR of the maternal allele, which initiates the activation of Igf2 expression by downstream enhancer, with maternal allele behaving just like its paternal counterpart, overdose of the growth promoting protein Igf2 therefore contribute to this cancerous state.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because epigenetic alterations are mitotically heritable and reversible, i.e., <span>epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. However, there are indeed sensitive periods of development when treating patients with these drugs would be inadvisable. These so-called sensitive periods are times when altered environments have an effect on epigenetic control. There are two major sensitive periods: one from primordial germ cell development to the production of gametes, while the second is preimplantation and early post-implantation period. Both are times accompanied by active remodeling of the whole epigenome when epigenetic marks are being cleared or laying down. Besides, there are also brief windows when particular organs will have a sensitive period as well, depending on how that organ develops. Treating patients during these periods will likely to disrupt epigenetic programming and are probable to have huge detrimental effects which might be genetically and/or epigenetically heritable, therefore it would be inadvisable to do so.</span><br /></div>
