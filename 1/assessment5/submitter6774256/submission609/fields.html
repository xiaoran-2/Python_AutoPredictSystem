    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>DNA methylation is one of the epigenetic mechanism by which the cell can control gene expression. CpG islands are normally unmethylated but they become methylated to silence the gene expression through either condensing the chromatin and prevent the gene accessibility or <span>prohibit transcription factor binding and thus, alter gene<br />expression</span>. <br /></li><li>In cancer, CpG islands become hypermethylated and this leads to silencing of tumor suppressor genes that lead eventually to the development of cancer. <br /></li><li>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements happens to maintain genomic integrity. It silences the repeats to prevent transpositions and transcriptional interference from other promoters. It also, prevents 
Illegitimate recombination.</li><li>In cancer, these regions become hypomethylated.</li><li><span>In cancer, this hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements leads genomic instability. It activates promoters of other genes and activates transposition. Also, 
<span>Illegitimate recombination between repeats can occur.<br /><br /></span></span></li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>In the paternal allele, DNA is methylated in the intergenic region and in H19 and this allows enhancers to activate the normal expression of igf2.<br /></li><li>In maternal allele, there is no DNA methylation in the intergenic region and in H19, so, CTCF protein can bind to this region and  act to activate expression of  H19.<br /></li><li>In Wilm’s tumour, both the paternal and maternal alleles are methylated in the intergenic region and in H19, this leads to the overexpression of igf2 ( a growth promoting gene) and the silencing of H19 (a 
<span>growth<br />restricting gene</span>).</li><li>This disruption of imprinting through the overexpression of igf2 and silencing of H19 leads to cancer development.</li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>It is a  DNA-demethylating inhibitor.<br /></li><li>It will decrease the DNA methylation. <br /></li><li>DNA hypermethylation in cancer silences tumor suppressor genes, that control cell growth, and this inhibitor by decreasing the DNA methylation will retain the expression and activity of these genes and thus treat cancer.<br /></li></ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Altering DNA methylation during sensitive periods where removal and re-establishing of epigenetic marks will affect the epigenome because epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable.<br /></li><li>A sensitive period is a period of epigenetic reprogramming where removal and re-establishing of epigenetic marks occur.<br /></li><li>sensitive periods of development are Early development period e.g blastocyst and PGC (primordial germ cell) and GC development period primordial germ cell.<br /></li><li>It is not advisable to treat patients during sensitive periods because epigenetic reprogramming occurs during these periods and the epigenetic marks are changed during these periods, so, you can not rely in your treatment on these epigenetic marks like in this case of the response to chemotherapy after epigenetic alterations. If this happens during sensitive periods these epigenetic marks will be changed and you will find the chemotherapy not effective.</li></ul><br /><br /></div>
