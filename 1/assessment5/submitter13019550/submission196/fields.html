    <div class="field-value">In healthy cells <strong>DNA methylation occurs mainly at intergenic regions and repetitive elements</strong>, while clusters of CpG, called <strong>CpG islands, are in general hypomethylated</strong>. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are remnants of viral and bacterial DNA in our genome. Repetitive elements are CpG rich and thus they are strong promoters. Additionally they can easily transpose. To control intergenic regions and repetitive elements, these parts of the DNA are methylated, thereby maintaining genomic integrity.<br />CpG islands are often located in gene promoters. Methylation of CpG islands results in silencing of gene expression and is rarely seen in normal cells. The inactivated X chromosome in females is an exception, the CpG islands on this chromosome are almost all hypermethylated to fully silence the genes on this chromosome in this and all daughter cells. <br /><br />However, <strong>in cancer cells </strong>the DNA methylation status is reversed. In correlation with tumour progression and tumourigenesis, <strong>CpG islands are hypermethylated while intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated</strong>. This results in gene silencing and decreased genomic stability. Hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes is frequently observed in tumour tissue since mitotically heritable epimutations that cause rapid dividing cells will quicly be selected. Single gene CpG island hypermethylation can sometimes be used as a biomarker to detect a specific type of cancer.<br />Genome-wide hypomethylation at repetitive elements and intergenic regions may result in genomic instability due to several events: 1) recombination between repeats; 2) deletions &amp; insertions; 3) activation of repeats leading to transposition; 4) activation of cryptic promoters and changing expression of neighbouring genes.<br />Concluding, the consequences of DNA hyper- and hypomethylation changes for cancer depends on whether the tumour is dependent on e.g. tumour suppressor silencing (hypermethylation) or chromosomal instability (hypomethylation). </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Hyper of hypomethylation of imprinted genes (parent-of-origin specific gene expression) can result in loss of imprinting. Imprinted genes are often involved in growth. <br />The imprint control region (<strong>ICR</strong>) <strong>of the maternal H19/Igf2 cluster is, unlike the paternal cluster, unmethylated</strong>. This results in CTCF binding: CTCF protects against expression of upstream Igf2 by downstream enhancers, which then act on H19 instead by DNA. However, CTCF cannot bind the methylated paternal ICR, therefore the enhancers act on Igf2, increasing Igf2 expression of the paternal allele. H19 is not expressed on the paternal allele due to spreading of ICR methylation to the H19 CpG island promoter, thereby silencing it.<br /><br />In <strong>Wilm's tumour</strong> the ICR of both alleles is hypermethylated and the maternal allele will therefore act as a paternal allele, causing overexpression of Igf2. Igf2 expression is stimulated by the enhancers of the cluster, while H19 is not expressed. Considering Igf2 is growth promoting and thus an oncogene, overexpression may lead to overgrowth of the affected cells and hence tumour formation.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><b>Decitabine </b>is a drug that targets the epigenetic machinery. It's an <b>inhibitor of DNA methylation</b>, thereby upon division resulting in <b>demethylation </b>of the daughter cell genome compared to the parental cell. Some DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) inhibitors are nucleoside analogues that get build into the DNA and act by irreversibly binding the passing DNMT. Cancer cells are effected more than normal cells because they replicate more often. Consequently, demethylation of gene promoters causes reexpression of the before silenced gene. In case of some epigenetic DNMT inhibitors this demethylation can be gene specific. If this reexpressed gene is involved in tumour suppression, reexpression will result in <b>anti-tumour effects</b> such as less rapid cell division, inhibition of metastasis, or apoptosis of the tumour cell.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Altered DNA methylation with epigenetic drugs, e.g. removed or restored DNA methylation, will be passed on to its daughter cells because the DNA methylation state is <strong>mitotically stably inherited</strong>. This is accomplished by the enzyme <strong>DNMT1 </strong>which binds hemi-methylated DNA upon DNA duplication and then methylates the other strand. <br />Epigenetic sensitive periods of development are periods when epigenetic marks are removed and new marks are layed down on the genome. Specifically sensitive periods are <strong>early development</strong> and primordial germ cell (<strong>PGC</strong>) <strong>development</strong>. Early development comprises the stage from the fertilized egg to the epiblast stage, when most epigenetic marks are removed and new ones are established such as X-inactivation, and marks necessary for cell differentiation. During PGC development either paternal or maternal imprinting is established.<br />If patients were treated with epigenetic drugs during one of these sensitive periods, removing and laying down epigenetic marks could be disturbed. Disturbing gene expression with this <strong>abnormal epigenetic state</strong> might induce diseases, including cancer.</div>
