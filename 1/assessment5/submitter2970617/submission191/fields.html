    <div class="field-value">The normal function of DNA methylation at the CpG islands depends on the CpG island location. If CpG island happens to be at the promoter region, then hypermethylation of the CpG island associates with silencing of the nearby gene. However hypomethylation of promoter's CpG island may indicate expression of the gene in close proximity but does not always predict active transcription of that gene. On the other hand CpG island in imprint control region could be the binding site of the insulator protein that blocks the access of enhancer element to the promoter. Methylated CpG island in this situation blocks the insulator protein binding. In cancer, global methylation of CpG islands is lower relative to normal cells. However restricting the analysis of CpG islands to promoters, gene bodies, and intergenic regions shows hypermethylation of promoters and hypomethylation of gene bodies and intergenic regions. In cancer, the feature of promoter's hypermethylation is particularly associated with tumour suppressor genes which results in their decreased expression. On the other hand the fact that intergenic regions and repetitive elements are not well methylated usually results in chromosomal aberrations such as translocations and unnecessary homologous recombinations. Thus the normal function of CpG methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to prevent these chromosomal abnormalities that contribute to cancer often by disrupting proto-oncogene that is turned into oncogene.     <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">One of the main features of cancer is the loss of imprinting, meaning genes that ought to display monoallelic expression in a parent-of-origin specific way are either expressed from both alleles or silenced at both alleles. The type of alterations of methylation at imprint control region (ICR) can be either enhanced methylation or diminished methylation at these control regions depending on the function of affected genes. For example at the H19/Igf2 cluster the maternal allele is un-methylated while the paternal allele is methylated. Therefore on the maternal chromosome the insulator protein CTCF can bind onto ICR blocking the access of enhancer elements to the promoter of Igf2 which is thus silenced. On the other hand due to the methylation of paternal allele CTCF binding is blocked and hence enhancers can reach the promoter of Igf2, promoting its expression. In case of Wilm's tumour both the maternal and paternal alleles are methylated resulting in complete loss of CTCF binding on both parental chromosomes and doubled dose of Igf2 expression. Because Igf2 is growth promoting, increased expression of Igf2 results in increased proliferation of affected cells and in consequence ensuing of cellular neoplasia.   <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is one of the recently developed drugs to treat a kind of blood cancer called myelodysplastic syndrome which is a precursor for acute myelogenous leukaemia. This drug is an epigenetic modifier and belongs to the class of DNA demethylases. DNA demethylases are capable of actively removing methylated DNA nucleotides at the CpG residues. Once removed (i.e. demethylated), the change is "remembered" by the cell due to mitotic heritability of methylated DNA. It is thought that in cancer cells the methylation at CpG islands at the promoter's of tumour suppressor genes is enhanced relative to the normal physiological condition. Therefore the prime anti-tumour effect of decitabine is caused by the removal of DNA methylation mark at these genes, thus ensuing their expression which reduces their proliferative potential.    <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark that is mitotically heritable. That means that a specific genome-wide pattern of DNA methylation in a particular cell is passed to the progeny of that cell following its cell division. The primary enzyme responsible for this function is DNMT1 which is a enzyme with an affinity for hemi-methylated DNA. Hemi-methylated DNA is a DNA when the parental strand is methylated and daughter strand is not methylated. These sites can be "seen" by DNMT1 which then actively adds a methyl group to the un-methylated daughter strand. Therefore altering DNA methylation can have a long lasting effects on the epigenome as all the cells with this epigenetic modification will have this modification passed to subsequent generations of cells. Patterns of DNA methylation are established at the course of embryological development during periods called sensitive periods. It is not advisable to treat patients with enzymes interfering with DNA methylation during sensitive periods because there is a high possibility of introducing deleterious heritable epi-mutations that will affect the fetus or even an adult derived from that fetus in an unknown way. The sensitive periods of DNA methylation are at the blastocyst stage and during primordial germ cell development.        <br /></div>
