    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is one of the most studied
epigenetic mark. Easy to detect in the laboratory, in the last few decades
study of DNA methylation throughout the genome has allowed to uncover various
and important aspects of the epigenetic machinery. DNA methylation is a
silencing mark, whose effect on gene function is context dependent. In normal
cells, DNA methylation is absent in CpGs islands while present in intergenic
regions and repetitive elements. <br /></p><p>CpGs islands are regions of the genome with
high frequency of the CG nucleotides. These regions are usually
unmethylated to allow gene transcriptions. Nevertheless, in cancer cells, abnormal
hypermethylation of the CpG islands has been found. The hypermethylation of
CpGs leads to chromatin packing in heterochromatin, where genes are shielded
from the transcriptional machinery, and silencing of tumour suppressor genes
occurs. Hypermethylation of CpG islands differs between tumour types and
increases with tumorogenesis. </p>



<p>In the intergenic regions and repeats,
which are the major components of the genome, the opposite occurs. In normal
cells, intergenic regions and repeats are methylated while in cancer cells they
are found to be hypomethylated. Although hypomethylation outcomes change
according to the regions, overall, reduced presence of methyl silencing marks can activate
unwanted transposition, recombination, activation of cryptic promoters and
disruption to neighboring genes, all actions that lead to genomic instability.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Genome imprinting refers to regions regulated by a ICR, imprint control region. When the ICR on the paternal allele is methylated, the gene is paternally imprinted. If the ICR is methylated on the maternal allele, the gene is maternally imprinted. The outcome of the ICR methylation is though different depending on the imprinted cluster. <br />H19/Igf2 is a well studied example of imprinted region. H19/Igf2 cluster is paternally imprinted and includes the Igf2 gene, a ICR, a gene for the
long non-coding (lnc) RNA H19 and two enhancers. When the ICR  is methylated, the
insulator protein CTCF can not bind to the ICR, the methylation spreads from
the ICR to the neighbouring downstream H19 gene, now silenced, and the
enhancers  act upon the Igf2 gene. On the maternal allele, instead, ICR is not
methylated. The CTCF insulator protein binds to ICR and the
enhancers act on the H19 gene.

<p>In Wilm's tumour, ICR is methylated on both
alleles, and they both act as paternal alleles. Cells
affected by Wilm's tumour are characterized by an overexpression of the
Igf2 gene which, being a growth promoting factor, leads to
an excessive cell growth and tumour formation.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the last few decades, with the development of epigenetics and the discovery
that only 2% of the entire genome codes for proteins, cancer has been
rethought from being an exclusive genetic disease to the result of genetic and
epigenetic aberrations. Epigenetic marks, opposite to genetic modifications,
are reversible and therefore much more susceptible to chemical intervention.
One of the few FDA approved epigenetic drugs is the Decitabine, which belongs to
the class of DNMT inhibitors (DNMTi). Decitabine targets DNA methyltransferase activity
by blocking its action during cell division through nucleotide substitution. During
mitosis, DNMT binds irreversibly to the substituted nucleotide, stopping the
addition of methyl group on the daughter strand. The fast replication rate of
tumour cells allows DNMTi to have a bigger impact on neoplastic cells
compared to normal cells. DNMTi have also shown highest effect at low concentration, resulting in a decreased toxicity for the patients.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is a mitotically inheritable mark achieved by the
enzymatic action of the DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), which adds methyl
groups on daughter strands during cell division. In tumours, drugs that work as
DNMT inhibitors (DNMTi) contrast DNMT1 action by blocking the addition of new
methyl groups on daughter strands. The new epigenetic pattern, that has been
established by using DNMTi, is now passed on and will be maintained during the
following cell divisions. For this reason, the effect of these drugs goes
beyond the treatment period. <br /><p>
Nevertheless, since these drugs alter the epigenetic methylation marks of
certain genes, use of DNMTi drugs during sensitive periods, when the
methylation pattern is still not fully established, should be avoided. Sensitive
periods are the two periods of epigenetic reprogramming, pre-implantation
period and primordial germ cell development, as well as life stages when germ
cells are still developing, 9-12 years old for boys and 8-10 years old for
girls. Drugs acting in these periods might indeed lead to unwanted and
damaging epigenetic modifications. </p>
