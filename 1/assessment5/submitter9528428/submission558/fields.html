    <div class="field-value">In cancer, genome-wide DNA methylation decreases, but DNA methylation at CpG islands increases. More specifically, hypermethylation at CpG islands causes tumor suppressor genes to be inactivated, and hypomethylation at ICRs, oncogenes, transposable elements, intergenic regions, and repetitive elements causes disruption of imprinting, genomic instability (deletions, insertions, reciprocal translocations), etc. <br /><br />First, the CpG islands. CpG islands are simply regions saturated with Cytosine-Guanine basepairs, usually found at or near a promoter region. When methylated by DNA methyltransferases, transcription factors/enhancers/etc. no longer bind to the promoter region. Thus, RNA polymerase III is blocked from transcribing the gene, and, effectively, the gene is silenced. Methylation marks at these CpG islands also aid DNA pol III and its associated proteins in distinguishing the 'old' strand from the newly synthesized strand; thus, methylation at CpG islands aids in genomic stability - hence in passing down genomic mutations that have already been established. In cancer, hypermethylation of these CpG islands causes inactivation of tumor suppressor genes - genes that, when transcribed, code for enzymes and proteins that aid in growth cycle regulation, DNA 'mistake finding' machinery, etc.  <br /><br />Intergenic regions and repetitive elements, on the other hand, are usually heavily methylated. Intergenic regions - which contain repetitive elements [A.K.A. transposable elements] and the like - if unmethylated, can 'jump around' in the genome (hence the term 'transposable element') as they code for self-replication and insertion of additional copies of the transposable element in the genome. Thus, if unmethylated, transposable/repetitive elements found in the intergenic regions can wreak havoc both on genomic stability and disrupt normal gene expression of the cell. In cancer, hypomethylation of these repeats means that transposable elements are activated. Worse yet, oncogenes - genes that, when activated, degrade the cell into the later stages of cancer - found in intergenic regions are activated by hypomethylation of CpG islands. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The imprint control region upstream from H19's promoter and the CpG island around its promoter is usually hypomethylated in the maternal allele, thereby causing CTCF to bind to the ICR and causing the enhancers to act on H19, not Igf2. Because the enhancers act on H19, we do not see expression of Igf2. In the paternal allele, the opposite happens: the ICR is hypermethylated and the CpG islands around the H19 promoter are methylated as well; thus, CTCF does not bind to the ICR and the enhancers work on Igf2 (a growth factor). In Wilm's tumour, hypermethylation of the ICR on both alleles causes an increase in the concentration of the growth factor produced by transcription of Igf2, and hence contributes to one of the hallmarks of cancer: rapid, out-of-control growth. Basically, this disruption of imprinting causes the cell to receive two times the normal amount of Igf2 (the growth factor) and no H19 product. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, acts to prevent hypermethylation of DNA. Thus, it indirectly causes DNA to become less heavily methylated - and to become hypomethylated. More specifically, Decitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes - a bone marrow disorder where not enough blood cells are produced (both red and white blood cells), leading to cytopenia (low red/white blood cell counts) - which is a precursor to acute myelogenous leukaemia, perhaps due to the fact that in myelodysplastic syndromes, the bone marrow production of blood is irregular, so <span>myeloblasts (immature white blood cells that develop into cancer cells) can form easily</span>. Decitabine has an anti-tumor effect in that it reactivates tumor suppressor genes (that would previously have been hypermethylated near their promoters at the CpG islands), and thus encourages the formation of protein products that help in regulating the cell's growth cycle, genome, etc. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable - that is, parent cells pass the methyl marks on their genome on to their daughter cells because DNA methyltransferase acts on newly synthesized DNA strands to pass on the methyl marks from the parent strand - drugs that alter DNA methylation patterns have long-lasting effects. Once the DNA methylation patterns are changed, all of the changed cells' progeny will receive these same marks; thus, the patient will keep those DNA methylation marks for the rest of his/her lifetime, assuming further medication/outside influences don't change the epigenetic markers. However, there are 'sensitive periods' of development, where the cells in the patient go through extensive epigenetic programming - that is, many epigenetic marks are cleared and then reset - and to interfere with the patient at this time would be inadvisable, as the cell may already be severely hypomethylated (that is, many of the epigenetic marks have been cleared) and giving medication to hypomethylate the patient's cells more could cause transposable elements to be activated. Additionally, giving medication to hypermethylate the patient's cells might silence genes that ought not be silenced. Sensitive periods include fetal development (so don't give it to pregnant mothers) and periods of gamete formation. </div>
