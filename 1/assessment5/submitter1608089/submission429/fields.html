    <div class="field-value">Normally, DNA is not methylated at CpG islands, which are often located near gene promoters, thus allowing gene expression to occur. Contrary to that, repetative elements and intergenic sequenes are usually methylated. In cancer, however, promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, causing silencing of the gene. Such transcriptional silencing of critical growth regulators, e.g tumor suppressor genes, plays an important role in cancer. Promoter hypermethylation can be the initial hit in many somatic cancers, with subsequent mutations or deletions eliminating the second gene copy. In contrast, the hypomethylation of CpG sites has been associated with the over-expression of oncogenes within cancer cells. Loss of DNA methylation in repetitive sequences might account for most of the global hypomethylation that characterizes a large percentage of human cancers that have been studied.  As for repetitive regions, their hypermethylation is linked to a greater genomic stability, so hypomethylation during cancer leads
to copying errors i.e deletions, duplications etc.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The ICR of H19/Igf2 cluster is unmethylated on the
maternal allele, while the ICR
on the paternal allele is methylated, which means that H19 is expressed only from maternal allele and Igf2 - from paternal. The CTCF complex binds to the allele on the
maternal strand and the downstream enhancers act on H19 as a result. The CTCF complex
does not bind to the paternal allele due to the methyl marks, which leads to silencing of the H19
gene as the enhancers instead drive expression of Igf2. So, when ICR becomes hypermethylated, both strands appear to be of paternal origin and get
expressed as such. <span>In tumors with loss of imprinting, the maternal chromosome reverses to a paternal epigenotype, with a paternal pattern of methylation of the H19 promoter, IGF2 turned on, and H19 turned off, causing increased cell growth. Loss of iprinting of H19 on the maternal chromosome, when it occurs, could occur independently or could be influenced by events in the paternal chromosome.</span><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, which reduces the global levels of 5-methylcytosine. It belongs to a class of  DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. In cancer cells, global hypomethylation is accompanied by hypermethylated and transcriptionally silenced tumor suppressor genes. These  epimutations contribute to the loss of proliferation control in cancer cells. The maintenance of hypermethylation-induced epimutations requires the continuous activity of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) during cell division. Thus, inhibition of DNMTs can be used in epigenetic cancer therapy to reverse epimutations and to reactivate epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor genes. Subsequently, the effect of decitabine can be linked to reactivation of epigenetically silenced tumor supressor genes, induced by the
hypothemylation.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In epigenetic sense, sensitive periods of development are those happening in utero - on the blastocyst stage, when the main amount of epigenetic marks is reestablished, and at the time presursor germ cells are formed. Consequently,  it would be inadvisable to
prescribe such treatments to pregnant mothers (including a few months before conception) as
a lot of reprogramming happens in early child development as well as during the formation of
gametes. Altering DNA methylation can have enducing effects on epigenome because enduring effects are ensured as the DNA methyltransferase
enzymes preserve methyl marks during mitosis.</div>
