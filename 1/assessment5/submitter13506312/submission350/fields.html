    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands
are found in promoter regions. They are usually not methylated in normal cells,
keeping the expression of the corresponding genes in an active state. On the
contrary, CpG islands in cancer cells tend to be methylated, thus resulting in
silencing of the gene expression. This bears consequences, especially when it
regards tumour suppressor genes (genes invoved in the regulation of cell cycle,
proliferation and apoptosis); silencing of the expression of such genes results
to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis of these cells, which
contributes to the development of cancer.</p>

<p><span>Intergenic
regions and repetitive elements, on the other hand, are methylated in normal
cells, but hypomethylated in cancer cells. This leads to genomic instability,
because these repetitive regions can become activated and transpose to neighbouring
parts of the chromosome, potentially causing disruption of the expression of
the genes in these parts of the chromosome, or activation of their expression
(if this transposition activates the promoter of the gene). Such phenomena
could lead e.g. to the activation of oncogenes, or inactivation of tumour
suppressor genes, contributing to the development of cancer.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprint
control region of the H19/Igf2 cluster is normally methylated in the patermal
allele. Thus, the enhancers are able to act on the Igf2 promoter, resulting to
expression of the Igf2 gene. On the contrary, the imprint control region of
this cluster is unmethylated in the maternal allele; therefore the enhancers
are unable to act on the Igf2 gene (because CTCF binds on the imprint control
region in this case), but act on the H19 gene instead, so there is normally no
expression of the Igf2 gene on the maternal allele. In Wilm’s tumour, the
maternal allele is also methylated, resulting to expression of the Igf2 gene in
the maternal allele as well. This leads to double dose of Igf2 expression
compared to normal cells. Igf2 is a growth promoter, and its overexpression can
lead to enhanced proliferation, contributing to the development of cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is
a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor. It is a nucleoside analog, which is
incorporated into the DNA during DNA replication, but when DNMT binds on it, it
is bound irreversibly.</p>

<p>Therefore,
Decitabine acts during replication (is replication dependent), and cancer
cells, which proliferate much more rapidly than normal cells, are more severely
affected by this drug. With its action DNMT is removed, which has an
anti-tumor effect in types of cancer caused by hypermethylation in certain
regions</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA
methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome, because epigenetic
changes are not restricted to the cells affected, but are passed to the
daughters, granddaughters of these cells etc., during cell replication. It
would be inadvisable to do something like that during the so-called sensitive
periods, that is periods where there is active reprogramming of the epigenome.
Such periods are the early embryonic development period (pre-implantation and
early post-implantation period), and during primordial germ cell development (up
to the formation of mature egg or sperm cells); both are periods of active
epigenetic remodeling and establishment of epigenetic marks. Treating patients
with epigenetic drugs during such periods would result to extensive alterations
of the epigenome, with consequences and side effects potentially very serious,
and perhaps not even fully predictable.</p>
