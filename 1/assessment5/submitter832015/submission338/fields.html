</p><p>DNA methylation is the basis for different epigenetic
phenomena such as imprinting, X chromosome inactivation or the formation of
heterochromatin. Generally, DNA methylation of promoter regions inversely
correlates with gene expression. Exceptions are CpG islands, which are found in
about 60% of promoters. They have a high CpG density and are usually kept free
of methylation independent of their activity state. However, in cancer cells
promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes
silencing of the underlying gene. The epigenome of cancer cells displays
numerous alterations in comparison to the epigenome of their normal
counterpart. Changes in DNA methylation include a genome-wide loss and a
regional gain of DNA methylation. This causes on one hand genomic instability
and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes and on the other hand
silencing of tumor suppressor genes – controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA
repair – by hypermethylation of their promoter CpG islands. Interestingly, no
global hypomethylation but rather a directed hypomethylation at satellite
repeats could be detected in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors using a
genome-wide approach.</p><p><span>Hassler, MR and Egger, G. Epigenomics of cancer – emerging new concepts. Biochimie. 2012; 94 (11): 2219-2230.</span> <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Egger%20G%5Bauth%5D"></a><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;

    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>In genomic imprinting,
one of the two parental alleles of an autosomal gene is silenced epigenetically
by a cis-acting mechanism. A bidirectional silencer for a 400-kilobase region
that contains three imprinted, maternally expressed protein-coding genes
(Igf2r/Slc22a2/Slc22a3) has been shown by targeted deletion, which also contains the promoter for the imprinted,
paternally expressed non-coding Air RNA. Expression of Air is correlated with
repression of all three genes on the paternal allele; however, Air RNA overlaps
just one of these genes in an antisense orientation. Sleutels et al. (2002)
observed that by inserting a polyadenylation signal that truncates 96% of the
RNA transcript, that Air RNA is required for silencing. The truncated Air
allele maintains imprinted expression and methylation of the Air promoter, but
shows complete loss of silencing of the Igf2 gene cluster on
the paternal chromosome. This results indicate that non-coding RNAs have an
active role in genomic imprinting. lncRNAs involved in
imprinting processes are the paternally expressed lncRNA AIR required to silencing the maternally expressed protein-coding genes Igf2r and
inhibits expression by targeting the H3K9 histone methyltransferase G9a to the
Slc22a3 promoter, and paternally expressed lncRNA Kcnq1ot1.</p><p>Hassler et al. Biochimie. 2012;94(11):2219-2230. </p><p>Sleutels et al. Nature. 2002;415(6873):810-3.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.

    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, is the comercial name of  “GSK2816126” drug and is used to treat
myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.
Decitabine is  capable of amount of
histone overmethylation declined dramatically. Dr. Dhanak and his colleagues treated cell cultures and laboratory
animals with Decitabine, they found it also reduces the proliferation of tumour
cells while, crucially, having no apparent effect on nearby normal cells. However, James Bradner of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, in Boston,
described a second epigenetic approach to treating cancer. His group have shown
that is posible inhibit an epigenetic regulator called
BRD4, blocks the activity of a gene by the name of Myc. Myc encodes a protein
called a transcription factor that is another part of the DNA-regulation
system. Not surprisingly, then, when it goes wrong it is one
of the most common causes of cancer.</p><p> New understanding of how cancers work is yielding new treatments. The Economist. Apr 7th 2012. <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168">http://www.economist.com/node/21552168</a><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.

    <div class="field-value">Although it is too early to say for sure, Dr Baylin
speculates that his epigenetic drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting
way that made them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy. These
speculations are that it was the first time epigenetic drugs had been deployed
successfully against a solid tumour, rather than a leukaemia or a lymphoma
(solid tumours are harder to treat, because the drug has to penetrate them).
And, second, some of the participants in Dr Baylin's study who did not show
much response to the trial itself then went on to show an unexpectedly good
reaction to the routine chemotherapeutic drugs which were employed on them
next. <br /><br />New understanding of how cancers work is yielding new treatments. The Economist. <span>Apr 7th 2012. </span><a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" title="Link: http://www.economist.com/node/21552168">http://www.economist.com/node/21552168</a><br /></div>
