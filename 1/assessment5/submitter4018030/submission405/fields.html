    <h1>Submission 405 from Anon (session_user_id: 2aba3016f613c65a40ac9237b8a1ac69c21e77f0)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine, an FDA approved drug against cancer is a nucleoside analogue and a DNMT1 inhibitor, which means that it prevents DNMT1 from methylating the DNA. More specifically, Decitabine is embedded in the DNA and when DNMT1 comes to methylate it, what happens is that the enzyme is irreversibly bound to the DNA and it can't continue the process of the methylation. Thus, Decitabine has a negative impact on DNA methylation. Many tumours are created (additionally) due to DNA hypermethylation of the genome, and especially hypermethylation of the promoters of tumour suppressor genes, so if DNA methylation is hindered, the daughter tumour cells (but not only them) will no longer be hypermethylated in crucial genes whose silencing through DNA methylation, promotes development of the tumour.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal tissues, CpG islands tend to be hypomethylated whereas intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated. CpG islands are located in gene promoters and in order for gene expression to be conducted normally, they are protected from methylation. However, in cancer CpG islands are hypermethylated and this results in silencing of many genes. Amongst these genes, many tumour suppressor genes are included whose silencing, in combination with other genetic or epigenetic abnormalities, may lead to tumour genesis. On the other hand, methylation in intergenic regions of normal cells' DNA prevents genomic instability (which can result to chromosome duplications, reciprocal translocations, insertions, deletions) and contributes in avoiding trancsriptional interference due to cryptical promoters in intergenic regions and unnecessary splicing of mRNA due to cryptic splice sites. Methylation of the repetitive elements helps in the maintainance of gene integrity through their silencing and subsequent prevention of transposition and transcriptional interference; methylation in repeats can also be mutagenic blocking transposition this way and finally, it can prevent illegitimate recombination that can be caused by active repetitive elements. All these features are reversed in cancer cells, where the intergenic regions and the repeats are hypomethylated and so activated and this leads to <strong>genomic instability</strong> accompanied by activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes, transposition and illegitimate recombination between chromosomes that promotes tumour development and is indicative of the disease .</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprinted genes often encode proteins that are essential for growth or growth restriction. Loss of imprinting due to aberrant DNA methylation of the paternal or the maternal allele can cause tumour genesis depending on which gene's expression is disrupted. Such an example is that of the H19/Igf2 cluster, where in healthy persons, the paternal H19 allele is methylated so that the enhancers can promote Igf2 expression, whereas the maternal H19 allele is unmethylated and expressed with the contribution of the enhancers while CTFT binds to the DNA and hinders Igf2 transcription. In Wilm's tumour, both H19 alleles (paternal and maternal) are methylated and this is followed by Igf2 overexpression, which is a growth promoting gene and leads to abnormal growth of tumour cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is inherritable from one cell generation to the next and when it is altered, this altered state of methylation can be inherritable too. This is how drugs that alter DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome that last beyond the period of drug treatment. It is known that epigenetic reprogramming occurs during early development of the embryo and during primordial germ cell and germ cell development and these are identified as the sensitive periods. So in younger patients where germ cell development is ongoing, medication with this kind of drugs would be inadvisable because they target all the cells in a non-specific way, and this could result in affecting germ cell epigenetic reprogramming and production of abnormal gametes.</div>
