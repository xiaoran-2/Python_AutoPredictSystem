    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are areas of high CG dinucleotide content that are present
in about 60% of promoters in the human genome. Usually CpG islands are
hypomethylated, but in some cases of cancer, these CpG islands are
hypermethylated. Hypermethylation of these promoter regions can lead to
silencing of tumor suppressor genes and other genes that give cell-specific
identity. Alternatively, hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive
elements can give rise to cancer. DNA methylation in intergenic regions prevents
cryptic promoter activity or cryptic gene expression, so hypomethylation may
contribute to increased expression of oncogenes. DNA methylation of repetitive
elements prevents unwanted or non-specific DNA recombination in repair
mechanisms. Hypomethylation of repetitive elements can lead to chromosomal
rearrangements, such as inversions, insertions, deletions, and translocations,
that may disrupt normal cell function and lead to cancerous activity.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>In the paternal allele, the ICR at the H19/Icf2 cluster is methylated,
which includes the H19 promoter and prevents CTCF (an insulator protein) from
binding. This means H19 expression would be turned off and allows downstream
enhancers to activate Igf2 expression. In the maternal allele, the ICR is not
methylated, so CTCF is able to bind to the cluster and insulate the enhancer’s
effect on Igf2, and only allow expression of H19. Wilm’s tumor patients have
paternal uniparental disomy at this cluster, which means that Igf2
overly-expressed and upregulated as a result of methylation of ICRs in both
alleles. Increased Igf2 expression promotes growth that leads to embryonic or
childhood tumors.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue that irreversibly binds to DNA
methyltransferase, and can be classified as a DNMTi. This drug leads to
increased non-specific hypomethylation over time through cycles of replication.
Decitabine can have an anti-tumor effect by clearing hypermethylation of tumor
suppressor genes that, when inactive, may have been necessary for the tumor to
thrive.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>DNA methylation is a relatively stable DNA modification that can be
passed down mitotically to daughter cells, and is necessary in maintaining cell
identity. Altering DNA methylation can lead to loss of tissue-specific gene
expression and genome instability. Furthermore, a sensitive period is when DNA
methylation is being actively or passively cleared and re-established in the
genome. Sensitive periods of development include early embryonic development
and primordial germ-cell development. Treating patients during these stages of
development is inadvisable since treatment could result in loss of imprinting,
loss of DNA methylation of repeats, and genomic instability.</span></div>
