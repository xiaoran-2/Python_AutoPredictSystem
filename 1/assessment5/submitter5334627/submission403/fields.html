    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at CpG island normally function as a silencing sign, so downstream genes are not expressed. In normal cells there's hypomethylation on CpG island but in cancer there's hypermethylation on CpG islands. In cancer cells hypermethylation happen on tumor suppressor genes thus silence the gene and altered DNA methylation is resulting the same effect as mutation. <br />In normal cells intergenic region and repeats are silenced by DNA methylation, those regions are silenced in order to protect expressed genes to be functional, if those region are expressed; the protein resulted from its transcription and translation will be altered. In cancer cells intergenic elements and repeats are hypomethyaled, meaning that those regions are expressed. Hypomethylation on repeats and intergenic regions cause genomic instability such as: recombinations, activation of repeats and transposons resulting in disruption in coding region, and activation of cryptic promoters and neighboring genes. Genetic instability is one of the hits of cancer. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Loss of imprinting is one common feature in cancer. In cancer cells loss of imprinting results in expression of both parental alleles or silenced in both parental alleles. In  H19/Igf2 cluster, on paternal allele the ICR is methylated thus CTCF cannot bind to insulator element and the enhancer can promote expression of Igf2 (Igf2 is expressed, H19 is not expressed), On maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated so CTCF can bind to insulator element, the enhancer is now acting on H19 because Igf2 sequence is now blocked (Igf2 is not expressed, H19 is expressed).<br />In Wilm's tumor, the ICR on maternal allele is now methlyated resulting in additional expression of Igf2 gene on maternal allele. This demonstrate the loss of imprinting, in this case both paternal alleles is expressing Igf2. Igf2 has growth promoting function so by doubling dose of Igf2 expression cell will continually grows and in the end results in Wilm's tumor (kidney tumor). <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is one of the epigenetic mark which is mitotically heritable by its mechanism of laying down DNA methylation mark in hemi-methylated DNA strands in dividing cells. <br />Sensitive period is a period when environmental influence may change epigenetic control in the epigenome<br />Sensitive periods of development are pre-implantation period until early post-implatation period and primordial germ cell development until production of mature gametes. These are periods when epigenome are actively reprogrammed. <br />Trating patients during sensitive periods has a really high risk of altering patient's epigenome and thus influencing his/her gene expression.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabene is belong to DNA-demethylating agents, decitabane will erase the DNA methylation mark in cells by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. DNA methyltransferase is an enzyme which lays down DNA methylation in hemi-methylated DNA strands upon replication. Decitabene mechanism is division dependent so cancer or tumor cells are more affected by Decitabene because they divide faster than normal cells. <br /></div>
