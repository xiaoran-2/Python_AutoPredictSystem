    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to

    <div class="field-value">The CpG islands in a healthy human genome
tend to be hypo-methylated.  CpG islands
are thought to function as promoter sequences which can trigger activity in the
genes located next to them. Because we know that nucleotides that are heavily
methylated are associated with DNA inactivity, it would not be beneficial for
most promoter sequences to be heavily methylated.<br /><br /><p><span>An example of how heavy methylation at CpG
islands can alter the function of genes and contribute to a disease state is
seen in many types of cancer. The CpG islands often seen in cancerous tissues
are hyper- methylated when compared with normal healthy tissue.  These abnormal CpG islands are often found
next to gene sequences that function as tumor suppressor regions. If these
regions are inactive they will not make the tumor suppressor factors required
to stop cell proliferation. A group of cancers known as CIMP are known to have
multiple sets of hyper-methylated CpG islands and can be subtyped  based on the location of these CpG regions.</span></p>

<p>In contrast to CpG islands, intergenic regions
and repetitive sequences are heavily methylated in a healthy human genome.
Repetitive regions make up a large portion of the genome. Because their
sequences are so common, activation could cause unwanted replication and
recombination with mismatched genes. Genetic insertions, deletions and translocations
can occur when intergenic regions are hypo-methylated. Many of the blood
cancers and lymphomas are known to be caused by translocations. The Philadelphia chromosome associated with CML involves a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 29.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprinting of genomic regions is a normal
part of genetic regulation in a developing fetus. With imprinting, one of the
parental alleles (the imprinted one) has DNA regions turned off but the second
parental allele remains active. Imprinted regions of the human genome often
contain growth factors which need to be regulated for optimal growth and
maintenance of tissues.

<br /><br /><p><span>In humans the paternal allele has an ICR
which is methylated. The enhancer region of this allele then stimulates the
region that makes IGF2, a growth factor required for proper cell growth.  The corresponding maternal allele has an un-methylated
ICR region which binds a CTCF protein that protects the IGF2 region from
enhancer activity. Another important region on the active maternal allele is a
growth suppressor known as Cdkn1. </span></p>

<p><span>In a pediatric cancer called Wilms tumor, the
maternal allele acts like the paternal one and we see a loss of normal
imprinting. Too much IGF2 is produced and growth suppression from the maternal
Cdkn1 region is not active. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The chemotherapy drug Decitabine belongs to
the de-methylating class of inhibitors. This means that it should reduce
methylation in cancerous tissues. Although the exact mechanism of this new drug
is not known, because it is a de-methylating agent, it may help reactivate
promoters of tumor suppressor regions. This change in cell activity would increase aptosis of cancer cells offering a better prognosis for patients.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The changes in genomic DNA caused by methylation are mitotically heritable. When a strand of DNA undergoes a change in methylation at a CpG di-nucleotide, its daughter strand will have an unmethylated CpG site. Cellular DNMT1 recognizes the hemi-methylated state of DNA during mitosis and provides a methyl group to the daughter strand. For this reason if a  drug is a de-methylating agent, it may have a cellular affect that lasts beyond the treatment phase.<br /><br />Ideally, chemotherapy for cancer should  target cancerous tissues and leave healthy tissues alone. Because drugs that affect DNA methylation can affect tissues mitotically even after treatment stops, it would be unwise to treat a patient who is in a life phase of tissue sensitivity.<br />The main sensitive period to avoid would be pregnancy when a new fetus is actively developing and creating new primordial germ cells.Other sensitive periods include adolescence when sex organs and gametes are maturing,and early childhood when all biological systems are still developing. Because cancer is a serious disease however, the risk of treating a patient in a sensitive period would have to be balanced with the risk of mortality.</div>
