    <div class="field-value">Normally, CpG islands (CGI) are hypomethylated. The normal function of CpG methylation is to silence the CGI regions associated with specific promoters. These promoters are then subsequently silenced in the sequence specific to CGI locus. This methylation then directly effects chromatin structure through indirect action on the histones while at the same time influencing gene and transcription factor activity. <br /><br />This process is altered in cancer because of the high occurrence of DNA methylation in the CGI regions. These highly methylated regions are termed CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP). This process, in turn, causes genomic instability as a direct effect on histone composition and deregulation of specific genes including imprinting and tumor suppressor genes.<br /><br />Normally, there is a significant amount of hypermethylation in intergenic and repetitive regions. These regions are associated with gene regulation and differentiation. These intergenic methylation sites serve to provide accessibility to coding regions of the DNA and provide identifying site for multiple transcription factors involved in the the  structure of chromosomes , histone expression and the expression of genes.<br /><br />In cancer, the intergenic and repetitive regions are disrupted. There is significant evidence of hypomethylation as evidenced in bi-sulfate sequencing. The hypomethylation in these regions subsequently leads to  transcription of genes that would otherwise be silenced in contribute to movement of transposons of  the  genome thus contributing to genetic instability.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprinting in the process of  inheritance specific to the maternal or paternal genome. Imprinting leads to either expression of the maternal or paternal genome in a homologous pair of chromosomes. The activation of these genes are relative to the parent of origin. These imprinted genes mimic haploid expression as the diploid gene is not expressed. These genes can be further disrupted by uni-parental disomy, mutation and deletions in the imprinted gene and disruption to the genes involved in imprinting.This type of disruption is best evidenced in the H19/IGF2 imprinting pairing which contributes to Wilm's tumor. <br /><br /> H19 is only <a>transcribed</a> from the maternally inherited allele. H19 is a long coding RNA that is  normally involved in cell growth inhibition. IGF2 is a growth factor involved in tumor growth and is paternally inherited and is controlled by H19. In normal cells, both genes are expressed.  H19 is solely  expressed in maternal alleles as a result of methylation upstream of the H19 coding region on the paternal  allele. In instance the of Wilms tumor, methylation upstream on the H19 in the maternal allele now prevents the action of H19 and allows exprefssion of IGF2 . This over expression of IGF2 contributes to Wilms tumor. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to a  class of DNA-demethylating agents. It acts by directly inhibiting DNA methyltransferase causing hypomethylation. Hypermethylaion of CpG islands are a hallmark of cancer cells,  either causing inactivation of tumor suppressor cells or activation of  silent oncogenes. <br /><br />Hypomethylation caused by the administration of Decitabine works to restore normal gene function by demethylating these CpG Islands often associated with the promoter or enhancing function of cancer gene expression. <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation can have lasting effect because of it's mitotic inheritabilaty. Epigenetic effects are directly passed on during cell division to successive generations of cells until the replication out runs the load of the epigenetic factor. Once this occurs, there will be no further evidence of this specific epigenetic effect. This type of effect shows promise for epigenetic therapies because they will have a direct effect on the cells of action without disrupting the cellular effects of the surrounding cells.<br /><br />The sensitive period for epigenetic effects include any period during development that will lead to a direct causal relationship between the epigenetic factor and developing cells. This is most often seen when there is a predominance of progenitor or stem cells. The most sensitive period during development is in early development or gametogenesis and germ cell development in the embryo.<br /><br />It would be inadvisable to not treat patients during this time because any epigenetic changes made to these cells will not sustain the load of cell division. In other words, the epigenetic cells will be incorporated into the expressed genome and and and will be evidenced in differentiated cell types producing unregulated expression of genes.<br /></div>
