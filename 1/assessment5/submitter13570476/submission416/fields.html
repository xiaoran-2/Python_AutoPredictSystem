    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><b>Decitabine belong to the class of DNA Methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors.</b><br />I<strong>t is a nucleoside analogue  that is incorporated into DNA upon replication a</strong>nd when DNA methyltransferase comes to bind that nucleotide to copy the methylation to the daughter strand, the methyltransferase is bound irreversibly and it can no longer be released. The action of Decitabine as methyltransferase inhibitor is division dependent. so the cancer cells which are dividing much more rapidly than most other cells in the body will be more severely  affected because they are replicating more.  <br /><strong>Decitabine can have a anti-tumour effect since it inhibits DNA methyltransferase and hence blocks the DNA synthesis required for the proliferation of cancer cells. </strong>Lower doses of Decitabine inhibit methylation and reactivate expression of silenced genes whereas higher doses induce</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"> <b>Drugs that alter DNA methylation have lasting effect because unlike other forms of gene regulation, epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and grand daughter cells until they are actively erased. </b>Once erased though they do not return, it may therefore be that epigentic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer from growing without having to kill all its cells.<br /><b><br />Sensitive period is the period that are sensitive to epigenetic controls. </b>At these times there is active reprogramming happening with removal and then laying down of epigenetic marks at different places in genome.<br /><strong><br />The sensitive periods are- Primodial germ cell development and Preimplantation and early postimplantation period. </strong><br /><strong>The sensitive period is the period of active remodelling of epigenome and hence it would be inadvisable  to treat patients during this period</strong>.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Expression of imprinted gene is controlled by imprint control region (ICR) and Imprint is associated with DNA methylation at the ICR. Mechanism of action of ICR varies with each cluster. H19/Igf2 cluster is present on human chromosome 11 and is controlled by enhancer blocking.<br /><b>When the ICR is unmethylated,</b> <b>as in maternal allele</b>, it is bound by a protein called CTCF and it is an insulator protein. CTCF binding insulates Igf2 from downstream enhacers and there is no expression of Igf2 but enhancer act on H19 and enhance H19 expression.<br /><b>On the paternal allele</b>, <b>when ICR is methylated,</b> CTCF can no longer bind to it and hence enhancers are free to act on Igf2 and promote Igf2 expression from paternal allele.<br />I<strong>mprinting at H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm's tumour as there is hypermethylation of ICR on the maternal allele as well.</strong> There is now expression of Igf2 on maternal allele and so there is double dose of Igf2 (expressed both in maternal and paternal allele) in comparison to what is seen in normal cell. <strong><br />Igf2 is growth promoting and hence disrupted imprinting with active Igf2 in both maternal and paternal allele is associated with tumour formation</strong><br /> <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is the basis for different epigenetic phenomenon such as imprinting, X chromosome inactivation or formation of heterochromatin. CpG islands is often found at promoters of tumour suppressor genes. <b><br />CpG  islands tend to be protected from methylation and if they are methylated then it is associated with silencing of gene expression.</b> <b>So in normal cell CpG islands are devoid of methylation and allow expression of that particular gene if appropriate transcription factors are present and chromatin structure is accessible to them. </b><br />However <b>in cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated which then causes silencing of the underlying gene</b>. So DNA methylation and consequent epigenetic silencing of tumour suppressor gene can be one of the hits (Knudson Hypothesis) for development of cancer.<br /><br />I<b>n normal cells intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated. DNA methylation at intergenic region maintains genomic integrity</b> and DNMT 1 null cells have been found to display genomic instability. DNA methylation at repetitive elements  prevents transposition, avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters and prevent illegitimate recombination. <br />I<b>n cancer the earliest epigenetic aberration found was a genome wide lack of methylation that is hypomethylation  at intergenic regions and repetitive elements and genomic instability.</b> <br />I<b>n hypomethylation of repeats they either jump or have their promoters become active which leads to transcriptional aberration in surrounding regions. The overall outcome is additional deletions, have insertions so that parts of chromosomes are gained and their is reciprocal translocation leading to genomic instability. </b><br />Role of DNA methylation in cancer is context dependent. Different tumours have different dependencies. In tumours driven by tumour suppressor hypermethylation, depletion of DNA methylation appears to suppress tumorigenesis while tumours driven by chromosomal instability , the depletion of DNA methylation appears to enhance tumorigensis<br /><br /><br /></div>
