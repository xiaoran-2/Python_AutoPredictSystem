    <div class="field-value">1. Normally, CpG islands are protected from methylation. Most if not all CpG islands are sites of transcription initiation, near promoters where transcription factors should attach so the gene can be transcribed. If there is methylation at a CpG island, the attachment-points for transcription factors are blocked so the transcription factors can't attach. Methylation at a CpG island almost always leads to inactivation of the gene.<br /><br />2,3 In cancer, CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes can become methylated. Such hypermethylation of CpG islands has been described in almost all cancerous tumors. Tumor suppressors are genes that inhibit growth. Cancers need to grow, and if tumor suppressors can be inactivated, it's much easier for a tumor to grow. <br /><br />4,5,6. Intergenic regions and repeats should normally be silenced by methylation. They don't contain "useful" genes. Repeats code for copies of themselves that then can be inserted into the genome here and there. This may lead to genomic instability, increasing the risk of 
deletions, insertions and translocations of segments between 
chromosomes. A repeat may have a very strong promoter and may activate nearby genes, sometimes from the wrong direction even, thereby wreaking havoc upon the genome. The wrong genes may be transcribed, in the wrong amount and at the wrong time, and genes may be incompletely transcribed. Genes that should be inactive may become active, which is especially unfortunate if it's a growth-promoting gene. DNA repair genes may be inactivated. All this means genomic instability and messes with the normal function of the cell. <br />In cancer, the genome suffers global hypomethylation, meaning that intergenic regions and repeats are not inactivated to the extent that they should be. They may become active, repeats may jump around in the genome and general chaos as described above may result.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">We have about 1000 imprinted genes, genes that only are expressed from the one allele, the one we get from our father or the one we get from our mother. <br />In the H19/Igf2 cluster, normal function is obtained by the paternal allele being methylated. An insulator (CTFC) is thereby stopped from binding to the cluster and enhancers can activate Igf2, a gene encoding Insulin-like growth factor, an ocogene.(Oncogenes promote growth.)<br />On the maternal allele, there should be no methylation. The insulator is thereby able to bind and make the Igf2 gene inaccessible for transcription. The enhancers instead work on the H19 gene which is transcribed. <br /><br />In Wilm's tumor, a kidney tumpor that occurs in young children, both alleles act as the paternal allele. You get twice as much Igf2 as you should have and very little H19. This may be due to a genetic error (f ex you may have inherited 2 copies of the paternal allele) or it may be due to an imprinting error, where the maternal allele is methylated although it shouldn't be.  <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent. <br />Decitabine hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase.<br />DNA methyltransferases maintain methylation of genes through cell division, so that the methylation is mitotically heritable for the life-time of the organism. Without DNA methyltransferases, the methylation will not be maintained after the cell divides. The use of Decitabine may lead to tumor suppressors becoming un-methylated and thus become available for active transcription. Tumor suppressors inhibits growth and cancer tumors need to grow. It's alsopossible that genes involved in DNA-repair may be re-activated though demethylation.<br /> <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically inheritable. The DNA strand that is used as a template strand in replication is methylated, the complimentary strand gets methylated to match by methyltransferases. This way methylation becomes permanent through cell divisions. This is also the reason why altering of methylation can have long lasting effect.<br />Methylation and demethylation occurs during sensitive periods in an organism's life, when the genome is reprogrammed: old epigenetic marks from the mother's egg and the father's sperm are removed and new marks are laid down. Two sensitive periods of development are the early embryonic stage (preimplantation stage) and during the formation of germ-cells in the embryo (happens around mid-gestation).<br />Treating patients during sensitive periods would be likely to disrupt the normal clearing of epigenetic marks and the laying down of new, appropriate epigenetic marks in the embryo and in the germcells of the embryo which will one day become the grand children of the patient. <br /></div>
