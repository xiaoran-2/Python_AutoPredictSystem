    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation involves the addition of a methyl group to the cytosines in CpG dinucleotides and is typically associated with gene silencing; it is an inactive epigenetic mark.  CpG islands - high frequency clusters of CpG sites - tend to be found at the promotor regions of genes where transcription machinery binds and, as a general rule, are protected from methylation.<br /><br />One of the hallmarks of cancer is aberrant DNA methylation and, in particular, hypermethylation of CpG islands found in the promotors of tumour suppressor genes, resulting in consequent silencing of those genes and an inability to repress tumorgenesis.  CpG island hypermethylation and this associated gene silencing is generally found in all tumours studied.<br /><br />The genome is mostly comprised of intergenic regions and repetitive elements, so such a vast area requires control for genetic stability. The intergenic regions and repetitive elements are consequently therefore usually methylated.  DNA methylation allows for genetic stability by silencing cryptic transcriptional sites to avoid transcriptional interference with RNA polymerases, protecting the genome from transposable elements by silencing LTR repeats to prevent gag and pol proteins from posting elsewhere in the genome and causing disruption, and by preventing illegitimate recombination between repeats that results in duplications or loss of chromosomes.<br /><br />In cancer, hypomethylation is seen genome-wide, and in particular at the intergenic regions and repetitive elements.  Hypomethylation to these areas causes genomic instability by way of illegitimate recombinations between chromosomes occurring as a result of misalignment of these regions due to not being as densely packaged as heterochromatin.  Cryptic promoters and LTR repeats are also activated resulting in transposition and activation/disruption to neighbouring genes.  The deletions, insertions and reciprocal translations resulting from this DNA hypomethylation at the intergenic regions and repetitive elements consequently creates an environment of genomic instability that enhances tumorgenesis and subsequently contributes to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprinting is the state of monoallelic gene expression, whereby only one of the two alleles of autosomal genes inherited from the mother and father is expressed in a parent-of-origin specific manner.  Imprinted gene expression is controlled by ICRs in a locus-specific manner.  In the H19/Igf2 cluster, the ICR is paternally imprinted, whereby it is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele.<br /><br />On the maternal allele, the unmethylated ICR is able to be bound by the insulator protein CTCF, blocking the effect of the downstream enhancers on the lgf2 gene, so that the enhancers can only act on H19 to enhance its expression.  For the paternal allele, methylation of the ICR blocks the binding and insulation activity of CTCF, allowing DNA methylation to spread to and silence the H19 promoter, resulting in the enhancers being able to act on and express lgf2.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumour, imprinting is disrupted at the<span> H19/Igf2 cluster as a result of the maternal allele ICR <u>also</u> being methylated, resulting in lgf2 being expressed in a 'double dose' compared with a normal cell. </span> As lgf2 is a growth promoting gene, disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster in this way therefore enhances tumorgenesis.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-hypomethylating agent used to treat Myelodysplastic Syndromes as a chemotherapeutic that targets the epigenetic machinery in cancer given that, unlike mutations, epigenetic alterations are reversible.<br /><span><br />Aberrant DNA methylation is associated with inappropriate gene silencing in cancer.  In M</span>yelodysplastic Syndromes hypermethylation of tumour-suppressor gene (TSG) promoters occurs, resulting in cancer cell proliferation.  Decitabine is employed as a DNA Methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi), a class of epigenetic inhibitor that targets e<span>nzymatic regulators by reducing the effects of DNMT on TSG methylation to thus inhibit the growth of cancer cells.<br /><br /></span>Decitabine is a nucleoside analog, whereby it is incorporated directly into DNA upon cell division and binds to DNMTs irreversibly, rendering their 'methylation maintenance' effects inactive so that the aberrant TSG promoter methylation is reversed and transcriptionally silenced genes are re-expressed.  The <span>anti-tumour effects</span> persist via mitosis by way of a passive loss of methylation in daughter cells after replication.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the pre-implantation period, sperm and egg DNA methylation and histone marks are removed from the zygote and the appropriate epigenetic marks are laid down for embryo development in a cell type specific manner.  During primordial germ cell development these somatic epigenetic marks are removed via active, rapid demethylation of the paternal genome and passive demethylation of the maternal genome, and germ cell specialised functions are epigenetically instated by DNA methylation.  Imprinted genes are also cleared and reset in a lineage-specific pattern.  From hereon these epigenetic marks are generally maintained.<br /><br />These are both 'sensitive' periods in that they are critical periods of development where environmental influences can have enduring effects on epigenome programming during the periods of DNA demethylation and subsequent methylation that are occurring in the genome, resulting in transgenerational inheritance, where an environmentally induced phenotype can be heritably transmitted.<br /><br />Interfering with DNA methylation processes during sensitive periods renders the genome very susceptible to genomic instability and epigenetic abnormalities, in particular aberrant imprinting.  Treating patients during sensitive periods with drugs that alter DNA methylation would therefore be inadvisable as this could have a much broader and unpredicted effect on the genome rather than acting as a targeted treatment.<br /></div>
