    <div class="field-value">In mammals, DNA methylation occurs almost exclusively in CpG dinucleotides, and this methylation is maintained through cell division by <em>de novo</em> methyltransferases (DNMT). CpG dinucleotides are clustered into CpG islands, typically appearing in the promoters of genes.The methylation at CpG islands in the promoter of a gene silences the gene expression. This silencing depends on cell type, and <strong>normally most of the CpG islands are unmethylated.</strong> <br /><br /><strong>In cancer there's an increase in the CpG islands methylation</strong>; consequently, a number of genes, normally active, are silenced. The regions near (2kb) the CpG islands, called CpG shores, are also hypermethylated, which also reduces gene expression. <strong>Many of the genes silenced by this process in cancer are tumor suppressor genes,</strong> which contributes to tumorigenesis, and is associated to metastasis. <br /> <br /><strong>Normally intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated.</strong> In intergenic regions this methylation is associated to <strong>maintenance of genomic integrity</strong>, by silencing cryptic transcription start sites and cryptic splice sites. Repetitive elements methylation also contributes to genomic integrity maintenance, by for example preventing transposition, transcriptional interference from strong promoters and possibly illegitimate recombination.<br /><br /><strong>In cancer, there is a genome-wide decrease of methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements </strong>(except in CpG islands mentioned above). This leads to <strong>genomic instability</strong> caused by the mechanisms presented in the previous paragraph: illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighboring genes.<span class="_wysihtml5-temp"></span><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normally, in the <b>paternal allele DNA methylation at the ICR blocks binding of CTCF</b>, an insulator protein. If CTCF doesn't bind, methylation spreads to H19 promoter, silencing it. Because H19 is silenced the <b>downstream enhancers after the gene activate </b><b>Igf2</b> instead. <br /><br /><b>The same region in the maternal allele is unmethylated, allowing CTCF to bind, which leaves H19 activated. </b>In this case the downstream enhancers activate H19 itself, and <strong>Igf2 isn't expressed</strong> as in the paternal allele.<br /><br /><strong>In Wilm's tumour there is hypermethylation of the ICR</strong>, causing the maternal allele (which normally doesn't express Igf2) to become similar to the paternal allele (i.e., imprinting is lost: ICR methylation prevents CTCF binding, thus siencing H19 and allowing activation of lgf2 by the downstream enhancers). Consequently, <strong>lgf2 dosage is doubled, i.e., the gene is overexpressed</strong>.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><em><strong>Decitabine </strong></em><strong>is an DNA-demethylating agent</strong>, also known as <i><b>de novo</b></i><b> methyltransferase inhibitor</b> (DNMTi). It binds to the DNMTs, preventing methylation maintenance through cell division, thus <b>reducing DNA methylation over time</b>. <br /><br />In cancer there is silencing by hypermethylation of tumor suppressing genes. Since decitabine reduces DNA methylation it may revert this process, <strong>increasing expression of these tumor suppressing genes. </strong><span class="_wysihtml5-temp"></span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><strong>DNA methylation is maintained through cell division by DNMTs, so changes in the epigenetic state though DNA methylation can have long lasting effects.</strong> <br /><br /><strong>If the epigenetic drug</strong> removes the methylation and consequently <strong>reactivates tumor suppressing genes</strong>, for example, this change will be maintained after cell replication; this could explain why chemotherapy worked better after the treatment.  <br /><br />Epigenetic marks / DNA methylation that occurs in <strong>early embryonic development</strong>, related for example to cell differentiation, are maintained during the entire life of the individual. The period when these epigenetic marks are laid down is called a <strong>sensitive period</strong>. Another sensitive period is during <strong>primordial germ cell development</strong> in the mid-gestation embryo. <strong>In both sensitive periods we see epigenetic reprogramming, i.e., existing epigenetic marks are removed and new ones are laid down.</strong><br /><br /><strong>Epigenetic drugs should not be used during these sensitive periods</strong>, because they may disrupt these processes with long lasting (or possibly fatal) consequences. Disruption during early embryonic development could create <strong>epigenetic problems in all somatic cells of a specific lineage</strong>, and disruption during primordial germ cell development could lead to <strong>infertility</strong> or <strong>imprinting disorders</strong>, for example.<br /></div>
