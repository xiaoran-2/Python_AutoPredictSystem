    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is found primarily at cytosine–guanosine dinucleotides (CpGs). Such CpG sites occur at lower than expected frequencies throughout the genome but are found more frequently in CpG islands. These islands are typically found in or near promoter regions of genes, where transcription is initiated. are associated with gene promoters and other regulatory features, resulting in a reduced transcription potential. </p><p>In cancers DNA methylation of the CpG islands is increased (Hypermethylation). Hypermethylation of CpG islands located in the promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes is now firmly established as an important mechanism for gene inactivation.<br /></p><p>In contrast to the bulk of genomic DNA, in which most CpG sites are heavily methylated, DNA methylation helps to maintain transcriptional silence in nonexpressed or noncoding regions of the genome. For example, Heterochromatin is highly methylated and is condensed and transcriptionally inactive. Hypermethylation ensures that this DNA is late-replicating and transcriptionally silent, and suppresses the expression of any potentially harmful viral sequences or transposons that may have integrated into such sites containing highly repetitive sequences. By contrast, these sites are generally unmethylated in promoter regions of Euchromatin, regardless of the transcriptional state of the gene. </p><p>A clear exception to this are regions that may be methylated to maintain transcriptional inactivation. This is why the CpG islands in promoters of genes located on the inactivated X chromosome of females are methylated.</p><p>Epigenetic effects such as hypermethylation can also induce inevitable alterations in gene expression. Methylation of the DNA repair genes MLH1 and MGMT can lead to their inactivation, resulting in microsatellite instability and increased frequency of mutations, respectively. Methylation can also promote spontaneous deamination, enhance DNA binding of carcinogens, and increase ultraviolet absorption by DNA, all of which serve to increase the rate of mutations and DNA adduct formation and subsequent gene inactivation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19 differentially methylated region (H19 DMR) controls the parent-specific genomic imprinting of both the H19 and igf2 genes. In most tissues, only the copy inherited from a person's father (the paternally inherited copy) is active; the copy inherited from the mother (the maternally inherited copy) is not active. </p><p>In Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, both the maternally inherited copy and the paternally inherited copy of the IC1 region have methyl groups attached (hypermethylation). Normally only the parental copy is methylated. Because the IC1 region controls the genomic imprinting of the IGF2 and H19 genes, this abnormality disrupts the regulation of both genes. The consequent increased activity of the IGF2 gene (promotes growth) and a loss of H19 gene (restrains growth) activity, together lead to overgrowth.<br /></p><p>As stated above, normally, the IGF2 gene undergoes genomic imprinting and only the copy inherited from a person's father is active. In some cancers, however, both the paternally inherited and the maternally inherited copies of the gene are active, increasing the amount of insulin-like growth factor 2 that cells can produce. This loss of imprinting and increased amount of insulin-like growth factor 2 may stimulate the growth of tumour cells and prevent damaged cells from being destroyed.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent (referred to as a DNA-demethylating agent in the article). It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), permanently binding it. It effectively reverses the effect of hypermethylation in the genome and there is potential that this will reduce the risk and progression of some cancers.  An important limitation for such demethylating agents is their inherent need for actively dividing cells in which to incorporate and the lack of specificity in which methyl groups are removed. If the cancer is driven by tumour suppressor hypermethylation then reduction of DNA methylation appears to suppress tumorigenesis, Conversely if the cancer is driven by chromosomal instability, depletion of DNA methylation might enhance tumorigenesis.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation (considered epigenetic marks) are retained outside of sensitive periods:-<br /><ul><li>post early development (from fertilisation to blastocyst)</li><li>during primordial germ cell development</li></ul>Outside of sensitive period the marks are stable and propagated via mitosis in all tissues. During the sensitive periods, methylation is removed and subsequently restored, the use of demethylating agents during this clearing and resetting of marks may interfere with the normal developmental processes of the embryo or gametes. This will likely increase genomic instability with a higher risk of subsequent tumourigenesis. <br /><div>  <br /></div></div>
