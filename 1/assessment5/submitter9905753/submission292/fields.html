    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation at CpG islands, which are regions with high prevalence of Cytocines bound to Guanines, determines whether the promoted gene is expressed and how much. Normally the CpG islands are hypomethylated but in cancer they can become hypermethylated, which means the gene is less expressed and a loss of function ensues. Methylation of promoters for Tumor Suppressor Genes (TSGs), which encode proteins involved in the maintenance of DNA structure, control of cell proliferation, etc., means that unchecked growth (i.e. cancer) can occur. For example, the promoter for the MGMT gene, which is involved in DNA mismatch repair, is frequently methylated in colon cancer and mutation rate is therefore increased.<br /><br />Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually DNA methylated to prevent disruptions of gene expression. In cancer they have been found to be hypomethylated, which leads to disrupted transcription due to noise, antisense transcription, different RNA splicing, etc.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The gene Igf2, Insulin-like growth factor 2, is important for growth and development and is usually expressed on the paternal allele. <br /><br />The gene H19 is a tumor suppressor gene and is expressed on the maternal allele with the Igf2 imprinted (i.e. silenced).<br /><br />The Imprinting Control Region (ICR) in the H19/Igf2 gene cluster is methylated on the paternal allele. This prevents the CTCF protein to enhance the H19 promoter. The H19 gene is also methylated. Enhancers of the Igf2 gene are accessible which increases it's expression.<br /><br />On the maternal allele the ICR is not mehylated and the CTCF protein can thus bind to it and mediate the enhancer blocking of H19. This enhances the expression of the H19 gene and represses the Igf2.<br /><br />In Wilm´s tumor the H19 gene on the maternal allele is methylated and thus not expressed. There is also Loss of Imprinting (LOI) of Igf2, leading to it's overexpression and thus cancer.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The drug Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi). A DNA methyltransferase is an enzyme that enhances the binding of a methyl group to DNA. <br /><br />When cells import Decitabine the activity of some DNMT are reduced, leading to less methylated DNA.<br /><br />In certain cancers the CpG island are hypermethylated and the corresponding genes underexpressed, leading to loss of function, f.ex. in the case of Tumour Suppressor Genes (TSGs). Decitabine would thus counteract this, allowing increased expression of TSGs, i.e. an anti-tumour effect.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic marks, f.ex. DNA methylations, ,are usually mitotically heritable, that is daughter cells inherit these marks from the mother cell. If these marks are altered this will have enduring effects.<br /><br />A sensitive period in this context is a period when cells are especially vulnerable to alteration of DNA methylation, i.e. when these alterations would have far reaching consequences.<br /><br />A sensitive period is f.ex. when germ cells are developing and genomic imprinting occurs. An altered DNA methylation would thus have a transgenerational effect.<br /><br />Parent of origin imprinting is very important for normal development of the fetus, an altered imprinting might lead to death of the fetus or a grave defect.<br /><br /><br /></div>
