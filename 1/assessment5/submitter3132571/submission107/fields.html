    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands, which are regions of high CpG density, are found
in most promoters. These islands are hypomethylated in normal cells to allow
expression of the genes activated by those promoters. In cancer cells, CpG
islands are hypermethylated and this prevents gene expression. Such silencing
of tumor suppressor genes which regulate the cell cycle, apoptosis, or DNA
repair can result in cancer. Cells with silenced tumor suppressor genes have a
survival advantage over the neighboring normal cells and proliferate rapidly
creating more cells like themselves since DNA methylation is mitotically
heritable. This results in a cancerous tumor. Hypermethylation of CpG islands,
called the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), has been found in multiple
tumor types; however, different tumor types hypermethylate CpG islands of
different tumor suppressor genes. Additionally, CpG island shores, 2kb regions
surrounding CpG islands are also hypermethylated in cancer, but hypomethylated
in normal cells, suggesting that methylation spreads from the promoter to
neighboring regions in both normal and cancer cells. Intergenic regions,
repetitive elements, and introns within genes are hypermethylated in normal
cells to prevent any expression from these regions. However, they are
hypomethylated in cancer cells. This loss of methylation can result in
illegitimate recombination of different chromosomes by reciprocal translocation
of similar repeated sequences on the chromosomes that are usually hypermethylated,
but now consist of open chromatin due to loss of methylation. Hypomethylation
can activate repeats and cause them to be transposed to other regions of the
genome, thus activating or disrupting other genes or activating cryptic
promoters. These events can lead to insertion and deletion of entire
chromosomes. All these aberrant events due to hypomethylation of repeats and
intergenic regions can cause cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprint control region (ICR) of the H19/Igf2 gene cluster
and the H19 gene are methylated on the paternal allele. CTCF cannot bind to the
ICR of the paternal allele. Therefore, the enhancers bind to the Igf2 gene and
cause expression of the Igf2 gene from the paternal allele. However, the ICR is
unmethylated on the maternal allele. This causes CTCF to bind to the ICR and
act as an insulator, preventing access of enhancers to the Igf2 gene. Enhancers
bind to the unmethylated H19 gene instead. The H19 gene is expressed, but Igf2
is silenced on the maternal allele. In Wilm’s tumor, the ICR is hypermethylated
in both paternal and maternal alleles. This causes the loss of maternal
imprinting of the H19/Igf2 cluster. Igf2 is expressed from both alleles in Wilm’s
tumor resulting in double dose of Igf2 compared to a normal cell. Since Igf2
promotes cell growth, the increase of its dose results in tumor formation and subsequently
cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyl transferase inhibitor. It causes
DNA de-methylation at low doses. It is incorporated into DNA during replication.
DNA methyl transferase binds irreversibly to decitabine as it tries to copy the
methylation into daughter strands. Replicating myelodysplastic syndrome tumor
cells that cause DNA methylation can be killed by decitabine at very low doses.
Decitabine may be involved in preventing CpG island hypermethylation of tumor
suppressor genes. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. Therefore, altered
DNA methylation percolates to daughter cells during cell division. This causes
methylation changes to accumulate over time and cause diseases such as cancer. However,
changes in DNA methylation are reversible and the reversal is also mitotically
heritable. Therefore, using drugs to reverse aberrant methylation changes can
potentially cure diseases caused by changes in DNA methylation. Sensitive
periods are periods of development during which epigenetic marks such as DNA
methylation are established. During this period, the cells are more sensitive to environmental factors causing epigenetic changes. The sensitive periods of development are during primordial
germ cell development and in the pre-implantation embryo. Epigenetic drugs
affect all cells of the body. Therefore, treating patients during sensitive
periods can disrupt the establishment of correct epigenetic mechanisms.
Treating young patients whose germ cells are being developed can cause meiotically
heritable epigenetic changes that can affect future generations.</p></div>
