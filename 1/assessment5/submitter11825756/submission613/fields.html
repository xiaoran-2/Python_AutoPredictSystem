    <h1>Submission 613 from Anon (session_user_id: 05d765f3202530bb2221413aba35b18ec5072b22)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine, sold as Dacogen, belongs to the DNA-demethylation class of chemical agents utilised against cancer. These agents act to inhibit DNMT1 through irreversible binding of the enzyme, to prevent the contiunual aberrant methylation pattern. Hence in regions of DNA hypermethylation, such as CpG islands and shores (indicative of cancer cells), decitabine acts to retract this methylation to a standard cellular state of hypomethylation. This allows the expression of tumour suppressors to resume, a process previously inhibited by said hypermethylation in CpG islands and shores.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Regular DNA methylation occurs in cells primarily in intergenic regions and repetitive elements, whilst CpG islands and shores are hypomethylated, a desirable state as this allows expression of tumour suppression genes. In cancer however, there is hypermethylation of these CpG islands, and hypomethylation of the other sites. This hypermethylation at CpG islands and shores in cancer cells causes silencing of tumour suppressor genes, allowing the prevalant growth of these cancer cells to continue. The overexpression of the intergenic regions and repetitive elements also contributes to the perpetual growth and division of the cancer cell. This CpG island hypermethylation is also observed to increase with age, and from this it is correlated that this may be the main determinant for increased risk of cancer with aging.  <br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Utilising DNA methylation for cancer treatments may have lasting effects through a transgenerational effect, depending upon time of treatment. Treatment should be defered until subjects are outside of sensitive periods. A sensitive period is a duration wherein epigenetic reprogramming is occuring across the chromosomes. The most sensitive periods are during early development, in the states of primordial germ cells and blastocysts, where such reprogramming is typically taking place. Hence epigenetic treatments are inadvisable during periods of pregnancy, particularly in the early stages, as this may lead to inherited alterations to DNA methylation not only in the second generation, but in the third generation also. Use of epigenetic treatments in youth is also inadvisable, as the effect on the developing germ cells must be considered in these subjects also.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Methylation of the imprint control region in the paternal allele inhibits the binding of CTCF, and thereby allows enhancers to encourage expression of Igf2, located upstream. In the maternal allele however, this control region is hypomethylated, allowing CTCF binding, and thereby facilitating enhancers to alternately encourage expression of H19, instead of Igf2. In Wilm's tumour, it is observed that both alleles display hypermethylation, causing an overexpression of Igf2. With this overexpression, there is disruption to the standard growth cycle, leading to unlimited expansion and division of the cells, the prime determinant of cancer cells.</div>
