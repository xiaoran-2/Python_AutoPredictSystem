    <div class="field-value">CpG islands are often found at promoters of genes and tend to be protected from methylation to allow gene expression. Merely in oncogenes, intergenic regions and repetitive elements, CpG islands are methylated to keep them silent. In cancer, locus specific DNA hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes can be found at both CpG islands and CpG island shores, resulting in the inactivation of these suppressor genes. Thereby, different patterns of CpG island hypermethylation are associated with different disease prognoses and responses to therapy. In oncogenes, intergenic regions and repetitive elements, however, the CpG islands are not methylated and therefore expressed. <br />Both intergenic regions, which are sections of non-coding DNA between genes, and repetitive elements, which are sequences of few nucleotides that are repeated again and again, are densely packed and not accessible. In case of cancer, these regions are hypomethylated and are accessible for transcripton. This causes genomic instability through several mechanisms: a) illegitimate recombination between repeats leading to wrong crossing-over between non-paired chromosomes, b) activation of repeats and transposition resulting in truncated transcripton as well as c) activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes. All in all, the altered DNA methylation in cancer results in silencing of tumour suppressor and growth restriction genes and, thus, facitlitates cancer cell growth.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>In the paternal allel,
the ICR associated with lgf2 is methylated, which results in the enhancers to stimulate
the expression of lgf2. In the maternal allel, the ICR is not methylated allowing the
protein CTCF to bind and block the preferencial action of the enhancers on lgf2. Instead, the enhancers will stimulate the expression of H19. In Wilm's
tumour the ICRs on both alleles are methylated which leads to an overexpression
of lgf2 and silencing of H19. Taking into consideration that lgf2 is a growth
promotor and H19 a growth restricting gene, the overexpression of the first and
silencing of the second will cause a tumour.</span><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to the DNA-demethylating agents, which are used to treat myelosplastic syndromes. As a demethylating agent it removes methyl groups from the DNA and opens the densely packed heterochromatin into euchromatin which can then be transcribed. Many tumours have hypermethylated CpG islands, which e.g. results in gene silencing of tumour suppressor genes and growth restrictor genes. Through the action of Decitabine, these CpG islands will be reactivated and so the tumour suppressor and growths restrictor genes will be expressed. Through this expression, the cells cannot grow and divide uncontrollably and the tumours growth will be stopped or prevented.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Most epigenetic marks are established during two particular stages of development: germ cell development and pre-implantation development. During these stages, either the environment or human manipulation - e.g. by creating a higher availability of methyl groups through diet - can affect the establishment of the marks. Epigenetic marks are mitotically inheritable, i.e. they pass through the somatic line till the end of an individual's life. Thus, any alteration of DNA methylation induced during the sensitive periods will be maintained. <br />Drugs are non-specific, therefore they do not only target diseased cells or altered DNA methylations, but the whole genome. Consequently, a drug treatment during the sensitive periods, when the epigenetic marks are established, would result in a disruption of the normal marks. Naturally, this does not only apply to infants, but also to pregnant women.<br /><br /></div>
