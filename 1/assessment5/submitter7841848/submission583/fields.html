    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">- The methylation pattern of the paternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated at the imprint control region such that CTCF can not bind and enhancers act of Igf2 leading to it's expression.<br />- The methylation pattern of the maternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster is unmethylated, such that CTCF can bind at the imprint control region (ICR). This results in enhancers acting on H19 expression.<br />- In Wilm's tumor, the paternal allele is methylated AND the maternal allele is also methylated resulting in over-expression of the Igf2 allele since both copies of the allele will be expressed. <br />- This hypermethylation of the ICR of the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer since Igf2 is a growth promoting gene that can increase the rate of cell division and cancer cell proliferation.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">- The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is gene silencing.  (methylation will decrease/prevent gene expression)<br />- Tumor suppressor genes, which stop uncontrolled cellular growth, are normally unmethylated, an therefore expressed.  However, in cancer, these genes have hypermethylation of the CpG islands and CpG island shores.  This results in a decrease in the expression of these cancer preventing genes.  (Often this hypermethylation can be used as biomarkers for diagnosis and determination of treatment.)<div>- Disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer by decreasing the expression of tumor suppressor genes.  As their name implies, tumor suppressor genes are genes that lead to the translation of proteins/enzymes that 'turn off' the growth of tumors.  For example, Tumor suppressor genes control processes such as DNA repair or programed cell death.  Without the expression of these genes, cancer cells can proliferate unchecked.<br />- DNA methylation in repetitive elements (repeats) and intergenic regions normally maintains genomic stability. </div><div>- In cancer, hypomethylation (reduction in methylation) occurs at these intergenic regions and repetitive elements leading to genome instability, mistakes in recombination, and a lack of condensation of DNA into tightly packed heterochromatin.  Furthermore, activation of repetitive elements due to hypomethylation can lead to increases in transposable element effects, silencing and activating other genes that these transposable elements "jump" into.  Ultimately, this genomic instability often leads to cancer.<br />- Disruption of DNA methylation in the intergenic regions and repeats leads to genomic instability resulting in DNA mutations, such as deletions, insertions, and reciprocal translocations, which can lead to cancer.<br /><br /></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">- DNA methylation and epigenetic marks are mitotically hereditable. Which means epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division.  The Economist article explains that once the epigenetic marks are erased, they do not return. Therefore, if you can alter epigenetic cancer causing marks, you could treat cancer.<br />- A sensitive period is a period during development where the genome is more susceptible to epigenetic changes. Often environment (exposure to chemicals, diet) may effect epigenetic marks during these sensitive periods.<br />- Sensitive periods during development occur in early embryonic development and also during the development of primordial germ cells.  During these sensitive periods is when epigenetic marks are established.<br />- Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because epigenetic reprograming occurs during these times, and numerous studies have shown (Avon longitudinal study, Overkalix study, and Agouti viable gene experiments in mice) these epigenetic marks can have trans-generational effects.  Additionally there is some concern in treating young patients with developing germ cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">- Decitabine belongs to the class of epigenetic enzyme inhibitors called DNA-demethyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi)<br />- Decitabine binds to and prevents/inhibits the action of DNA methyltransferase enzymes; thus removing methyl groups from DNA as the cells replicate.<br />- By removing methyl groups, genes such as tumor suppressor genes, can be activated leading to an anti-tumor effect by preventing uncontrolled cell growth.  Additionally, according the chemocare.com, Decitabine is an antimetabolite which can cause a cytotoxic effect which leads to the death of cancer cells.</div>
