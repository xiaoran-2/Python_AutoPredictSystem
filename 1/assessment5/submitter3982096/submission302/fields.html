    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>

        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division. If you can erase the epigenetic changes (including DNA methylation patterns), they do not return, and therefore have an enduring effect on the epigenome. </p><div>Sensitive periods are the periods when epigenentic marks seem to be the most sensitive to changes in</div><div>the environment. It is a time when there is active reprogramming, with removal and then laying down of epigenetic marks.<br /><br /></div><div><div>The period of primordial germ cell development all the way through to the production of mature eggs and sperm seems to be one sensitive period. The second sensitive period is the pre-implantation period and early post-implantation period, shown here, and both of these periods you'll remember are periods of active  remodelling of the epigenome.<br /><br />Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because you could potentially affect the sperm, eggs, or developing fetus in case of pregnancy.  The effects of this would be unknown.  </div><div><br /></div></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">Generally, DNA methylation of promoter regions reduces gene expression. Exceptions are CpG islands, which are found in about 60% of promoters. Normally, they have a high CpG density and are usually kept free of methylation independent of their activity state<span>. <br /><br />However, in cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene</span><span>. <br /><br /></span>Changes in DNA methylation include a genome-wide loss and a regional gain of DNA methylation. This causes on one hand genomic instability and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes and on the other hand silencing of tumor suppressor genes – controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair – by hypermethylation of their promoter CpG islands.<span><br /><br /></span>The intergenic regions and repetitive elements in cancer are hypomethylated.  This is the opposite in normal cells. <br /><br />The consequence of hypomethylation of repeats and ntergenic regions leads to genomic instability and enhances tumorigenesis. Possible mechanisms include illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, or activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes (c.f. Avy and Axinfu alleles).  </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The paternal allele has the imprinting control allele (ICR) methylated, therefore, the enhancers express Igf2.  <br /><br />The maternal allele has the ICR unmethylated, therefore, the enhancers express H19 and not Igf2.  <br /><br />In WIlm's tumour, both the paternal and maternal ICR is hypermethylated and therefore they both express Igf2.  <br /><br />Double expression of Igf2 leads to cancer because Igf2 is growth promoting.  </div>
