    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">A really common features of cancer cells is the loss of imprinting. In other worlds, genes that should be displayed form one allele, but rather these genes might be expressed form both parental alleles or silenced form both parental alleles. These genes are usually involved in growth.  We can find hypermethylation of ICRs and hypomethylation too.<br />An example of hypermethylation of ICRs in cancer is what occurs at H19/igf2 cluster. As we know in the H19/igf2 cluster there is a ICR. It's methylated on the paternal allele and it's unmethylated on the maternal allele. When ICR is unmethylated, a protein called CTCF will bind and make a DNA-protein complex. Due to this, enhancers won't act on Igf2 so Igf2 will be silenced on maternal allele. <br />In the other hand, ICR is methylated on paternal allele, CTCF can't bind, enhancers will act on Igf2 and it will be expressed. <br /><br />However, if you have hypermethylation both alleles would be methylated and Igf2 would be over-expressed (Expressed from maternal allele and paternal allele). Igf2 is a growth promoter and it's associated with Wilm's tumor. So, hypermethylation might produce a over expression of Igf2. It's a growth promoter and it will develop a tumour.</div>

    <div class="field-value">The 5mC is found in approximately 70–80% of CpG dinucleotides in somatic mammalian cells. DNA methylation is the basis for different epigenetic phenomena such as imprinting, X chromosome inactivation or the formation of heterochromatin. Generally, DNA methylation of promoter regions inversely correlates with gene expression.<br /><p>Unusually high frequency of DNA methylation at CpG rich sites was termed CIMP. CIMP is associated with diverse clinicopathological characteristics. In analogy to genetic mutation, tumors seem to accumulate higher levels of DNA methylation during tumor progression and genome-wide profiling of DNA methylation has proven useful for tumor classification of different tumor types. Another target of aberrant DNA methylation in cancer are CpG island shores. These regions were identified hypermethylated in cancer. Methylation of shore regions is related to gene expression and has also been detected in different tumor cell lines. Moreover, large hypervariable blocks covering half the genome show differences in gene expression patterns, involving genes that regulate tumor-associated processes such as cell division and matrix remodeling.</p><p>Changes in DNA methylation cause on one hand genomic instability and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes and on the other hand silencing of tumor suppressor genes – controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair – by hypermethylation of their promoter CpG islands.</p><p>Intergenic regions, repetitive elements and lncRNAs can also contribute to modulation of cell cycle networks in the cell.</p><p>Altered epigenetic patterns in cancer cells are also associated with the deregulation of lncRNAs and subsequent re-positioning of chromatin modifying complexes.  Overexpression of HOTAIR leads to different PCR2 occupancy at chromatin sites and altered H3K27 methylation. Another lncRNA involved is ANRIL. It's an important regulator of cell cycle progression, apoptosis and cellular senescence. According to an interesting new hypothesis non-coding RNAs can, besides assembling chromatin complexes and modulating cell cycle networks.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine belongs to DNMTi<br /><br />Decitabine is a nucleoside analog. So it get incorporated in the DNA upon replication and then when the DNA methyltransferase comes along to bind it and that nucleoside binds DNA methyltransferase irreversibly. DNMT is a enzyme that add methyl groups on DNA. So, if DNMT is inhibited it wouldn't add methyl groups on DNA and DNA is hypomethylated. <br /><br />Decitabine is used to as a anti-tumour drug because it avoids adding methyl groups on the daughter strand. The action of Decitabine is division dependent so you have to have the cell replicating. Cancer cells that are dividing more rapidly than other cells will be severely affected because they are replicating more. Decitabine like others DNMTi are very useful in tumour that are caused by a CpG islands hypermethilation, because they avoid methylation on the daughter strand and the cancer cells mostly die. <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><br />Sensitive period are when altered environments have an effect on epigenetic control.<br />The sensitive period of development are the period of primordial germ cells, the pre-impantation and early post-implantation period.<br />Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because in those periods epigenetic marks are remodeled so it's not useful make changes on the epigenetic marks because those changes will be eliminated or changed. <br /></div>
