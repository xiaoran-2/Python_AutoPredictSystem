    <div class="field-value"><p>One of the functions of DNA
methylation is to maintain genomic stability—i.e., prevent loss or gain of parts
of chromosomes or illegitimate combinations of repeats.  In normal cells, CpG islands are
hypomethylated and the rest of the genome is hypermethylated.  In these normal cells, CpG islands are sites
of transcription initiation.  They have a
promoter function whereby they attract proteins that create a transcriptionally
permissive chromatin state.  In cancer,
the global level of methylation in the genome decreases as normal tissues progress
to metastatic tissue (genome-wide hypomethylation), but methylation at some CpG
islands becomes more dense (locus-specific hypermethylation).  CpG island hypermethylation in cancer is
typically found in the promotors of tumor suppressor genes, where it locks in a
silent inactive state.  Silencing the
tumor suppressor gene gives that cell a competitive advantage over other cells
in the surrounding tissue, so these cells are more likely to divide more
rapidly or not die and so will take over. 
  <br /></p><p>Normally, the intergenic regions
and repetitive elements are heavily methylated, which prevents illegitimate
combinations of repeats because the chromatin is not open (the DNA is densely
packaged).  In cancer, there is
hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements, which
contributes to genomic instability because the intergenic regions and
repetitive elements are able to align and because there is open chromatin (the intergenic regions are not densely
packaged down into heterochromatin).  The
repeats are also more likely to be activated in this hypomethylated state, such that the repeats
make copies of themselves and jump around the genome or their promoters become
active.  Thus, in cancer, there is more likely to be
illegitimate combinations of repeats or inappropriate insertions or deletions
of parts of chromosomes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Igf2 promotes the growth and
division (proliferation) of cells in many tissues.  The activity of Igf2 depends on which parent
it is inherited from. Through genetic "imprinting", in most tissues the paternally inherited
copy of Igf2 is active and the maternally inherited copy is not active.  Another gene on chromosome
11 with Igf2--H19-- is also involved in growth and development.  A region of DNA 5’ to the H19 gene, known as
the H19 differentially methylated region (DMR), controls the
parent-specific genomic imprinting of both the Igf2 and H19 genes.  H19 DMR is normally methylated during the
formation of an egg or sperm cell (imprinted) only on the paternally inherited copy
of chromosome 11.  <br /></p><p>In
some cancers, disruption of methylation patterns at imprinted loci causes a loss of imprinting (LOI).  LOI at the H19 DMR causes both the paternally and maternally inherited copies of  Igf2 to be active, increasing the amount of Igf2 the cells
produce.  This may stimulate the growth of tumor cells and
prevent damaged cells from being destroyed. 
Wilms tumor, a form of kidney cancer, is due to LOI at  H19 DRM, which results in
aberrant activation of the maternally inherited allele and increased Igf2 production.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a demethylating agent.
Decitabine is structurally similar to cytidine, a nucleoside
present in DNA and RNA. In the body, Decitabine is converted into decitabine
triphosphate, which cells incorporate
directly into DNA during replication and into RNA during transcription. As a result, the enzyme methyltransferase is inhibited. Methyltransferase is responsible for methylating
newly synthesized DNA, and so the result is demethylation in that sequence. This
process adversely affects the way that cell regulatory proteins are able to bind to the
DNA/RNA substrate.<br /><br />Decitabine has an anti-tumor effect because the induction of hypomethylation in cancer cells may restore normal function to genes that are
critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation.  Specifically, Decitabine's mechanism may allow for reexpression of tumor suppressor genes, which can have a number of anti-tumor functions including repressing genes that promote cell division and initiation of apoptosis in damaged cells.<br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p></p><p>

</p><p>Alterations in DNA methylation can persist from one cell
division to the next and so can have enduring effects on the epigenome.  If a drug causes DNA hypomethylation in newly
synthesized DNA, this can be carried through to daughter
cells and, for example, cause reactivation of silenced gene expression in tumor suppressor
genes.  <br /></p><p>Prenatal development period
is the most sensitive period to environmental insults on the epigenome, as this is when imprinting occurs (i.e., epigenetic marking of genes that results
in monoallelic expression depending on parental origin).  The two most critically sensitive periods are
gametogenesis and embryogenesis (especially early preimplantation development).  During this time, major reprogramming takes place in primordial
germ cells, in which parental imprints are erased and totipotency is restored.
Imprint marks are then re-established during spermatogenesis or oogenesis,
depending on gender.  <br /></p><p>Disruption of imprinting during development can cause a wide range of adverse
effects including teratogenesis and long-term effects on physical and mental development and the ability to respond to future stresses.  It is advised that female
patients with childbearing potential avoid becoming pregnant during and 
for one month following treatment, and that male patients not father a 
child during and
for two months after treatment. </p>
