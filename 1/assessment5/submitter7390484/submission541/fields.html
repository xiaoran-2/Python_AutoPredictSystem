    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer DNA methylation is altered both in the form of hypermethylation in specific regions and genome wide Hypomethalation. The expression of oncogenes, silencing of tumour suppressors genes and loss of chromatin stability all occur in cancer and seem related to methylation changes.</p><p>In a normal cell CpG Islands are generally not methylated . These unmethylated CpG Islands are in many cases part of the promoters regulating, and sometimes even encouraging, gene expression. In cancer these Islands can become hypermethylated. Methylation of these islands silences the expression of the associated genes. When these are genes involved in house keeping tasks, like tumour suppression, they seem to be strong contributors to cancer.  </p><p>In contrast repetitive elements and intragenic regions are normally methylated. This  helps silence the repetitive regions and seems to play a role in maintaining chromatin structure and DNA integrity by assisting in the creation of heterochromatin .  With cancer this methylation can become missing.  Heterochromatin can change to euchromatin creating genomic instability as methylation is lost. The loss of methylation can also cause activation of oncogenes and an increase in DNA copying errors often involving the repetitive elements.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the maternal allele the imprint control region of Igf2 gene cluster  is normally un methylated . This  allows the  binding of the CTCF insulator protein stopping the expression are of Igf2 by blocking the action of its enhancers. This in turn causing the enhancers  to act on a secondary target expressing H19. Normally the paternal allele of the Igf2 gene cluster is methylated stopping the binding of the CTCF insulator element. The spreading of this methylation also blocks the expression of H19. Without  the CTCF insulator present down stream enhancers act to promote and express Igf2. The net effect is production of Igf2 promoting growth by the paternal allele balanced by the H19 production of the maternal allele which is thought to limit growth.</p><p>Cancers  can be caused when abnormal imprinting occurs.  In Wilm's tumour the female allele is abnormal and in the paternaly imprinted state ( both the maternal and paternal allele are methylated at the H19 promoters) This causes Igf2 to be produced by both alleles and no H19 to be  produced to leading to uncontrolled growth. </p><p></p><p></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Pharmaceutical intervention in methylation has been shown to have a positive effect in some cancers. Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent and is used in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes that leads to leukemia. Decitabine  hypomethylates DNA by blocking the action of DNA methyltransferase.  It is thought that by preventing methylation  Decitabine helps restore the operation of tumour suppressor genes helping regain control over cell growth. Decitabine  also acts as an Antimetabolite having a toxic effect that causes cell death in rapidly dividing tumor cells.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>One of the most exciting aspects of treatments based on DNA methylation is the possibility of  lasting effects. Methylation patterns are passed to daughter cells when a cell divides. This means if methylation mistakes can be corrected the 'repair' can propagate to new cells without additional treatment.  </p><p>This same propagation means great care must be taken as to when Methylation based treatment takes place. Proper methylation is laid down in a complex pattern and current approaches disturb this pattern in all cells, not just the tumour. During pregnancy and early development  rapidly dividing cells are specially sensitive to epigenetic manipulation. Epigenetic treatment at these times is not advisable as proper methylation patterns in the new cells would not be maintained. Since gamete production is on going anyone of reproductive age should be advised of the possible consequences of  epigenetic treatment on sperm or egg production as well.</p></div>
