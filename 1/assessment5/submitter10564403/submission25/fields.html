    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell, CpG islands are generally hypo-methylated (active) while in contrast, the rest of the genome is methylated and silent.  But in a cancerous cell, CpG islands and their surrounding shores are more likely to be hyper-methylated (silent), and, being found in the promoters of tumour-suppressing genes, contribute to cancer by keeping these suppressors silent which allows the cancer to grow, and disrupt normal gene function.  This particular epimutation can be more frequent than gene mutation genome-wide, but it is reversible.  (However, DNA methylation is only one hit in the Knudson Hypothesis, which states that cancer is the result of multiple hits to the DNA.) <br /><br />When the islands are hyper-methylated, other regions in the DNA, namely the intergenic regions and repetitive elements, in opposition to <i>their</i> normal hyper-methylated state, become hypo-methylated and active.  Hypo-methylation occurs most often in repetitive elements, and because these now-active repetitive elements are no longer tightly packed in the 
heterochromatin (and DNA is more 
easily accessible in the euchromatin [which
 is open chromatin]), the active repetitive elements can disrupt neighboring genes, causing genomic instability.  <br /><br />Genomic instability can occur several different ways:  deletions, reciprocal translocations (irregular recombinations), and/or insertions--both copy-and-paste insertions [retrotransposons], and jumping insertions [transposons].  In cancer, these repetitive elements can mis-align, interrupt a coding region of a gene, and can cause irregular deletions, aberrant recombinations, and/or discordant insertions to occur, contributing to metastasis, the spreading of cancer.    <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In a normal cell, at the H19/Igf2 cluster on the <em>paternal</em> allele, the ICR (imprint control region) is methylated, in turn methylating the H19 locus.  This frees the enhancers to act on and express Igf2.  Alternately in the same normal cell, at the H19/Igf2 <em>maternal</em> cluster, the ICR is unmethylated, allowing CTCF to bind to and insulate the maternal ICR.  The enhancers on the maternal allele then act on and allow expression of H19, while Igf2 is silent.<br />  <br />In Wilm's tumour, both the paternal and maternal ICRs are methylated so, CTCF cannot bind and insulate the maternal ICR.  In turn both paternal and maternal H19 loci are methylated.  Because neither paternal nor maternal enhancers can act on H19, instead, they both act on Igf2, so Igf2, a growth promoter, is doubly expressed and contributes to the growth of Wilm's tumour.    <br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine, a DNA-demethylating agent (DNMTi), can be used to slow tumour growth by de-methylating tumour-suppressing genes which, when activated, consequently, can, with other drugs and modifiers, synergistically inhibit the growth of the tumour and possibly make it more susceptible or cooperative for the successful treatment of chemotherapy.       <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Because epigenetic changes can be passed on to new cells as they divide, drugs that alter DNA methylation may have enduring effects on the epigenome by changing and possibly erasing the tumour-growth in future generation cells.<br /><br />A sensitive period occurs when, during specific periods of development, the cell is highly susceptible to environmental changes.  These changes can alter how the cells develop, possibly adversely if biochemical modifiers and regulating factors are inhibited or over-produced, especially if the factors change how/which genes will be expressed. <br /><br />The most sensitive periods of development occur when early cells are de-methylated as in the embryonic pre-implantation period through to the early post-implantation period; and from when the primordial germ cells are developed through to the maturation of the gametes.  During these and other sensitive periods of development (i.e. 8-10 years old for females, 9-12 years old for males, or other periods of cell differentiation, proliferation, migration, etc. within different tissues, especially throughout the nervous system), it would be inadvisable to treat a patient because it can adversely affect the primordial germ cells and matured gametes, which may carry the adverse affects into future generations, and as well, leave long-term adverse effects on the patient.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
