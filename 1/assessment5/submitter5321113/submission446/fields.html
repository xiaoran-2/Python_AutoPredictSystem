    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>According to
Hassler and Egger (2012), CpG islands are kept free of methylation independent
of their activity state. This is under normal condition. In cancer cells
however, CpG islands have a tendency toward hypermethylation, which leads to
gene silencing. This becomes a problem because if genes that regulation tumor
suppression are silenced, then tumors may be more prone to proliferation. </p>

<p><span>            According to McCabe et al (2009), the
normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and RE (repetitive
elements) reveals a hypermethylation status. However, in cancer, intergenic
regions are hypomethylated. Consequently, in normal cells repetitive elements
are transcriptionally silenced, while in cancer cells they are expressed more
(unsilenced). The hypomethylation of intergenic regions in cancer cells may
lead to errors in DNA replication, some of which can be insertions, deletions,
as well as reciprocal translations.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>According to
Nativio and colleagues (2011), the imprinting control region (ICR) at H19 and
IGF2 is normally methylated on the paternal allele, while it is unmethylated on
the maternal allele due to CTCF binding. Methyl marks on the paternal allele
prevent CTCF binding. This results in silencing H19. In normal cells, there is
a certain level of expression of H19 from the maternal allele and a certain
level of expression of IGF2 from the paternal allele. </p>

<p><span>            In cancer cells, when the imprinting
control region becomes hypermethylated leading to the expression of both
strands from the paternal allele. This is characterized by the over-expression
of IGF2 (which promotes proliferation) and no expression of H19, which is
typical of Wilm's tumor (Steenman et al, 1994).</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>One of the drugs
mentioned in the article from <i>The Economist</i> (2012), is Decitabine, often
sold as Dacogen. This is a DNMT inhibitor (DNA methyltransferase) and its
purpose is to lead to DNA hypomethylation. As appears in the article, this drug
is often used for the treatment of myelodysplatic syndrome, which is
characterized by the creation of deformed blood cells in the bone marrow. Such
condition may lead to a certain form of leukemia (blood cancer). The action of
Decitabine is anti-tumoral, as it can promote the reactivation of tumor
suppresor genes that have been silenced (because of hypomethylation).</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>As we have
learned in this course, there are some critical periods of epigenetic reprogramming
(such as during/before pregnancy, early fetal development, etc). These are
known as sensitive periods of development. DNA methylation is often sought to
be targeted in treatments since it can lead to lasting effects; DNMT keep
methyl marks through mitosis. Until we learn more about these processes (in
animal models and cell cultures) and until we are somewhat certain about the
interventions, it would be inadvisable to alter DNA methylation during the
sensitive periods mentioned earlier.</p>
