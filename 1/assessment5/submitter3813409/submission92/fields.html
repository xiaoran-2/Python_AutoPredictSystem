    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation occurs at CpG sequences
on DNA. Although, genome is the same in every cell in our body, there
are many different cell types with different phenotypes. This occurs due to DNA
methylation. These methylations results in an attachment of methyl group to the
cytosine molecule in a CpG region. Therefore a part of the DNA can be silenced
leading to different phenotypes. <br /></p>

<p>CpG islands have a high density of CpG sites and they are
usually found in promoter sites. These islands usually don't get methylated.
But in cancer cells, CpG islands get hypermethylated therefore the related gene
gets silenced. In cancer these are tumor suppressing
genes. Many cellular activities like DNA repair, apoptosis, cell adherence are silenced like this,
causing cancer.  </p>

<p>In normal cells, CpG
islands are protected against methylation but repetitive elements, intergenic
regions and introns of a gene can be methylated. In cancer cells, CpG islands
are hypermethylated and rest of the genome including rparts mentioned above are hypomethylated. </p>

<p>Repeats are spread throughout the genome and they
are normally kept silenced. Because when are active they can cause illegitimate
combinations between chromosomes, activate surroundings genes in terms
of the expression levels. They tend to maintain a high level of methylation
throughout two periods of epigenetic reprogramming so they are silenced. Genome-wide
hypomethylation occurs at repetitive elements and intergenic regions in cancer cells. These hypomethylations can cause genomic instability with
illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and
transposition, and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring
genes. </p>

<p>In conclusion;</p>

<p>CpG islands hypermethylation leads to silencing of tumor suppressor
genes.</p>

<p>Repetitive elements and intergenic regions hypomethylation
leads to illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and
transposition, and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring
genes.</p>

<p>And these two together leads to cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>ICR is unmethylated in maternal allele due to CTCF
protein. It insulates Igf2 from downstream
enhancers. These acts on H19 and enhances H19 expression on maternal allele. On paternal allele ICR is methylated so
CTCF cannot bind it, no insulation of Igf2. Enhancers are free to
work on Igf2. Igf2 is
expressed only from paternal allele. Without CTCF protein, DNA
methylation spreads to H19 and its silenced. </p>

<p>Igf2 promotes growth, it is oncogene. Cdkn1c is tumor suppressor
gene. If maternal Cdkn1c is lost and instead two paternal Igf2/H19 cluster is
present, you promote to much growth and don’t suppress enough of it.  These can happen due to loss of imprinting and both
alleles can behave like paternal alleles. Uniparental disomy can cause
this problem. If two parental allele copies inherited from father it can
cause BeckwithWiedemann syndrome. Furthermore this can occur due to
epigenetic disruption of DNA methylation imprints. <br /></p>

<p>Overall, if tumor suppressor gene is silenced and
Igf2/H19 oncogene cluster is active then you promote growth. Phenotype can
be  predisposition to
embryonic/childhood tumors like Wilm’s tumor. This loss of imprinting and over expression of growth promoting genes or
loss of tumor suppressor genes is a common feature in cancer cells. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">

<p class="MsoNormal">Decitabine is a DNA methyl transferase inhibitor. It
is approved for myelodysplastic syndrome. DNMTis are nucleoside
analogs. They get incorporated into the DNA upon replication and when DNMT
tries to bind nucleotide to methylate daughter strand it can no longer
be released. So for this to work you have to have the cell replicating.
Cancer cells divides rapidly so they are more severely affected. If DNMTis
used in high doses useless to getting rid of cancer cells.  Lower doses of DNMTi have an anti-neoplastic effect because it
can cause DNA demethylation, so the tumor can be killed. Decitabine is getting
tested for many other malignancies but it best Works with myelodysplastic syndrome.
The reason behind this might be the drug is working on CpG island
hypermethylation and this hypermethylation is prognosis of myelodysplastic syndrome.
And these patients tolerate DNMTis extremely well. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer treatment, drugs like DNMTis and HDACis are not
selective meaning they don’t just act on cancer cells but also other cells in
the body.  This might lead to some side effects
and long-term consequences.</p>

<p>Sensitive periods are
the periods when the epigenetic makeup can be influenced.
One sensitive period is from primordial germ cell
development to the production of mature eggs and sperms. Second sensitive
period is pre-implantation period and early post-implantation period. In both
of these sensitive periods active remodeling of the epigenome occurs. During
active remodeling we have removing and laying down epigenetic marks at
different places in the genome and these are the periods seem to be most
sensitive to changes in the environment. Altering DNA methylation during sensitive
periods might lead to lifelong consequences. </p>

<p>Therefore, epigenome altering drug therapy might not be a
good idea during sensitive periods. An example for this phenomenon is Dutch Famine.
 During Dutch Famine if the mothers
suffered low food intake during early stages of pregnancy their offspring became
more susceptible to obesity and type 2 diabetes during their adulthood. This
example shows environmental factors affecting the epigenome during sensitive
periods can have long-term consequences. </p>
