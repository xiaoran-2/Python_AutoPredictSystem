    <div class="field-value">Often times DNA methylation in cancer does a one-eighty, like a lot of epigenetic marks do in cancer. Normal cells start out by being unmethylated (open to being copied) at CpG islands, then progress into becoming more and more methylated (tightly bound, or silenced) until the cancer is in metastasis. <br /><br />Turning off, or methylating a CpG island can like wise turn off or not express tumor suppressors. Which prevent the cells from dying. Allowing them to make more copies of themselves, and for growth of the tumor.  <br /><br />On the opposite hand, intergenic regions and repeats are normally methylated. And are not open to being copied. But in cancer cells, they are unmethylated. Allowing them to be copied. Which causes a lot of genomic instability. These parts can be mixed up and copied incorrectly with a similar gene, e.i. in repeats. You can end up with double copies of an allele when there is only supposed to be one. And so on.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Normally in the Igf2/H19 cluster, on the paternal side the ICR (imprint control region) is methylated. Leading to expression of Igf2. On the maternal side, the ICR is blocked by CTCF, which leads to H19 being unmethylated and and the igf2 being blocked from expression. <br /><br />However, in Wilm's tumour the paternal allele remains the same. Igf2 is expressed. But the maternal allele is no longer blocked by CTCF, making it methylated. The CpG island H19 becomes methylated, and Igf2 is expressed. Meaning both the Paternal <strong>and </strong>the maternal alleles are expressed. Leading to over expression or biallelic expression of Igf2.<br /><br />Since Igf2 is a growth promoter, having it doubly expressed leads to the growth of the tumour in this case, Wilm's tumour.   <strong></strong></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine, is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor commonly referred to as Dacogen. It works by targeting DNA methyltransferase, or DNMTs after they are already in the DNA. As the nucelosides analogues in Decitabine bind to the DNMTs. Which stops that cell from creating further cells that have methylation carried over by the DNMTs at the site of CpG islands. The cells that were effected by the DNMTs inhibitors would need to create daughter cells. But as Cancer, or tumour cells copy themselves at a higher rate than the rest of the cells. Decitabine has more effect on tumour cells, than normal slowly dividing cells. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is a epigenetic mark, which by nature are laid down, or copied over to the daughter cells of the ones that were altered. And continue to be copied in the same way. Creating a string of permanently altered DNA methylation.<br /><br />Sensitive periods are times, just like the name implies when the epigenome is sensitive to being changed. As it is being cleared of previous marks and new ones are being placed down. Usually in early development, or in the case of primordial germ cell development. These are times when the Epigenome can either be changed for future generations in the case of germ cells, or for the life of the organism/person as in the case of early development. Making it possibly inadvisable to treat children, or mothers carrying children with epigenetic altering drugs. </div>
