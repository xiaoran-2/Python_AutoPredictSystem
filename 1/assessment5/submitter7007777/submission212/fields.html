    <div class="field-value"><span>5-methylcytosine-based DNA methylation occurs by the
covalent addition of a methyl (CH3) group at the 5-carbon of the
cytosine ring resulting in 5-methylcytosine. These methyl groups project into
the major groove of DNA and inhibit transcription. In human DNA,
5-methylcytosine is found in approximately 1.5% of genomic DNA. n somatic
cells, 5-mC occurs almost exclusively in the context of paired symmetrical
methylation a CpG site, which is a location within a DNA sequence where
cytosine and guanine appear consecutively.</span>

<p> When a CpG island in the promoter region of a gene is methylated,
expression of the gene is repressed (it is turned off). The addition of methyl
groups is controlled at several different levels in cells and is carried out by
a family of enzymes called DNA methyltransferases o DNMTs.</p><p>





Three DNMTs (DNMT1, DNMT3a and DNMT3b) a<span>re required for
establishment and maintenance of DNA methylation patterns. Two additional
enzymes (DNMT2 and DNMT3L) may also have more specialized but related
functions. DNMT1 appears to be responsible for the maintenance of established
patterns of DNA methylation, while DNMT3a and 3b seem to mediate establishment
of new or <i>de novo</i> DNA methylation patterns</span>







</p><p>In cancer cells, methylation can be disrupted, so instead see hyper
methylated  intergenic regions, there are hypo methylated, and this can produce that suppressor
genes can be silenced for the CpG islands, allowing the cell to divide more
frequently, ignoring apoptosis signals. Even if usually hypo methylation is
related with stability, during cancer processes this leads to copying errors,
such as deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations in the chromosomes. <br /></p><p>DNA methylation changes in repetitive elements (REs) are associated with
 the regulation of gene transcription, embryonic development, 
differentiation and carcinogenesis because transcription factors are not written correctly. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In normal cells the locus
H19/lgf2 is methylated from the paternal allele at the ICR, but not methylated
from maternal allele. However, the CTCF complex can enhance the maternal allele
and when this happens the downstream, enhancers on H19 become active.<br /><p>However the CTCF complex
does not work the same way with the paternal allele due the methyl marks, which
results silencing the H19 gene as the enhancers instead express lgf2.</p>

<p><span>In a normal cell, is isual to find 
methylation H19 from maternal strand and lgf2 from paternal strand, however
when ICR becomes hyper methylated, both strands are read as paternal origin and
get express as such, this is like a double dose of a process that allow grow
and promote lgf2 and the same time that silence 
H19.<br /></span></p>



<p>One characteristics of
cancer cells is the fact that they display loss of imprinting, meaning that
they no longer show an imprinting expression but rather they become either
expressed from both parental alleles or silent from both parental alleles. The
problem with this many imprinted regions are related with growth promoting or
growth supressing which is the way cancer is defined.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a Potent DNA methyltransferase
1 (DNMT1) inhibitor (IC50 = 0.2 μM). Incorporated into DNA, inhibits DNMT1 which Incorporated into DNA,
inhibits DNMT1activity to induce DNA hypomethylation. Interferes with protein
synthesis. So it is  a hypomethylating agent, by inhibing DNA methyltransferasa. The
active inhibitor in the cell is its triphosphate form (5AZA-dCTP), which
incorporates very readily into DNA to produce an inhibition of DNA
methyltransferase  this results in depletion of soluble DNMT protein levels, leading
to replication-dependent global demethylation and gene reactivation.<br /><p>The
mechanism responsible for the antileukemic action of 5AZA-CdR is related to its
reversal of epigenetic silencing by aberrant DNA methylation of genes that
suppress leukemiogenesis. 5AZA-CdR is an S-phase-specific agent. At
concentrations in the range of micromolars this analogue can induce terminal
differentiation and loss of clonogenicity of human leukemic cells (Momparter,
2005)</p><p><span>Momparter, RL. (2005)

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is a process by which a methy group are added to DNA and modifies the function of the DNA, acting to supress gene transcription. This is a very important process to normal development and processes like genomic imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, or supression of repetitive elements. <br />Pharmacology research is interested on this because . DNA methylation is one very active area since can be manipulated once and produce therapeutic effects if DNA methylferase enzymes can be preserved during mitosis. <br />A sesntive period is defined by a reprogramming moment where methylation can change and this open or close the way the DNA can be readen.<br />However this can not be done at any moment because exists    sensitive periods where there is an extensive epigenetic reprogramming. Any change to this programs can produce a bigger problem to cells. There are basicall two sensitive moments: Early development , right after egg is fertilized, the paternal and maternal genome is heavily de-methylated. The other sensitive period is after primordial germ cells are developed.<br />This means that is not possible to create treatments that should be prescribed ti pregnant mothers, because thee is a lot of re.programing happening in early development.<br /><br /></div>
