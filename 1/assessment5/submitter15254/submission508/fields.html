    <div class="field-value"><p>In mammals, DNA methylation occurs almost exclusively at CpG dinucleotides. In the genome, CpG dinucleotides are clustered into CpG islands which are found at gene promoters and methylation is associated with silencing of the downstream gene. Silencing occurs both because the additional methyl group physically impedes the binding of transcriptional machinery and because methylated DNA can be bound by methyl-CpG-binding domain proteins which in turn recruit chromatin remodellers to the locus to promote the formation of compact, transcriptionally inactive heterochromatin.</p><p> </p><p>Generally, CpG islands in cancer cells are hypermethylated i.e. they are more likely to be methylated. CpG islands tend to be found in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes, which consequently have a reduced expression in cancer cells because of hypomethylation. Cancer cells need to inactivate tumour suppressor genes, which limit cancerous behaviour such as immortality, either genetically through mutation or epigenetically by suppressing its expression. DNA methylation at the promoter CpG islands is a an effective mechanism to knock down tumour suppressor expression because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and thus provides this state of epigenetic silencing can be locked down.</p><p> </p><p>Outside of the CpG islands, the function of DNA methylation is to maintain genomic stability by promoting heterochromatin formation at intergenic and repeat regions to prevent illegitimate recombination. In cancer, non-CpG island parts of the genome are hypomethylated i.e. methylation is less likely to be observed. Consequently, there is increased genomic instability which may lead to tumourigenic mutations or genetic alterations which promote tumour progression. Repeat regions are especially prone to misalignment during replication, potentially causing insertions or deletions. These repeat elements can also make copies of themselves to be inserted into other places of the genome as transposons, which can disrupt the functioning of the recipient gene and/or disrupt genetic control mechanisms which are already in place. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>As the unmethylated imprint control
region, the maternal allele is bound by an insulator protein called CTCF, which
insulates Igf2 from the downstream enhancers. This insulation leaves the
enhancers free to act on H19, enhancing H19 expression on the maternal allele.
In contrast, on the paternal allele, the methylated imprint control region
prevents binding of CTCF, removing insulator action and allowing downstream
enhancers to act freely on Igf2 to promote its expression from the paternal
allele. H19, which is expressed on the maternal allele, is not expressed here
because of heterochromatin spreading. </p>

<p> </p>

<p><span>Because Igf2 is a growth promoter, it
can also act as an oncogene i.e. a gene which product promotes tumourigenesis.
A loss of imprinting in this region of Chromosome 11q15.5, which contains this
gene region, leads to overexpression of Igf2 if silencing on the maternal
allele is not properly established. As a result, both chromosomes behave like
the paternally derived one, upregulating Igf2 and promoting excessive cellular
growth. Thus, disrupted imprinting leads to diseases such as gigantism
(overgrowth due to increased growth promotion) or Wilm’s Tumour (cancer due to
increased oncogene expression). </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA de-methylating
agent, which hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase by being
incorporated into DNA strands as a cytidine analogue. Although the Decitabine
molecule can be added into DNA during the replication process as it base pairs
with guanine, it cannot be methylated because it does not carry a carbon at the
5’ position that is necessary for methylation. This drug is used to treat
myelodysplatic syndromes which are precursors to acute myelogenous leukaemia. </p><p> </p><p>



</p><p><span>Decitabine reverses the
hypermethylation that is typically associated with the CpG islands in the
promoters of tumour suppressor genes in cancer cells using its ability to
de-methylate DNA. Because DNA hypermethylation at the CpG islands is associated
with inappropriate silencing of the downstream gene, Decitabine allows for
re-expression of tumour suppressor genes, producing tumour suppressor protein
products such as cell cycle inhibitors which prevent continuous cell cycling, a
hallmark of cancer. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a mitotically
heritable epigenetic modification which are passed on during cell division
until they are actively erased. Cells which are the progeny to cancer cells
subjected to DNA demethylating treatment will also carry these epigenetic
marks, such as reduced methylation at CpG islands. Therefore, these progeny
cells will not have the selective advantage of the parent cancer cell of
reduced tumour suppressor gene expression. Increased expression of tumour
suppressor genes, which have the same objective as anti-cancer drugs, may lead
to these progeny cells being more sensitive to treatment than the original
cancer cell. </p>

<p> </p>

<p><span>There are 2 sensitive periods of
epigenetic reprogramming: Primordial germ cell development until eggs/sperm are
formed and the pre-implantation period until early post-implantation. Both
these stages observe active reprogramming, where existing marks are removed and
fresh ones are laid down at different places in the genome. The epigenome is
most sensitive to environmental changes at these stages, therefore treating
pregnant patients who may be carrying children at these sensitive stages in development
should not be encouraged. This is because the presence of the drug may disrupt
normal epigenetic programming, leading to disruption of normal gene control in
the unborn child. </span></p></div>
