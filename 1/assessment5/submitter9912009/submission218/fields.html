    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation serves an important function in regulating the genome and maintaining genomic stability. However, the methylation of DNA at CpG islands are often related to cancer. Thus, normally, these CpG islands, which are found in the promoters of genes, are left unmethylated. The unmethylation of CpG islands increases genomic stability, allowing expression of genes that suppress the promotion of cancer such as tumor suppressor genes. In cancer, these CpG islands become methylated, causing the complete silencing of the genes whose promoters they occur in. This is one of the many hits that lead to cancer as important genes that suppress cancer are no longer expressed. With important tumor suppressor genes no longer being expressed, cancer cells can grow and replicate freely, with DNA methylation maintained through mitosis.<br /><br />The methylation of DNA in intergenic regions and repetitive elements serve a different function than that in CpG islands. Unlike methylation in CpG islands, intergenic regions, along with repetitive elements, are usually methylated. The methylation of intergenic regions maintains genomic integrity by preventing the formation of abnormal karyotypes as a result of duplications, translocations, deletions and insertions. Methlylation of these regions also lead to the silencing of cryptic transcription start sites found in them. The silencing of repetitive elements maintains genomic integrity by preventing the transposition of these genes to other places in the genome that may cause illegitimate recombination and by silencing strong promoters that may be found in repetitive elements, preventing transcriptional interference. In many types of cancer, these parts of the genome are found to become hypomethylated, allowing abnormalities in chromosome structure, transcriptional interference of important genes, transposition of repeats, and/or the increased expression of certain genes such as oncogenes. All these irregularities will lead to the uncontrollable replication of cancer cells and eventually to metastasis. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation plays an important role in the H19/Igf2 cluster. On the paternal allele, the imprint control region (ICR) becomes methylated, blocking the binding of CTCF, a protein that insulates the Igf2 gene from enhancers. Without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads downstream to the H19 promoter, silencing the H19 gene. Enhancers can access and now activate Igf2, which is the preferred loop. Thus, Igf2 is expressed on the paternal allele. However, on the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated, allowing CTCF binding. CTCF blocks the enhancers from acting on Igf2, and instead, the enhancers now activate H19. Thus, Igf2 is not expressed on the maternal allele while H19 is.<br /><br />In Wilm's tumor, the ICR that controls the H19/Igf2 cluster becomes hypermethylated on the maternal allele, causing it to behave like the paternal allele. This causes underexpression of H19 and overexpression of Igf2 since CTCF cannot bind to the methylated ICR on the maternal allele to prevent Igf2 expression and since DNA methylation spreads to the H19 promoter, silencing the H19 gene. This disruption contributes to cancer as Igf2 is growth promoting. Because the cell is now receiving an overdose of Igf2, uncontrolled cell growth will occur, leading to cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, meaning it removes methyl groups from methylated cytosines found in DNA (removes methylation marks from DNA). Decitabine can have an anti-tumor effect several ways. One way it can have such an effect is by removing methylation found in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes. Tumor suppressor genes are often methylated in cancer, leading to their silencing. As a result, malignant cells are allowed to grow uncontrollably and rapidly. Thus, by removing these methylation marks, tumor suppressor genes can be actively expressed and bring cell division under control, halting growth tumor growth. Another way Decitabine can have an anti-tumor effect is by removing methylation from ICRs. In the case of the H19/Igf2 cluster, hypermethylation of the ICR on the maternal allele leads to overexpression of Igf2, which is growth promoting. By removing the methylation of the ICR, normal imprinted expression and cell growth can be restored.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is an epigenetic change, meaning it is also mitotically heritable. Because of this mitotic heritability, DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome. The DNA of targeted cells can be manipulated once, and DNA methyltranferases can maintain the methylation marks, even through mitosis. However, there are times when such drugs should not be used, one of which is during pregnancy. Throughout the 40 weeks of pregnancy (give or take 2 weeks), there are periods of time, called sensitive periods, that the embryo undergoes extensive epigenetic reprogramming. These periods of reprogramming occur in preimplantation embryo development and primordial germ cell development. It is extremely inadvisable to undergo epigenetic treatment such as DNA-demethylation drugs during these time periods because a lot of reprogramming of the epigenetic marks is occurring, and disrupting the process can result in early embryonic lethality as well as germ cell tumors.</div>
