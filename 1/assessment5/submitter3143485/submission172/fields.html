    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, the CpG islands are hypomethylated, allowing the activation
of tumor suppressor genes. In cancer, the CpG islands and CpG islands shores
are hypermethylated. These regions are associated with tumor suppressor genes.  Therefore, in cancer, we’ll see silencing of
the tumor suppressor genes, allowing, by this fact, that abnormal cell advances
to hyperplasia, neoplasia or invasion. This fact is amplified since dna
methylation is mitotically heritable, making this feature very common in
tumors.</p>

<p>In intergenic regions and repeats we normally see an
hypermethylation, inhibiting their transcription. This fact is essential for
the genomic stability essential for a normal development.In cancer, we see an hypomethylation of these two regions,
therefore their activation. This state leads to genomic instability, allowing
illegitimate recombination between repeats an the activation of repeats and
transposition, disrupting neighbouring genes. This features contributes the disruption of the normal cell cycle, therefore cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the paternal allele we see an methylated of the imprint control regions (ICR), inhibiting the connection of the CTCF to these regions, and so the enhancers are allowed to express the Igf2. In the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated. So, the CTCF is capable to connect to the ICR, allowing that the enhancers act in the H19, silencing the Igf2 of the maternal allele. So, in the normal state, we only see expression of Igf2 in the paternal state.<br />In Wilm's tumuor, we see an loss of imprinting in the maternal allele, with the hypermethylation of the ICR and by this fact, the activation of the Igf2 in the maternal allele.<br />So, in Wilm's tumour, we'll see an overexpression of Igf2 ( an growth promoter),  since Igf2 is active in both alleles.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is an <span> DNA-demethylating agent or an hypomethylating agent. This molecule block's DNA methyltransferase activity, inhibiting the methylation of DNA. This can trigger an anti-tumor effect since decitabine can hypomethylate tumor supressor genes, allowing their expression. By this way, this molecule contributes to regulate the tumor </span>growth and survival, inhibiting the cancer progress.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">When we alter a DNA methylation pattern we can trigger an enduring effect in the epigenome because we have mitotic heritability of the genetic state, meaning, when we alter the pattern of DNA methylation, this new pattern will be passed to daughter cells by mitose, enduring is effects. In epigenetic control we can define sensitive periods as periods when altered environments can have an effect in epigenetic control. In mammals, we can define two sensitive periods regarding epigenetic: pre implantation and post implantation until epiblast fase and primordial germ cells development until germ cells production. <br />When we treat patients whit drugs that have an effect in the epigenetic control (as decitabine described in the previous question), we have to be very careful, because the effect of the drug can have an transgenerational effect in the epigenome if the treatment is applied in an sensitive period. This changes in the epigenome would be transmitted by the parents via germ cells to the offspring or would have effect in the normal epigenome imprinting of the DNA of the foetus  in a pregnant women.</div>
