    <h1>Submission 231 from Anon (session_user_id: d0536ab20964a13cec7fdf773fdaed564a09420e)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine, sold as Dacogen by Eisai, is a DNA-demethylating agent. This drug inhibits the hypermethylation seen in cancer, like leukemia, by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase (DNMT3A). This leads to hypomethylation of the CpG islands and growth suppressor genes, which will leads to suppression of cancer growth. It is now being used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, a condition that may develop to acute myelogenous leukaemia.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value">The CpG islands are usually in the promoters of the tumor suppressor genes. In normal cells, these CpG islands are hpomethylated, and so the tumor suppressor genes are expressed. But in cancer, these CpG islands are hypermethylated instead and that leads to silencing of the tumor suppressor genes. On the other hand, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are important for the stability of the DNA and they are hypermethylated in normal cells. In the case of cancer, hypermethylation of these regions occur. As a result, there will be genomic instability in the form of illigitimate recombination, activation and transposition of repeats.This happens because the repeats are normally heavily methylated and tightly packaged but the hypomethylation seen in cancer and the loose packaging makes the repeats free to move around and disrupts other regions of the DNA which may leads to deletion, insertion or reciprocal translocation of genes.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">The ICR is normally methylated in the paternal allele and because of that, the enhancers can reach the Igf2 and it will be expressed. On the other hand, the ICR of the maternal allele binds to CTCF so the enhancers can not reach the Igf2 and instead they activate the H19. In the case of cancer, because of hypermythelation, the ICR in both the paternal and the maternal alleles are methylated. That will lead to overexpression of the Igf2, which is a growth promoter. This disruption is seen in Wilm's tumour and other cancers. <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">One of the features of the epigenetic mechanisms, DNA methylation in this case, is that they are mitotically heritable. So once a gene is methylated, it will stay methylated in the daughter and granddaughter cells. But there are periods where most of these epigenetic marks are erased. These periods are called sensitive periods. The sensitive period is the period when epigenetic reprogramming occur and it is more susceptible to environmental changes. In humans, there are two main sensitive periods: the primordial germ cells developmental period and the early embryonic developmental period. Treating patients during these periods may disturb the reprogramming machinery. That will make the DNA unstable and will lead to various problems in the embryo or the germ cells.<br /></div>
