    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">                  Epigenetics role in cancer is vital, since its characteristics are necessary in regulation of gene expression;therefore suppressing of tumor suppressor genes and activation of oncogene leads to deregulated gene expressions.<br />                     <br />               There are several drugs that affect epigenetic machinery, one of such drugs is Decitabine, it belongs to a class of epigenetic inhibitors known as DNA demethylation and antimetabolite agents. Since DNA methylation is a mode for regulating gene expression, hypermethylation can block the function of important suppressor genes which control growth and cell division.<br /><br />                       Decitabine interferes with DNA methylation;Demethylation leads to restoration of crucial tumor suppressor genes which in turn controls cell growth.The anti tumor effect comes into play when patients are given low dosages of Decitabine. Anti-tumor memory inhibits growth of subset populations of self renewing cells that resemble cancer stem cells,decreased methylation of promoters genome wide, changes in regulatory pathways and gene re-expression have been some observable changes. <br />                         </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value">              DNA methylation either expresses or silences a gene expression, if unmethylated transcription factors can bind thus activating gene expression; if its methylated the transcription factors cant bind thus resulting in gene silencing. CpG islands are sites for transcription intiation thus influencing local chromatin structure and simplifying regulation of gene activity. The CpG islands in a normal cell are unmethylated, they are located at the promoter region which is involved in active transcription process.<br /><br />             The CpG islands in cancer become hypermethylated, thus causing gene silencing to take place; primary genes like tumor suppressor genes get silenced. The methylated cytosine is highly unstable predisposing it to genetic mutations compared with unmethylated cytosine. Since the tumor suppressor genes are silenced, the oncogenes are left unchecked to propagate at fast paced growth leading to cancer of various types. The hypermethlation varies by tumor type and progresses with time, the DNA hypermethylation biomarkers are used for sensitive diagnosis, accurate prognosis and effective treatment.<br /><br />                 In a normal cell DNA methylation is present in intergenic regions and repetitive elements to maintain genomic stability. The repeats should always be  silenced to prohibit illegitimate recombinations which can lead to instability in the genome. The repeats are silenced so they dont jump around the genome causing disruption in other coding regions and altering their normal function.<br /><br />              The repeats and intergenic regions are hypomethylated in cancer which causes genomic instability by allowing illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of transponsition, activation of cryptic promoters which disrupt neighbouring genes. Insertions,deletions and reciprocal translocations are signs of abnormal karyotype caused by unstable genome.<br />     <br />                Disruptions of DNA methylation contribute to cancer because it increases karyotype instability and activating tumor promoting genes with cis and trans effects which may alter euchromatin and heterochromatin interactions thus promoting cancer. There is a clear relationship between hypomethlation and tumorogenisis.<br /><br />                  </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">                   Genomic imprinting is a mechanism where alleles of specific genes are represented differentially in parent of origin specific manner. The differentiation marking occurs in gametic stage or during early embryonic development stage. The vital role of imprinted genes is to control growth and cell propagation;Therefore disruption of imprinted  genes can cause tumor growth and cancer.<br />                     The H19/IGF2 cluster is located on chromosome 11p15.5, H19 acts as tumor suppressor meanwhile IGF2 is a growth promoter. The paternal allele is methylated thus blocking the CTFC binding and methylation spreads to promoter of H19 silencing it; now enhancers can access IGF2 and therefore IGF2 is expressed. The maternal allele is demethylated which allows CTFC protein which insulates IGF2 from enhancers; therefore enhancers can only act on H19 and IGF2 is not expressed.<br />                      <br />                   Wilm‘s tumor is a childhood kidney cancer. The loss of imprinting at the ICR of H19/IGF2 cluster and uniparental dismoy where two copies of a chromosome come from same parent, leading to overexpression of IGF2. Insulin like growth factor when overexpressed, it can easily promote tumor growth.The disruption in imprinting at H19/IGF2 cluster contributes to cancer because overexpression of IGF2 leads to tumorogenisis whereas H19 ha a role of tumor suppressor.<br />                    </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">             The alteration of DNA methylation have profound effects on epigenome because it is mitotically heritable and these alterations are passed on to daughter cells and onwards until its erased.Since there is aberrant levels of methylation involved in cancer,if by usage of drugs they can be returned to normalization, there is hope for better prognosis.Epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation are reversible unlike genetic mutations.<br /><br />              The periods of epigenetic reprogramming are sensitive periods,where any alteration or removal can cause abnormalities which can lead to onset of diseases. There are two sensitive periods in early embryonic development and primordial germ cell development. In embryonic development maternal and paternal genomes are cleared and reset and imprinted genes are cleared and reset and depending on the sex of the embryo gender specific imprinting takes place. In PGC development maternal and paternal genomes are cleared and reset but imprinted genes maintain their parent of origin marks.<br />                     <br />              Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because it can have a profound affect on their epigenome. A pregnant female at the stage of early embryonic development, therefore a sensitive period;if treated can have her three lineages affected, herself,her child and grandchild due to presence of germ cells.</div>
