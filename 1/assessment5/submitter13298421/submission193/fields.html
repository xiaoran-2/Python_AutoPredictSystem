    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>

        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.

    <div class="field-value"><div><span>Decitabine or 5-alza-2'-desoxycytidine is a cytidine analog, which works as an specific inhibitor of DNA methylation and it is used as a treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) but It also can be used to the treatment of solid tumors (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decitabine">1</a>,<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25130173">2</a>,<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3478887/">3</a>).<br /><br />The hypermethylation of some promoter genes (CpG) islands in cancer is correlated with a low gene expression. Decitabine acts as a potent inhibitor of the DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) induced an hypomethylation of DNA in neoplastic cells (<a href="http://www.nature.com/leu/journal/v14/n11/full/2401914a.html">4</a>, <a href="http://www.nature.com/leu/journal/v23/n6/full/leu2008397a.html">5</a>).

    <div class="field-value"><div>DNA methylation is the addition of methyl groups to the DNA and it occurs almost exclusively at Cs of CpG dinucleotide. DNA methylation is laid down by methyltramsferases (DNMT3a and DMNT3b) and maintained through the development by DMNT1. Most of CpG clusters are into the CpG islands often at the promoters of genes and it tends to be protected from methylation. CpG methylated at the CpG island is associated with the formation of a repressive chromatine structure and  it means the silencing of the gene expression, X inactivation etc (<a href="https://class.coursera.org/epigenetics-003/lecture/13">1</a>, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3480634/">2</a>).<br /><br />In spite of CpG islands are protected from DNA methylation in cancer cells promoter it tends to be hypermetylated. This hypermetylated of CpG islands in cancer cells are correlated with silencing of  tumor-suppressor genes, which controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair. It contributed to abnormal development of cells at last it leads to tumourigenesis (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3480634/">2</a>).<br /><br />Intergenic regions and repetitive elements usually are highly methylated and the function of this methylation is maintained genome integrity in fact the cells without DMNT1 display genome instability.  (<a href="https://class.coursera.org/epigenetics-003/lecture/13">1</a>, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3480634/">2</a>). In normal cells Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are silenced by DNA methylation to prevent aberrations due to genome instability (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3480634/">2</a>, <a>4</a>) DNA hypomethylation was the initial epigenetic abnormality found in human tumors and it occurred early in tumourigenesis. Hypomethylation can leads to  delections, reciprocal translocation  and indirect effects on gene expression (<span><a href="https://class.coursera.org/epigenetics-003/lecture/101">3</a>)</span></div><div><span><br /></span></div></div>

        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.

    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.

    <div class="field-value"><div><div><span>DNA methylation could be an excellent target in a cancer treatment. Change in the DNA methylation by DNA methyltramsferases, are transmitted to the next cell generation as a epigenetic mark, the laid down of the epigenetic mark just occurs during the cellar division ( mitosis).(<a href="http://epigenie.com/epigenie-learning-center/epigenetics/epigenetic-regulation/">1</a>, <a href="https://class.coursera.org/epigenetics-003/lecture/7)">2</a>)</span></div><div><span><br />Sensible periods are stage of high reprogramming when epigenetic mark are being maintained through the development.

So this treatment would be inadmissible during the pregnancy even a few months before, the gametogenesis.</span></div></div>
