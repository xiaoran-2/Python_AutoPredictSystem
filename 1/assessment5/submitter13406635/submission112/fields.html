    <div class="field-value">     CpG islands are often found at the promoter region of genes and tend to be protected from methylation.  As a general rule, they are unmethylated.  There are exception in the case of X-inactivation imprinting, and heterochromatin formation.  In summary, in a normal cell,  the CpG islands are hypomethylated while the genome itself is methylated in the repetitive elements, the intergenic regions, and the introns of genes.  <br />     In contrast to the normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands, genomic hypermethylation in cancer is most frequent in CpG islands in tumor suppressor genes.  This contributes to cancer by stopping the formation of the proteins that will suppress tumor formation.  <br />      Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated.  The normal function of DNA methylation at intergenic regions is to maintain genomic integrity and stability and to silence cryptic transcription start or splice sites.  The function of DNA methylation at repetitive elements is also to maintain genomic integrity by silencing repeats to prevent transposition and possible illegitimate recombination.  DNA methylation at these sites protects the genome from transposable elements.  <br />    In contrast, DNA hypomethylation occurs in intergenic regions and repetitive elements in cancer.  A consistent feature of all cancers is a genome-wide lack of methylation at the intergenic regions and repetitive elements.  This hypomethylation leads to genomic instability due to deletions, reciprocal translocations and insertions.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">      The H19/Igf2 gene cluster on chromosome 11 is imprinted paternally.  Through the mechanism of enhancer blocking and imprint control region (ICR) methylation, the paternal chromosome expresses IgF2, a growth promoter and oncogene.  The maternal allele is silenced by hypomethylating the ICR which is then bound by an insulator protein, CTCF.       It insulates the maternal IgF2 from  downstream enhancers (suppresses IgF2) which in turn enhance the expression of H19.  On the paternal allele whose ICR is methylated, the CTCF insulator protein is not able to bind.  This, in turn, leads to the enhancers' promoting the expression of IgF2 from the paternal allele.   The DNA methylation at the paternal allele's ICR spreads downstream and represses the expression of the paternal H19.   <br /><br />IgF2 promotes growth and is an oncogene.   Hypermethylation of the ICR on the maternal allele with the H19/IgF2 complex results in overexpression of the growth promoting gene, IgF2, from the previously silenced maternal allele.  This can lead to the childhood kidney tumor known as Wilm's tumor.  Similarly, loss of imprinting at the  H19/Igf2 cluster can lead to expression of both the maternal and paternal alleles, hence over-expression of  the growth promoter, IgF2.  <br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is an enzymatic regulator, specifically, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi).     It is a nucleoside analogue, which irreversibly binds DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA.  Its action is dependent on cell replication.  Since cancer cells replicate more rapidly than normal cells, they will be more severely affected by decitabine.  <br /><br />It has an FDA indication for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) progressed to acute myeloid leukemia (AML).   It may be especially effective for MDS because of the significance of CpG hypermethylation in the disease.  Through the action of DNA demethylation, decitabine restores the function of tumor suppressor genes which were previously inhibited by the hypermethylation of CpG islands in the cancer state.  The DNMTi function of decitabine in MDS occurs most effectively at low doses which also leads to less toxicity.  Decitabine may have other mechanisms of action which are not fully characterized.  <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><br />Altering DNA methylation with epigenetic drugs can have enduring effects on the epigenome because every cell has the potential to be affected and because the epigenetic drugs are incorporated into the DNA targeted site (to which they irreversibly bind).   As the cells of the person being treated replicate, the incorporated epigenetic effects become mitotically reproduced.  <br />   Sensitive periods of epigenetic development are Pre-Implantation Development and Germ Cell Development.   These are critical times when extensive epigenetic reprogramming occurs.  <br />     It is inadvisable to treat pregnant women or women of child-bearing age unless it is clear they are not pregnant.  Children should also not be treated with epigenetic drugs since the long-term effects of these epigenetic changes on reproduction and over a lifetime on the epigenome are not known.  </div>
